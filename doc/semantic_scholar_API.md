# Scripts for Semantic Scholar API

<b>NOTE</b>: Many of the programs below support the environment variable, SPECTER_API_KEY.
This can be set to a secret, which is important for heavy usage.  Ask me for the secret, if
you are interested.
<p>
In addition to the functionality described here, there is also a bulk download process described <a href="bulk_download/semantic_scholar_bulk_download.md">here</a>.
This file describes how to request much of that data by ad hoc requests.
<p>
The Semantic Scholar API is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api">here</a>.
<p>
The following describes a number of simple scripts in this github that provide functions such as these:
<ol>
<li>Input paper ids; output useful fields (as json)</li>
<li>Input paper ids; output references and citations (as tsv)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fetch Titles</h2>


```sh
echo 'DeepWalk' | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_title.py
# 3 matches:	DeepWalk
fff114cbba4f3ba900f33da574283e3de7f26c83	DeepWalk: online learning of social representations	DeepWalk
689c72d2374b22ebca6ac7b588d84bc87f3b3109	DeepWalking: Enabling Smartphone-Based Walking Speed Estimation Using Deep Learning	DeepWalk
f6bdc38fd4665a25f79dc37a462045a07c79a639	DeepWalk: Omnidirectional Bipedal Gait by Deep Reinforcement Learning	DeepWalk
```

<h2>Fetch from Semantic Scholar API</h2>
Some examples of usage

```sh
echo 232040593 | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
# {'paperId': '6d9727f1f058614cada3fe296eeebd8ec4fc512a', '
#              externalIds': {'DBLP': 'conf/fat/BenderGMS21', 'DOI': '10.1145/3442188.3445922', 'CorpusId': 232040593},
#              'title': 'On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ'}}`
```

There are many ways to specify paper ids.  All of these produce the same results:
```sh
echo 9558665 | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
echo 9e2caa39ac534744a180972a30a320ad0ae41ea3 | $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
echo 'ACL:J90-1003' | $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
echo 'MAG:3031337294' | $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
echo 'DOI:10.3115/981623.981633' | $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds
```

The argument to --fields can make use of the following:
<ol>
<li>title</li>
<li>abstract</li>
<li>authors</li>
<li>externalIds (Semantic Scholar receives data from 7 sources: MAG (182M papers), DOI (114M papers), PubMed (35M), DBLP (6M), PubMedCentral (5M), ArXiv (2M), ACL (80k) </li>
<li>citationCount</li>
<li>referenceCount</li>
<li>citations (list of (up to 1000) papers)</li>
<li>references (list of (up to 1000) papers)</li>
<li>embedding (vector of 768 floats from Specter 1, a BERT-like model; this vector encodes titles and abstracts)</li>
<li>venue</li>
<li>fieldsOfStudy</li>
<li>s2fieldsOfStudy</li>
<li>openAccessPdf (URL to pdf versions of paper)</li>
<li>tldr (too long; didn't read -- summaries, often based on abstracts</li>
<li>citationStyles (bibtex entries)</li>
</ol>
(See <a href="https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/">here</a> for more information on these arguments (and more).)
<p>
For example, the following will return an embedding (in addition to the title and externalIds):

```sh
echo 9558665 | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --fields title,externalIds,embedding
```

In addition to ad hoc requests, Semantic Scholar also supports bulk downloads, where
you can download many of these same fields for all papers in the system.  They provide
snapshots (releases) every few weeks.
<p>
There is also support for querying by authors:

```sh
echo 2244184 | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --API author --fields name,externalIds,hIndex,paperCount,citationCount | head
# {'authorId': '2244184', 'externalIds': {'DBLP': ['K. H. Church',
#   'Kenneth Church', 'Kenneth Church 0001', 'Kenneth W. Church',
#   'Kenneth Ward Church'], 'ORCID': '0000-0001-8378-6069'}, 'name':
#   'Kenneth Ward Church', 'paperCount': 225, 'citationCount': 18694,
#   'hIndex': 52}

# Output a list of papers with titles and citations
echo 2244184 | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_from_semantic_scholar_api.py --API author --fields name,externalIds,hIndex,paperCount,citationCount,papers.title,papers.citationCount
```

Generate a list of papers for an author, sorted by citations:

```sh
echo 2244184 |python $JSALTsrc/fetch_papers_from_authors.py | awk 'NR >  1' | sort -k4 -nr -t'	' | head
```

<h2>References and Citations</h2>

The following will output up to 1000 lines, one for each reference.
It will also output up to 1000 lines, one for each citation.  The
first line is a summary with the count of references and citations
(which may exceed 1000).  Subsequent lines start with either
"reference" or "citation".  The next two ids are the corpusId for the
query and the reference/citation.  The last two columns are the number
of citations and the title of the paper.

```sh
echo 232040593 | python $JSALTsrc/fetch_references_and_citations.py | head
query	156 references	1113 citations	On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ
