Semantic Scholar has lots of links like this:
https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Online-Speaker-Diarization-with-Graph-based-Label-Zhang-Lin/9d5644d416f2110f983acda61f75fd09b84e6d3e
https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Ming-Li/2150652518

You actually don't need the full URL.  The following links will redirect to the ones above
https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9d5644d416f2110f983acda61f75fd09b84e6d3e
https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2150652518

I will refer to the last bit of the URLs above as ids.  There are lots of different types of ids floating around

corpusid
paperid
authorid
PMID (pubmed id)
PMC
DOI
DBLP
MAG
ACL
ArXiv
...

If you have the DOI, then you can get more info from links like this:

http://doi.org/10.1038/425242a
https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/425242a

NOTE that DOI matching can be a bit tricky.  Spaces are sometimes permitted.  Case doesn't seem to matter (at least in some places):

These links all point to the same place as above:

https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/425242A
https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/425242%20A

If you have any of these ids, you can get many other fields with something like this:

I'm working on better ways to join CorpusId (from semantic scholar) to PMID (from pubmed).
Some of that work is in: /work/k.church/ids

You should add this to your PATH
which find_lines
/work/k.church/semantic_scholar/citations/graphs/src/C/find_lines

This will convert semantic scholar CorpusId to a URL:

echo 10350567 | find_lines --input /work/k.church/semantic_scholar/papers/papers2url.V2/lines2html.V2
10350567	<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6056eef3a7267a329f36f19e517c0dcf1f8e863e">0: The analysis of main macroeconomic variable's shock effect to CPI</a>

The raw data for semantic scholar comes from 30 pieces in 7 directories like this:

find /work/k.church/semantic_scholar  -maxdepth 3 -name '*piece.001.gz'
/work/k.church/semantic_scholar/abstracts/abstracts.piece.001.gz
/work/k.church/semantic_scholar/authors/authors.piece.001.gz

/work/k.church/semantic_scholar/s2orc/s2orc.piece.001.gz
/work/k.church/semantic_scholar/tldrs/tldrs.piece.001.gz

They refer to these 7 directories as databases.  They come from the
5/31/2022 snapshot of semantic scholar using the bulk download API
(see https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api).

# Here is a one line description of each paper:

The papers table has stuff about each corpusid.  There is a corpusid
for each of the nearly 250M papers in the system.  These papers come
from ACL, DBLP, ArXiv, MAG, etc.  Many of of these corpusids have one
or more external ids.  Warning: I am finding the same paper in many of
these external sources.  They report some (but not all) matches.  I'd
like to join them across more sources because some of these other
sources offer features (like similar papers) that are different from
the features in semantic scholar.

The embedding table has specter embeddings for each corpusid.  That is a vector of 768 floats.

Those embeddings are used in the following scripts

I computed a citation matrix from the following table.  This table has
a bunch of fields that I didn't use.  Citations are classified as
influential (or not).  They also provide some context around each
citation.

# I use this tool on the following annoy objects: /work/k.church/semantic_scholar/embeddings/M3/semantic_scholar_embedding_near.py

# The proposed method uses node2vec to construct embeddings from the citation graph (see ~kwc/final/morphology/dict_to_embedding.py)
# dict_to_embeddings.py uses https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0594.pdf (nodevectors.ProNE from https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors)

I just got a CSV export of the whole IATE EU terminology database onto Discovery at /home/yue.r/terminology_management/IATE_export.csv.
 
It seems the file has no header, but it includes English term, target language, equivalent term in target language, and a reliability indicator that specifies if the provided term has been reviewed by a domain expert.
 
TermID|English term|Target language|Equivalent term|Term type|Reliability|
 
Two examples:
 
892670|financial institutions and credit|it|operatore in opzioni|Term|Minimum reliability|
3619545|political culture|fr|culture de l'effacement|Term|Reliable|
 
Should be a good source for cross-checking terminology from Scibert.

I made two versions of the crawler, one works on PDFs and the other grabs EN and FR abstracts directly from the page description. PDF crawler still needs some regex refining. 40 abstracts available in FR and EN at /home/yue.r/cardiac_arrest.

  abstract =   {Pre-training and fine-tuning, e.g., BERT&nbsp;\citep{devlin2018bert}, have achieved great success in language understanding by transferring knowledge from rich-resource pre-training task to the low/zero-resource downstream tasks. Inspired by the success of BERT, we propose MAsked Sequence to Sequence pre-training (MASS) for the encoder-decoder based language generation tasks. MASS adopts the encoder-decoder framework to reconstruct a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence: its encoder takes a sentence with randomly masked fragment (several consecutive tokens) as input, and its decoder tries to predict this masked fragment. In this way, MASS can jointly train the encoder and decoder to develop the capability of representation extraction and language modeling. By further fine-tuning on a variety of zero/low-resource language generation tasks, including neural machine translation, text summarization and conversational response generation (3 tasks and totally 8 datasets), MASS achieves significant improvements over the baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods. Especially, we achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy (30.02 in terms of BLEU score) on the unsupervised English-French translation, even beating the early attention-based supervised model&nbsp;\citep{bahdanau2015neural}.}

that is where all of the "errors" are at...

On a positive note

[7:34 AM] Ortega, John
there are about 100 more than before (originally we had 60 runs now we have 167 good ones)

My script is there also: get_prone_benchmarks.sh (there are two more scripts in there for getting the edges)

I will get back to this later today
