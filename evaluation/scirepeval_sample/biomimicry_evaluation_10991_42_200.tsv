Rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms is a major issue for public healthcare. A way to obtain an individual rupture risk assessment is a main objective of many research teams in the world. For many years, we have investigated the relationship between the mechanical properties of aneurysm wall tissues and the rupture risk. In this work, we try to go further and investigate rupture limit values.


METHODS
Following surgical clipping, a specific conservation protocol was applied to aneurysmal tissues in order to preserve their mechanical properties. Thirty-nine intracranial aneurysms (27 females, 12 males) were tested using a uniaxial tensile test machine under physiological conditions, temperature, and saline isotonic solution. These represented 24 unruptured and 15 ruptured aneurysms. Stress/strain curves were then obtained for each sample, and a fitting algorithm was applied following a Yeoh hyperelastic model with 2 parameters. Moreover, uniaxial tensile tests were conducted until rupture of samples to obtain values of stress and strain rupture limit.


RESULTS
The significant parameter a C2 of the hyperelastic Yeoh model, allowed us to classify samples' rigidity following the terminology we adopted in previous papers (Costalat et al., 2011; Sanchez et al., 2013): Soft, Stiff and Intermediate. Moreover, strain/stress rupture limit values were gathered and analyzed thanks to the tissue rigidity, the status of the aneurysm (initially ruptured or unruptured) and the gender of the patient.


CONCLUSION
Strain rupture limit was found quite stable around 20% and seems not to be correlated with the status of the aneurysm (initially ruptured or unruptured), neither with the gender of the patient. However, stretch and stress rupture limit seems not to be independent on the rigidity. The study confirms that ruptured aneurysms mainly present a soft tissue and unruptured aneurysms present a stiff material."	0	Journal of biomechanics

In fasting pythons, oxyntopeptic cells located within the fundic glands are typically non-active, with a thick apical tubulovesicular system and numerous zymogen granules. They become active immediately after feeding but return to a non-active state 3 days after the ingestion of the prey. The proton pump, expressed throughout the different fasting/feeding states, is either sequestered in the tubulovesicular system in non-active cells or located along the apical digitations extending within the crypt lumen in active cells. The sodium pump is rapidly upregulated in fed animals and is classically located along the baso-lateral membranes of the gastric oxyntopeptic cells. In the intestine, it is only expressed along the lateral membranes of the enterocytes, i.e., above the lateral spaces and not along the basal side of the cells. Thus, solute transport within the intestinal lining is mainly achieved through the apical part of the cells and across the lateral spaces while absorbed fat massively crosses the entire height of the cells and flows into the intercellular spaces. Therefore, in the Burmese python, the gastrointestinal cellular system quickly upregulates after feeding, due to inexpensive cellular changes, passive mechanisms, and the progressive activation and synthesis of key enzymes such as the sodium pump. This cell plasticity also allows anticipation of the next fasting and feeding periods.	1	Zoological Science

Optical clearing of biological tissues improves imaging depth for light transmission imaging modalities such as two-photon microscopy. In studies that investigate the interplay between microstructure and tissue-level mechanics, mechanical testing of cleared tissue may be useful. However, the effects of optical clearing on soft tissue mechanics have not been investigated. Thus, we set out to quantify the effects of a simple and effective optical clearing protocol on the mechanics of soft collagenous tissues using ovine mitral valve anterior leaflets as a model system. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an isotonic glycerol-DMSO optical clearing protocol in two-photon microscopy. Second, we evaluate the mechanical effects of optical clearing on leaflets under equibiaxial tension in a dependent study design. Lastly, we quantify the shrinkage strain while traction-free and the contractile forces while constrained during clearing. We found the optical clearing protocol to improve two-photon imaging depth from ~100 μm to ~500-800 μm, enabling full-thickness visualization of second-harmonic generation, autofluorescent, and fluorophore-tagged structures. Under equibiaxial tension, cleared tissues exhibited reduced circumferential (p < 0.001) and radial (p = 0.009) transition stretches (i.e. stretch where collagen is recruited), and reduced radial stiffness (p = 0.031). Finally, during clearing we observed ~10-15% circumferential and radial compressive strains, and when constrained, ~2mN of circumferential and radial traction forces. In summary, we suggest the use of this optical clearing agent with mechanical testing be done with care, as it appears to alter the tissue's stress-free configuration and stiffness, likely due to tissue dehydration.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Our aim with this article is to bring the existing methodology of group sequential designs to the attention of researchers in the preclinical field and to clearly illustrate its potential utility. Group sequential designs can offer higher efficiency than traditional methods and are increasingly used in clinical trials. Using simulation of data, we demonstrate that group sequential designs have the potential to improve the efficiency of experimental studies, even when sample sizes are very small, as is currently prevalent in preclinical experimental biomedicine. When simulating data with a large effect size of d = 1 and a sample size of n = 18 per group, sequential frequentist analysis consumes in the long run only around 80% of the planned number of experimental units. In larger trials (n = 36 per group), additional stopping rules for futility lead to the saving of resources of up to 30% compared to block designs. We argue that these savings should be invested to increase sample sizes and hence power, since the currently underpowered experiments in preclinical biomedicine are a major threat to the value and predictiveness in this research domain.	0	PLoS biology

"Our previous studies used tibial compression overload to induce anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture in mice, while others have applied similar or greater compressive magnitudes without injury. The causes of these differences in injury threshold are not known. In this study, we compared knee injury thresholds using a ""prone configuration"" and a ""supine configuration"" that differed with respect to hip, knee, and ankle flexion, and utilized different fixtures to stabilize the knee. Right limbs of female and male C57BL/6 mice were loaded using the prone configuration, while left limbs were loaded using the supine configuration. Mice underwent progressive loading from 2 to 20 N, or cyclic loading at 9 N or 14 N (n = 9-11/sex/loading method). Progressive loading with the prone configuration resulted in ACL rupture at an average of 10.2 ± 0.9 N for females and 11.4 ± 0.7 N for males. In contrast, progressive loading with the supine configuration resulted in ACL rupture in only 36% of female mice and 50% of male mice. Cyclic loading with the prone configuration resulted in ACL rupture after 15 ± 8 cycles for females and 24 ± 27 cycles for males at 9 N, and always during the first cycle for both sexes at 14 N. In contrast, cyclic loading with the supine configuration was able to complete 1,200 cycles at 9 N without injury for both sexes, and an average of 45 ± 41 cycles for females and 49 ± 25 cycles for males at 14 N before ACL rupture. These results show that tibial compression configurations can strongly affect knee injury thresholds during loading."	0	Journal of biomechanics

We find that specific alterations in the expression of most UC enzymes occur in many tumors, leading to a general metabolic hallmark termed ""UC dysregulation"" (UCD). UCD elicits nitrogen diversion toward carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD) activation and enhances pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in detectable changes in nitrogen metabolites in both patient tumors and their bio-fluids. The accompanying excess of pyrimidine versus purine nucleotides results in a genomic signature consisting of transversion mutations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. This mutational bias is associated with increased numbers of hydrophobic tumor antigens and a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors independent of mutational load. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that UCD is a common feature of tumors that profoundly affects carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and immunotherapy response."	0	Cell

However, the appearance of DNA sequence motifs recognized by transcription factors may turn TRs into functional cis-regulatory elements, thus favoring their stabilization in genomes. Here, we show that, in human cells, the transcriptional repressor ZEB1, which promotes the maintenance of mesenchymal features largely by suppressing epithelial genes and microRNAs, occupies TRs harboring dozens of copies of its DNA-binding motif within genomic loci relevant for maintenance of epithelial identity. The deletion of one such TR caused quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to reacquire epithelial features, partially recapitulating the effects of ZEB1 gene deletion. These data demonstrate that the high density of identical motifs in TRs can make them suitable platforms for recruitment of transcriptional repressors, thus promoting their exaptation into pre-existing cis-regulatory networks.	0	Cell

Each ommatidium possesses five radially arranged retinular cells producing a square fused rhabdom by R1–R4 cells; the smaller R5 exists between R1 and R4. The size of R5 rhabdomere is larger in the dorsal part and becomes smaller in the median and ventral parts of the eye. Spectral-sensitivity by electroretinograms were recorded from dorsal or ventral parts of the eye. The dorsal part possesses maxima at green and UV-blue region. The main response region in the ventral part is only from UV (390 nm) to blue (430 nm) decreasing at longer wavelengths. To evaluate the sandhoppers’ celestial orientation, their eyes were painted black either in the dorsal or ventral part, under the natural sky or a blue filter with or without the vision of the sun. Sandhoppers with the dorsal region of the eyes painted and tested under the screened sun were more dispersed and their directions varied more than in other groups of individuals. Sandhoppers with this area of the eye obscured display considerable difficulties to head in a specific direction. This work suggests the existence of regional specializations in the eye of T. saltator.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

A crystal structure of the putative N-carbamoylsarcosine amidase (CSHase) Ta0454 from Thermoplasma acidophilum was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined at a resolution of 2.35A. CSHases are involved in the degradation of creatinine. Ta0454 shares a similar fold and a highly conserved C-D-K catalytic triad (Cys123, Asp9, and Lys90) with the structures of three cysteine hydrolases (PDB codes 1NBA, 1IM5, and 2H0R). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ta0454/N-carbamoylsarcosine and Ta0454/pyrazinamide complexes were performed to determine the structural basis of the substrate binding pattern for each ligand. Based on the MD-simulated trajectories, the MM/PBSA method predicts binding free energies of -24.5 and -17.1 kcal/mol for the two systems, respectively. The predicted binding free energies suggest that Ta0454 is selective for N-carbamoylsarcosine over pyrazinamide, and zinc ions play an important role in the favorable substrate bound states.	0	Journal of structural biology

Rare dynamic events or specific objects can be identified, targeted and imaged by electron microscopy or tomography. To combine it with structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy or tomography, fluorescence microscopy must be performed while maintaining the specimen vitrified at liquid-nitrogen temperatures and in a dry environment during imaging and transfer. Here we present instrumentation, software and an experimental workflow that improves the ease of use, throughput and performance of correlated cryo-fluorescence and cryo-electron microscopy. The new cryo-stage incorporates a specially modified high-numerical aperture objective lens and provides a stable and clean imaging environment. It is combined with a transfer shuttle for contamination-free loading of the specimen. Optimized microscope control software allows automated acquisition of the entire specimen area by cryo-fluorescence microscopy. The software also facilitates direct transfer of the fluorescence image and associated coordinates to the cryo-electron microscope for subsequent fluorescence-guided automated imaging. Here we describe these technological developments and present a detailed workflow, which we applied for automated cryo-electron microscopy and tomography of various specimens.	0	Journal of structural biology

Here, we show that the traditional approach only vaguely represents evolutionary relationships, fails to denote major events in the history of life, and relies heavily on memorizing near-meaningless taxonomic ranks. Conversely, a clade-based strategy—focused on common ancestry, monophyletic groups, and derived functional traits—is explicitly based on Darwin’s “descent with modification,” provides students with a rational system for organizing the details of biodiversity, and readily lends itself to active learning techniques. We advocate for a phylogenetic classification that mirrors the TOL, a pedagogical format of increasingly complex but always hierarchical presentations, and the adoption of active learning technologies and tactics.	0	PLoS biology

Although many mobile genes provide strong benefits to their hosts, the fitness consequences of the process of transfer itself are less clear. In previous studies, transfer has been interpreted as a parasitic trait of the MGEs because of its costs to the host but also as a trait benefiting host populations through the sharing of a common gene pool. Here, we show that costly donation is an altruistic act when it spreads beneficial MGEs favoured when it increases the inclusive fitness of donor ability alleles. We show mathematically that donor ability can be selected when relatedness at the locus modulating transfer is sufficiently high between donor and recipients, ensuring high frequency of transfer between cells sharing donor alleles. We further experimentally demonstrate that either population structure or discrimination in transfer can increase relatedness to a level selecting for chromosomal transfer alleles. Both mechanisms are likely to occur in natural environments. The simple process of strong dilution can create sufficient population structure to select for donor ability. Another mechanism observed in natural isolates, discrimination in transfer, can emerge through coselection of transfer and discrimination alleles. Our work shows that horizontal gene transfer in bacteria can be promoted by bacterial hosts themselves and not only by MGEs. In the longer term, the success of cells bearing beneficial MGEs combined with biased transfer leads to an association between high donor ability, discrimination, and mobile beneficial genes. However, in conditions that do not select for altruism, host bacteria promoting transfer are outcompeted by hosts with lower transfer rate, an aspect that could be relevant in the fight against the spread of antibiotic resistance.	0	PLoS biology

One of the major methodological challenges in single particle electron microscopy is obtaining initial reconstructions which represent the structural heterogeneity of the dataset. Random Conical Tilt and Orthogonal Tilt Reconstruction techniques in combination with 3D alignment and classification can be used to obtain initial low-resolution reconstructions which represent the full range of structural heterogeneity of the dataset. In order to achieve statistical significance, however, a large number of 3D reconstructions, and, in turn, a large number of tilted image pairs are required. The extraction of single particle tilted image pairs from micrographs can be tedious and time-consuming, as it requires intensive user input even for semi-automated approaches. To overcome the bottleneck of manual selection of a large number of tilt pairs, we developed an algorithm for the correlation of single particle images from tilted image pairs in a fully automated and user-independent manner. The algorithm reliably correlates correct pairs even from noisy micrographs. We further demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm by using it to obtain initial references both from negative stain and unstained cryo datasets.	0	Journal of structural biology
13	231857781	10.1098/RSPB.2020.2676	231857781	Dragondrop: a novel passive mechanism for aerial righting in the dragonfly	Dragonflies perform dramatic aerial manoeuvres when chasing targets but glide for periods during cruising flights. This makes dragonflies a great system to explore the role of passive stabilizing mechanisms that do not compromise manoeuvrability. We challenged dragonflies by dropping them from selected inverted attitudes and collected 6-degrees-of-freedom aerial recovery kinematics via custom motion capture techniques. From these kinematic data, we performed rigid-body inverse dynamics to reconstruct the forces and torques involved in righting behaviour. We found that inverted dragonflies typically recover themselves with the shortest rotation from the initial body inclination. Additionally, they exhibited a strong tendency to pitch-up with their head leading out of the manoeuvre, despite the lower moment of inertia in the roll axis. Surprisingly, anaesthetized dragonflies could also complete aerial righting reliably. Such passive righting disappeared in recently dead dragonflies but could be partially recovered by waxing their wings to the anaesthetised posture. Our kinematics data, inverse dynamics model and wind-tunnel experiments suggest that the dragonfly's long abdomen and wing posture generate a rotational tendency and passive attitude recovery mechanism during falling. This work demonstrates an aerodynamically stable body configuration in a flying insect and raises new questions in sensorimotor control for small flying systems.	1	Proceedings of The Royal Society B: Biological Sciences

"The discovery of pits/caveolae in the plasmalemma advanced the study of macromolecule internalization. ""Transcytosis"" describes the transport of macromolecular cargo from one front of a polarized cell to the other within membrane-bounded carrier(s), via endocytosis, intracellular trafficking and exocytosis. Clathrin-mediated transcytosis is used extensively by epithelial cells, while caveolae-mediated transcytosis mostly occurs in endothelial cells. The internalization pathways were monitored by various markers, including radioisotopes, nanoparticles, enzymes, immunostains, and fluorophores. We describe an internalization pathway identified using a naturally-occurring biomarker, in vivo assembled ferritin, containing electron-dense iron cores. Iron, an essential trace metal for most living species and iron homeostasis, is crucial for cellular life. Ferritin is a ubiquitous and highly conserved archeoprotein whose main function is to store a reserve iron supply inside the cytoplasm in a non-toxic form. Ferritin is present in all organisms which have a metabolic requirement for iron and in even in organisms whose taxonomic rank is very low. The newborns of the blind mole, Spalax ehrenbergi, are born and live in a hypoxic environment and have significant iron overload in their liver and heart, but their iron metabolism has not been previously studied. These newborns, which are evolutionarily adapted to fluctuations in the environmental oxygen, have a unique ability to sequester transplacental iron and store it in ferritin without any signs of iron toxicity. Using the ferrihydrite cores of ferritin, we were able to monitor the ferritin internalization from portals of its entry into the cytosol of hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes and into the lysosomes."	0	Journal of structural biology

By analysing high-coverage genome sequence data from 4 major colour pattern loci sampled from nearly 600 individuals in 53 populations, we show pervasive selection on wing patterns in the Heliconius adaptive radiation. The strongest signatures correspond to loci with the greatest phenotypic effects, consistent with visual selection by predators, and are found in colour patterns with geographically restricted distributions. These recent sweeps are similar between co-mimics and indicate colour pattern turn-over events despite strong stabilising selection. Using simulations, we compare sweep signatures expected under classic hard sweeps with those resulting from adaptive introgression, an important aspect of mimicry evolution in Heliconius butterflies. Simulated recipient populations show a distinct ‘volcano’ pattern with peaks of increased genetic diversity around the selected target, characteristic of sweeps of introgressed variation and consistent with diversity patterns found in some populations. Our genomic data reveal a surprisingly dynamic history of colour pattern selection and co-evolution in this adaptive radiation.	0	PLoS biology
16	155104632	10.1016/J.CELL.2019.04.013	155104632	Molecular Basis for poly(A) RNP Architecture and Recognition by the Pan2-Pan3 Deadenylase	Summary The stability of eukaryotic mRNAs is dependent on a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPC1/Pab1) organized on the poly(A) tail. This poly(A) RNP not only protects mRNAs from premature degradation but also stimulates the Pan2-Pan3 deadenylase complex to catalyze the first step of poly(A) tail shortening. We reconstituted this process in vitro using recombinant proteins and show that Pan2-Pan3 associates with and degrades poly(A) RNPs containing two or more Pab1 molecules. The cryo-EM structure of Pan2-Pan3 in complex with a poly(A) RNP composed of 90 adenosines and three Pab1 protomers shows how the oligomerization interfaces of Pab1 are recognized by conserved features of the deadenylase and thread the poly(A) RNA substrate into the nuclease active site. The structure reveals the basis for the periodic repeating architecture at the 3′ end of cytoplasmic mRNAs. This illustrates mechanistically how RNA-bound Pab1 oligomers act as rulers for poly(A) tail length over the mRNAs’ lifetime.	0	Cell

Wing scales of male Euploea mulciber (E. mulciber) and Troides aeacus (T. aeacus) butterflies were investigated from interest in photonic crystal by scanning electron microscopy and optical reflectance measurement. On the basis of the structural observation, the colouration in different areas in their wings was discussed. It was particularly deduced that a violet-green iridescence characteristic of E. mulciber's forewing is caused only in a wavelength range from ∼380 to ∼510nm by multiple interference from a highly tilted, triple-layered cuticle arrangement on the brown scales. It was also found that T. aeacus does not produce a blue-green sheen such as observed by Troides magellanus because its scales have no multiple cuticle layers but microrib layers unable to produce any backscattering diffraction.	0	Journal of structural biology
18	67858642	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2006250	67858642	A Notch-mediated, temporal asymmetry in BMP pathway activation promotes photoreceptor subtype diversification	Neural progenitors produce neurons whose identities can vary as a function of the time that specification occurs. Here, we describe the heterochronic specification of two photoreceptor (PhR) subtypes in the zebrafish pineal gland. We find that accelerating PhR specification by impairing Notch signaling favors the early fate at the expense of the later fate. Using in vivo lineage tracing, we show that most pineal PhRs are born from a fate-restricted progenitor. Furthermore, sister cells derived from the division of PhR-restricted progenitors activate the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway at different times after division, and this heterochrony requires Notch activity. Finally, we demonstrate that PhR identity is established as a function of when the BMP pathway is activated. We propose a novel model in which division of a progenitor with restricted potential generates sister cells with distinct identities via a temporal asymmetry in the activation of a signaling pathway.	0	PLoS biology
19	229316319	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.3000987	229316319	Daptomycin treatment impacts resistance in off-target populations of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.	The antimicrobial resistance crisis has persisted despite broad attempts at intervention. It has been proposed that an important driver of resistance is selection imposed on bacterial populations that are not the intended target of antimicrobial therapy. But to date, there has been limited quantitative measure of the mean and variance of resistance following antibiotic exposure. Here we focus on the important nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium in a hospital system where resistance to daptomycin is evolving despite standard interventions. We hypothesized that the intravenous use of daptomycin generates off-target selection for resistance in transmissible gastrointestinal (carriage) populations of E. faecium. We performed a cohort study in which the daptomycin resistance of E. faecium isolated from rectal swabs from daptomycin-exposed patients was compared to a control group of patients exposed to linezolid, a drug with similar indications. In the daptomycin-exposed group, daptomycin resistance of E. faecium from the off-target population was on average 50% higher than resistance in the control group (n = 428 clones from 22 patients). There was also greater phenotypic diversity in daptomycin resistance within daptomycin-exposed patients. In patients where multiple samples over time were available, a wide variability in temporal dynamics were observed, from long-term maintenance of resistance to rapid return to sensitivity after daptomycin treatment stopped. Sequencing of isolates from a subset of patients supports the argument that selection occurs within patients. Our results demonstrate that off-target gastrointestinal populations rapidly respond to intravenous antibiotic exposure. Focusing on the off-target evolutionary dynamics may offer novel avenues to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance.	0	PLoS biology

Here, we present LIBRA-seq (linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing), a technology for high-throughput mapping of paired heavy- and light-chain BCR sequences to their cognate antigen specificities. B cells are mixed with a panel of DNA-barcoded antigens so that both the antigen barcode(s) and BCR sequence are recovered via single-cell next-generation sequencing. Using LIBRA-seq, we mapped the antigen specificity of thousands of B cells from two HIV-infected subjects. The predicted specificities were confirmed for a number of HIV- and influenza-specific antibodies, including known and novel broadly neutralizing antibodies. LIBRA-seq will be an integral tool for antibody discovery and vaccine development efforts against a wide range of antigen targets.	0	Cell
21	96221597	10.1002/ADFM.201001546	96221597	Self‐Sharpening Mechanism of the Sea Urchin Tooth	The sea urchin tooth is a mosaic of calcite crystals shaped precisely into plates and fibers, cemented together by a robust calcitic polycrystalline matrix. The tooth is formed continuously at one end, while it grinds and wears at the opposite end, the sharp tip. Remarkably, these teeth enable the sea urchin to scrape and bore holes into rock, yet the teeth remain sharp rather than dull with use. Here we describe the detailed structure of the tooth of the California purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and focus on the self-sharpening mechanism. Using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy (X-PEEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX analysis, nanoindentation, and X-ray micro-tomography, we deduce that the sea urchin tooth self-sharpens by fracturing at discontinuities in the material. These are organic layers surrounding plates and fibers that behave as the “fault lines” in the tooth structure, as shown by nanoindentation. Shedding of tooth components at these discontinuities exposes the robust central part of the tooth, aptly termed “the stone”, which becomes the grinding tip. The precise design and position of the plates and fibers determines the profile of the tooth tip, so as the tooth wears it maintains a tip that is continually renewed and remains sharp. This strategy may be used for the top-down or bottom-up fabrication of lamellar materials, to be used for mechanical functions at the nano- and micrometer scale.	1	Advanced Functional Materials

The whole thigh muscles are covered with the fascia lata, which could have morphological and mechanical features that match the underlying muscles' functions. In this study, we investigated the morphological and elastic properties of the human fascia lata taken from four (anterior, medial, lateral, and posterior) sites on the thigh of 17 legs of 12 cadavers (6 males and 6 females, 75-92 years). The thickness of the fascia lata was determined with a caliper. The interwoven collagen fiber's directions were measured and classified into longitudinal, transverse, and diagonal in two opposing directions, relative to the thigh. Tensile strength test along the longitudinal and transverse directions was performed, and the stiffness, Young's modulus, and hysteresis were determined. Fascia lata at the lateral site (0.8 ± 0.2 mm) was significantly thicker compared to other sites (0.2-0.3 mm). Fiber's directions showed substantial variability among sites, and longitudinally directed fibers were higher in proportion (28-32%) than those in other directions (20-27%) at all sites except for the posterior site. The stiffness and Young's modulus in the longitudinal direction (20-283 N/mm; 71.6-275.9 MPa, highest at the lateral site) were significantly higher than in the transverse direction (3-16 N/mm; 3.2-41.9 MPa, lowest at the lateral site). At the medial site, the proportion of the transversely directed fibers was higher in females than males, with higher stiffness and Young's modulus thereof. The present study shows that the fascia lata possesses site- and gender-dependence of the morphological characteristics and elastic properties.	0	Journal of biomechanics

The unique shape of modern human feet, and how they change shape when loaded are thought to be integral to effective upright gait. This unique shape, and the natural variations therein, have previously been analysed using a range of methods; from visual assessments, anthropometric measurements, and footprints, to x-ray, ultrasound and magnetic resonance images. However, these methods are often limited by their use of linear two-dimensional measures. Only recently have advances in three-dimensional (3D) scanning technology and statistical shape analysis been applied to studying 3D foot shape variations. Given their novelty, information regarding the reliability and repeatability of 3D foot scanning and shape modelling is lacking. To investigate whether repeated foot scans captured by two examiners give the same 3D shape and produce consistent statistical shape models, 17 healthy adults' left feet were scanned while bearing half and full bodyweight, as well as minimal weight. Surface to surface distances between corresponding foot meshes and differences between shape model quality criteria were both found to be small and insignificant. The only exception being the specificity criterion for minimally loaded foot scans. Furthermore, Euclidean vectors were used to model the magnitude and direction of deformation that feet undergo as a consequence of increased loading. The deformation models showed that loading a minimally loaded foot results in greater, but less consistent, shape changes than when increasing the load on an already loaded foot. These results show that the utilized methods offer a valuable, reliable and repeatable approach to analysing foot shape and deformation.	0	Journal of biomechanics
25	285828	10.1016/J.JSB.2016.01.011	285828	A detailed look at the cytoskeletal architecture of the Giardia lamblia ventral disc.	Giardia lamblia is a protistan parasite that infects and colonizes the small intestine of mammals. It is widespread and particularly endemic in the developing world. Here we present a detailed structural study by 3-D negative staining and cryo-electron tomography of a unique Giardia organelle, the ventral disc. The disc is composed of a regular array of microtubules and associated sheets, called microribbons that form a large spiral, held together by a myriad of mostly unknown associated proteins. In a previous study we analyzed by cryo-electron tomography the central microtubule portion (here called disc body) of the ventral disc and found a large portion of microtubule associated inner (MIPs) and outer proteins (MAPs) that render these microtubules hyper-stable. With this follow-up study we expanded our 3-D analysis to different parts of the disc such as the ventral and dorsal areas of the overlap zone, as well as the outer disc margin. There are intrinsic location-specific characteristics in the composition of microtubule-associated proteins between these regions, as well as large differences between the overall architecture of microtubules and microribbons. The lateral packing of microtubule-microribbon complexes varies substantially, and closer packing often comes with contracted lateral tethers that seem to hold the disc together. It appears that the marginal microtubule-microribbon complexes function as outer, laterally contractible lids that may help the cell to clamp onto the intestinal microvilli. Furthermore, we analyzed length, quantity, curvature and distribution between different zones of the disc, which we found to differ from previous publications.	0	Journal of structural biology
26	38069243	10.1016/J.JSB.2011.03.006	38069243	Biochemical and structural characterization of the capsid-bound tegument proteins of human cytomegalovirus.	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most genetically and structurally complex human herpesvirus and is composed of an envelope, a tegument, and a dsDNA-containing capsid. HCMV tegument plays essential roles in HCMV infection and assembly. Using cryo electron tomography (cryoET), here we show that HCMV tegument compartment can be divided into two sub-compartments: an inner and an outer tegument. The inner tegument consists of densely-packed proteins surrounding the capsid. The outer tegument contains those components that are loosely packed in the space between the inner tegument and the pleomorphic glycoprotein-containing envelope. To systematically characterize the inner tegument proteins interacting with the capsid, we used chemical treatment to strip off the entire envelope and most tegument proteins to obtain a tegumented capsid with inner tegument proteins. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses show that only two tegument proteins, UL32-encoded pp150 and UL48-encoded high molecular weight protein (HMWP), remains unchanged in their abundance in the tegumented capsids as compared to their abundance in the intact particles. Three-dimensional reconstructions by single particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) reveal that the net-like layer of icosahedrally-ordered tegument densities are also the same in the tegumented capsid and in the intact particles. CryoET reconstruction of the tegumented capsid labeled with an anti-pp150 antibody is consistent with the biochemical and cryoEM data in localizing pp150 within the ordered tegument. Taken together, these results suggest that pp150, a betaherpesvirus-specific tegument protein, is a constituent of the net-like layer of icosahedrally-ordered capsid-bound tegument densities, a structure lacking similarities in alpha and gammaherpesviruses.	0	Journal of structural biology
27	47017314	10.1098/RSOS.171323	47017314	Structural design of the minute clypeasteroid echinoid Echinocyamus pusillus	The clypeasteroid echinoid skeleton is a multi-plated, light-weight shell construction produced by biomineralization processes. In shell constructions, joints between individual elements are considered as weak points, yet these echinoid skeletons show an extensive preservation potential in both Recent and fossil environments. The remarkable strength of the test is achieved by skeletal reinforcement structures and their constructional layouts. Micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy are used for microstructural and volumetric analyses of the echinoid's skeleton. It is shown that strengthening mechanisms act on different hierarchical levels from the overall shape of the skeleton to skeletal interlocking. The tight-fitting and interlocking plate joints lead to a shell considered to behave as a monolithic structure. The plate's architecture features distinct regions interpreted as a significant load-transferring system. The internal support system follows the segmentation of the remaining skeleton, where sutural layout and stereom distribution are designed for effective load transfer. The structural analysis of the multi-plated, yet monolithic skeleton of Echinocyamus pusillus reveals new aspects of the micro-morphology and its structural relevance for the load-bearing behaviour. The analysed structural principles allow E. pusillus to be considered as a role model for the development of multi-element, light-weight shell constructions.	1	Royal Society Open Science

High foot elevation during obstacle crossing is viewed as a conservative strategy in older adults, but excessive foot elevation may result in large mediolateral center of mass (CoM) displacement. Since an incorrect transfer of CoM can lead to balance loss during locomotion, both appropriate foot elevation and CoM position must be controlled and coordinated by adjusting body segment positions. However, no studies have revealed time profiles of CoM position by coordinated segment movements and the relation of foot elevation with CoM position during obstacle crossing. Twenty-five healthy older adults crossed an obstacle (depth: 1 cm, width: 60 cm, height: 8 cm) during comfortable-speed walking. Synergy indices were calculated during lead- and trail-limb swing using uncontrolled manifold analysis. High synergy index values indicate a strong multi-joint kinematic synergy, or co-fluctuations in segment movements, to control CoM position. The maximum foot heights of the swing limbs were calculated as the maximum vertical distance between the most distal foot point and the ground. In the mediolateral direction, synergy index values during early lead-limb swing were significantly greater than during early trail-limb swing, and in the vertical direction, large synergy index values were found during early- and mid-swing phases. Moreover, maximum trail-foot height was correlated to vertical synergy index during early phase. CoM position was not well controlled by a kinematic synergy during trail-limb swing and the low control of CoM position was observed with great trail-foot height. The results suggest that a conservative strategy with great trail-foot height would not always be helpful for successful obstacle crossing.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Our results demonstrated that 6 days of estivation in normoxia led to up-regulation of mRNA expressions of several genes related to urea synthesis, including carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (Cps), argininosuccinate synthetase and glutamine synthetase. They indicate that increased urea synthesis, despite being energy-intensive, is an important adaptive response of estivation. They also offer indirect support to the proposition that urea synthesis in this lungfish involved a Cps that uses glutamine as a substrate. In addition, up- or down-regulation of several gene clusters occurred in the liver of P. annectens after 6 days of estivation in normoxia. These estivation-specific genes were involved in the prevention of clot formation, activation of the lectin pathway for complement activation, conservation of minerals (e.g. iron and copper) and increased production of hemoglobin beta. Since there were up- and down-regulation of mRNA expressions of genes related to ribosomal proteins and translational elongation factors, there could be simultaneous increases in protein degradation and protein synthesis during the first 6 days (the induction phase) of estivation, confirming the importance of reconstruction of protein structures in preparation for the maintenance phase of estivation.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B
30	73425502	10.1016/J.JBIOMECH.2019.01.043	73425502	Reliability and robustness of muscle architecture measurements obtained using diffusion tensor imaging with anatomically constrained tractography.	For detailed analyses of muscle adaptation mechanisms during growth, ageing or disease, reliable measurements of muscle architecture are required. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DTI tractography have been used to reconstruct the architecture of human muscles in vivo. However, muscle architecture measurements reconstructed with conventional DTI techniques are often anatomically implausible because the reconstructed fascicles do not terminate on aponeuroses, as real muscle fascicles are known to do. In this study, we tested the reliability of an anatomically constrained DTI-based method for measuring three-dimensional muscle architecture. Anatomical magnetic resonance images and diffusion tensor images were obtained from the left legs of eight healthy participants on two occasions one week apart. Muscle volumes, fascicle lengths, pennation angles and fascicle curvatures were measured in the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus and the tibialis anterior muscles. Averaged across muscles, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99 for muscle volume, 0.81 for fascicle length, 0.73 for pennation angle and 0.76 for fascicle curvature. Measurements of muscle architecture obtained using conventional DTI tractography were highly sensitive to variations in the stopping criteria for DTI tractography. The application of anatomical constraints reduced this sensitivity significantly. This study demonstrates that anatomically constrained DTI tractography can provide reliable and robust three-dimensional measurements of whole-muscle architecture. The algorithms used to constrain tractography have been made publicly available.	0	Journal of biomechanics

"X-ray diffraction of the indirect flight muscle (IFM) in living Drosophila at rest and electron microscopy of intact and glycerinated IFM was used to compare the effects of mutations in the regulatory light chain (RLC) on sarcomeric structure. Truncation of the RLC N-terminal extension (Dmlc2(Delta2-46)) or disruption of the phosphorylation sites by substituting alanines (Dmlc2(S66A, S67A)) decreased the equatorial intensity ratio (I(20)/I(10)), indicating decreased myosin mass associated with the thin filaments. Phosphorylation site disruption (Dmlc2(S66A, S67A)), but not N-terminal extension truncation (Dmlc2(Delta2-46)), decreased the 14.5nm reflection intensity, indicating a spread of the axial distribution of the myosin heads. The arrangement of thick filaments and myosin heads in electron micrographs of the phosphorylation mutant (Dmlc2(S66A, S67A)) appeared normal in the relaxed and rigor states, but when calcium activated, fewer myosin heads formed cross-bridges. In transgenic flies with both alterations to the RLC (Dmlc2(Delta2-46; S66A, S67A)), the effects of the dual mutation were additive. The results suggest that the RLC N-terminal extension serves as a ""tether"" to help pre-position the myosin heads for attachment to actin, while phosphorylation of the RLC promotes head orientations that allow optimal interactions with the thin filament."	0	Journal of structural biology

The radula owes most of its abrasive capability to the presence of numerous mineralized teeth. Here we report on the shape, internal structure, wearing pattern, feeding position, and distribution of hardness and elastic properties of these teeth in an attempt to generate ideas for the innovation of industrial cutting devices. The teeth remain sharp during their entire working-life mainly due to the fact that wearing preferentially occurs along surfaces formed by the internal structure of the tooth. It is shown that shape, internal structure, positioning and material characteristics concertedly function in minimizing the rate at which the teeth wear down and in maintaining optimal cutting behaviour. Implementation of these self-sharpening characteristics into industrial cutting devices is discussed.	1	Materials Science and Engineering: C

The recently discovered Type IIL MmeI family of restriction-and-modification (RM) enzymes that possess a shared target recognition domain provides a framework for engineering such new specificities. However, a lack of structural information on Type IIL enzymes has limited the repertoire that can be rationally engineered. We report here a crystal structure of MmeI in complex with its DNA substrate and an S-adenosylmethionine analog (Sinefungin). The structure uncovers for the first time the interactions that underlie MmeI-DNA recognition and methylation (5’-TCCRAC-3’; R = purine) and provides a molecular basis for changing specificity at four of the six base pairs of the recognition sequence (5’-TCCRAC-3’). Surprisingly, the enzyme is resilient to specificity changes at the first position of the recognition sequence (5’-TCCRAC-3’). Collectively, the structure provides a basis for engineering further derivatives of MmeI and delineates which base pairs of the recognition sequence are more amenable to alterations than others.	0	PLoS biology

The rest of the eye is dominated by green-sensitive photoreceptors. Using patch clamp we studied dissociated ommatidia of nocturnal adults and diurnal eight-instar nymphs with the goals (1) of characterizing the biophysical properties of cricket photoreceptors in general and (2) describing the functionally dissimilar blue- and green-sensitive photoreceptors in terms of voltage-gated channel composition and signal coding. Despite different lifestyles, adult and nymph photoreceptors were indistinguishable. No significant circadian changes were observed in K+ currents. In contrast, prominent differences were seen between blue- and green-sensitive photoreceptors. The former were characterized by relatively low absolute sensitivity, high input resistance, slow quantum bumps with long latencies, small light-induced and K+ currents and low steady-state depolarization. Information rate, a measure of photoreceptor performance calculated from voltage responses to bandwidth-limited white noise-modulated light contrast, was 87 ± 8 bits s−1 in green-sensitive photoreceptors vs. 59 ± 14 bits s−1 in blue-sensitive photoreceptors, implying a limited role of DRA in the perception of visual contrasts. In addition, evidence of electrical coupling between photoreceptors is presented.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

To understand how these fishes cope with hyposmotic stress on a cellular level, we used the spiny dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) as a model to test whether a reciprocal relationship exists between the cell’s two primary protein protection mechanisms, the chemical (e.g., trimethylamine oxide, TMAO) and molecular (e.g., heat shock protein 70, HSP70) chaperone systems. This relationship is interesting given that many elasmobranchs are expected to gain water and lose osmolytes, chemical chaperones, and ions as they osmoconform to new, lowered salinity. Dogfish were cannulated for repeated blood sampling and exposed to 70 % seawater (SW) for 48 h. These hyposmotic conditions had no effect on red blood cell (RBC) and white muscle TMAO concentrations, and did not result in HSP70 induction or signs of protein damage (i.e., increased ubiquitin), suggesting that TMAO levels were sufficiently protective in these tissues. However, in the gill, we observed a significant decrease in TMAO concentration and a significant induction of HSP70 as well as signs of protein damage. In the face of this cellular stress response, gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity significantly increased during hyposmotic conditions, as expected. We suggest that this functional preservation in the gill is partly the result of HSP70 induction with lowered salinity. We conclude a reciprocal relationship between TMAO and HSP70 in the gills of dogfish as a result of in vivo hyposmotic stress. When osmotically induced protein damage surpasses the protective capacity of remaining TMAO, HSP70 is induced to preserve tissue and organismal function.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

Although dietary antioxidant supplementation or activation of endogenous antioxidants by NRF2 reduces oxidative stress and promotes early lung tumor progression, little is known about its effect on lung cancer metastasis. Here, we show that long-term supplementation with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and vitamin E promotes KRAS-driven lung cancer metastasis. The antioxidants stimulate metastasis by reducing levels of free heme and stabilizing the transcription factor BACH1. BACH1 activates transcription of Hexokinase 2 and Gapdh and increases glucose uptake, glycolysis rates, and lactate secretion, thereby stimulating glycolysis-dependent metastasis of mouse and human lung cancer cells. Targeting BACH1 normalized glycolysis and prevented antioxidant-induced metastasis, while increasing endogenous BACH1 expression stimulated glycolysis and promoted metastasis, also in the absence of antioxidants. We conclude that BACH1 stimulates glycolysis-dependent lung cancer metastasis and that BACH1 is activated under conditions of reduced oxidative stress.	0	Cell

Honeybees followed the stationary part of the floor at a given height. On encountering the moving part of the floor, which moved in the same direction as their flight, honeybees descended and flew at a lower height, thus gradually restoring their ventral optic flow (OF) to a similar value to that they had percieved when flying over the stationary part of the floor. This was therefore achieved not by increasing their airspeed, but by lowering their height of flight. These results can be accounted for by a control system called an optic flow regulator, as proposed in previous studies. This visuo-motor control scheme explains how honeybees can navigate safely along tunnels on the sole basis of OF measurements, without any need to measure either their speed or the clearance from the surrounding walls.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

Chrysina gloriosa LeConte 1854, a scarab beetle found in montane juniper forests of the extreme southwestern United States and northern Mexico, are camouflaged in juniper foliage; however, when viewed with right circularly polarizing filters, the beetles exhibit a stark black contrast. Given the polarization‐specific changes in the appearance of C. gloriosa, we hypothesized that C. gloriosa can detect circularly polarized light. We tested for phototactic response and differential flight orientation of C. gloriosa toward different light stimuli. Chrysina gloriosa exhibited (a) positive phototaxis, (b) differential flight orientation between linear and circularly polarized light stimuli of equal intensities, and (c) discrimination between circularly polarized and unpolarized lights of different intensities consistent with a model of circular polarization sensitivity based on a quarter‐wave plate. These results demonstrate that C. gloriosa beetles respond differentially to circularly polarized light. In contrast, Chrysina woodi Horn 1885, a close relative with reduced circularly polarized reflection, exhibited no phototactic discrimination between linear and circularly polarized light. Circularly polarized sensitivity may allow C. gloriosa to perceive and communicate with conspecifics that remain cryptic to predators, reducing indirect costs of communication.	1	The American Naturalist

Experiments show that leaflets with acuminate tips have an improved water-shedding ability. A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED to test the effects of leaf shape and leaf movement on shedding of rain water by juvenile plants of Machaerium aorboreum (Jacq.) Vogel (Leguminosae), a liana of Panamanian lowland forests. The leaflets have acuminate tips (""driptips""), and exhibit both thigmonasty (movement in response to tacile stimuli) and nyctinasty (diurnal movement patterns). Thigmonasty also occurs in Mimosa pudica L. (Leguminosae), the ""sensitive plant"" (Roblin 1976), and many other tropical legumes The leaflets of Mimosa fold within a few seconds following gentle stimuli. Raindrops initiate thigmonastic responses in other tropical plants (von Denffer et al. 1976). The functional significance of this response has not been determined. Nyctinastic leaves may protect meristematic tissue from frost damage in some high-elevation plants (Smith 1974), but their adaptive significance in low-elevation tropical plants is undear (Darwin 1881, Satter and Galston 1971, Schwintzer 1971). Jungner (1891) was one of the first to regard drip-tips as an adaptation for rapid draining of the leaf surface. He observed that leaves with drip-tips dried more quickly, and were less overgrown with epiphyllae, than leaves without drip-tips. He believed that by facilitating water runoff, drip-tips kept the leaf surface relatively clear of spores of epiphyllae, and soluble substances which might encourage epiphyllae growth. Stahl (1898) showed that by removing the drip-tips he could increase the time required for a leaf to dry, but he doubted there was any correlation between drip-tips and the presence or absence of epiphyllae. He instead proposed that driptips functioned to prevent a lingering surface film of water, which would lower the surface temperature of the leaf, which in turn would slow the rate of transpiration by the plant. A low rate of transpiralPresent address: Department of Zoology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, U.S.A. tion, he reasoned, would slow the uptake of mineral salts by the roots, which would be disadvantageous to the plant. Shreve (1914), working in the understory in the montane forest of Jamaica, was unable to detect any difference in the rate of drying in leaves with driptips removed versus those with drip-tips intact. Richards (1966) maintains that Shreve worked with plants with atypical, abbreviated drip-tips, and that his results do not therefore disprove the hypothesis that drip-tips have a drying function. According to Richards and to Edmisten (1970), the controversy about the ecological significance of drip-tips remains unsolved."	1	Biotropica

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cellular processing are believed to be centrally involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, many physiological functions have been described for APP, including a role in cell-cell- and cell-ECM-adhesion as well as in axonal outgrowth. We show here the molecular determinants of the oligomerization/dimerization of APP, which is central for its cellular (mis)function. Using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering and SEC-coupled static light scattering we demonstrate that the dimerization of APP is energetically induced by a heparin mediated dimerization of the E1 domain, which results in a dimeric interaction of E2. We also show that the acidic domain (AcD) interferes with the dimerization of E1 and propose a model where both, cis- and trans-dimerization occur dependent on cellular localization and function.	0	Journal of structural biology
41	20906907	10.1016/J.JBIOMECH.2017.06.036	20906907	Crouch severity is a poor predictor of elevated oxygen consumption in cerebral palsy.	Children with cerebral palsy (CP) expend more energy to walk compared to typically-developing peers. One of the most prevalent gait patterns among children with CP, crouch gait, is often singled out as especially exhausting. The dynamics of crouch gait increase external flexion moments and the demand on extensor muscles. This elevated demand is thought to dramatically increase energy expenditure. However, the impact of crouch severity on energy expenditure has not been investigated among children with CP. We evaluated oxygen consumption and gait kinematics for 573 children with bilateral CP. The average net nondimensional oxygen consumption during gait of the children with CP (0.18±0.06) was 2.9 times that of speed-matched typically-developing peers. Crouch severity was only modestly related to oxygen consumption, with measures of knee flexion angle during gait explaining only 5-20% of the variability in oxygen consumption. While knee moment and muscle activity were moderately to strongly correlated with crouch severity (r2=0.13-0.73), these variables were only weakly correlated with oxygen consumption (r2=0.02-0.04). Thus, although the dynamics of crouch gait increased muscle demand, these effects did not directly result in elevated energy expenditure. In clinical gait analysis, assumptions about an individual's energy expenditure should not be based upon kinematics or kinetics alone. Identifying patient-specific factors that contribute to increased energy expenditure may provide new pathways to improve gait for children with CP.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Unraveling its hierarchical toughening mechanisms and damage-tolerance design strategies may provide significant inspiration for the pursuit of high-performance artificial armors. In this work, relationships between the structure and mechanical performance of nacre were investigated. The results show that other than their brick-and-mortar structure, individual nacre tablets significantly contribute to the damage localization of nacre. Affected by intracrystalline organics, the tablets exhibit a unique fracture behavior. The synergistic action of the nanoscale deformation mechanisms increases the energy dissipation efficiency of the tablets and contributes to the preservation of the structural and functional integrity of the shell.	0	Journal of structural biology

At the same time, CRT has been characterized as an important stress-response protein capable of inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) when translocated to the cell surface. It remains unclear why CRT expression is preserved by malignant cells during the course of transformation despite its immunogenic properties. In this study, we identify a novel, critical function of CRT as a cell survival factor in multiple types of human solid-tissue malignancies. CRT knockdown activates p53, which mediates cell-death response independent of executioner caspase activity and accompanied full-length poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Mechanistically, we show that down-regulation of CRT results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and induction of mitochondria permeability transition pore (mPTP)-dependent cell death, which can be significantly rescued by the mPTP inhibitor, Cyclosporin A (CsA). The clinical importance of CRT expression was revealed in the analysis of the large cohort of cancer patients (N = 2,058) to demonstrate that high levels of CRT inversely correlates with patient survival. Our study identifies intracellular CRT as an important therapeutic target for tumors whose survival relies on its expression.	0	PLoS biology

We identified 4,246 known species of urban microorganisms and a consistent set of 31 species found in 97% of samples that were distinct from human commensal organisms. Profiles of AMR genes varied widely in type and density across cities. Cities showed distinct microbial taxonomic signatures that were driven by climate and geographic differences. These results constitute a high-resolution global metagenomic atlas that enables discovery of organisms and genes, highlights potential public health and forensic applications, and provides a culture-independent view of AMR burden in cities.	0	Cell

Foot placement is critical to balance control during walking and is primarily controlled by muscle force generation. Although gluteus medius activity has been associated with mediolateral foot placement, how other muscles contribute to foot placement is not clear. Furthermore, although dynamic walking models have suggested that anteroposterior foot placement can be passively controlled, the extent to which muscles actively contribute to anteroposterior foot placement has not been determined. The objective of this study was to identify individual muscle contributions to mediolateral and anteroposterior foot placement during walking in healthy adults. Dynamic simulations of walking were developed for six older adults and a segmental power analysis was performed to determine the individual muscle contributions to the mediolateral and anteroposterior power delivered to the foot segment. The simulations revealed the ipsilateral swing limb gluteus medius, iliopsoas, rectus femoris and hamstrings and the contralateral stance limb gluteus medius and ankle plantarflexors were primary contributors to both mediolateral and anteroposterior foot placement. Muscle contributions to foot placement were found to be highly influenced by their contributions to pelvis power, which was dominated by those muscles crossing the hip joint. Thus, impaired balance control may be improved by focusing rehabilitation interventions on optimizing the coordination of those muscles crossing the hip joint and the ankle plantarflexors.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Proteins of the inter-rod sheath and peptides within the narrow inter-crystallite space of the rod structure are considered largely responsible for visco-elastic and visco-plastic properties of enamel. The present study was designed to investigate putative peptides of the inter-crystallite space. Entities of 1-6 kDa extracted from enamel rods of erupted permanent teeth were analysed by mass spectrometry (MS) and shown to comprise N-terminal amelogenin (AMEL) peptides either containing or not containing exon 4 product. Other dominant entities consisted of an N-terminal peptide from ameloblastin (AMBN) and a series of the most hydrophobic peptides from serum albumin (ALBN). Amelogenin peptides encoded by the Y-chromosome allele were strongly detected in Enamel from male teeth. Location of N-terminal AMEL peptides as well as AMBN and ALBN, between apatite crystallites, was disclosed by immunogold scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density plots confirmed the relative abundance of these products including exon 4+ AMEL peptides that have greater capacity for binding to hydroxyapatite. Hydrophilic X and Y peptides encoded in exon 4 differ only in substitution of non-polar isoleucine in Y for polar threonine in X with reduced disruption of the hydrophobic N-terminal structure in the Y form. Despite similarity of X and Y alleles of AMEL the non-coding region upstream from exon 4 shows significant variation with implications for segregation of processing of transcripts from exon 4. Detection of fragments from multiple additional proteins including keratins (KER), fetuin A (FETUA), proteinases and proteinase inhibitors, likely reflect biochemical events during enamel formation.	0	Journal of structural biology

Schwann cells in developing nerves depend on extrinsic signals from the axon and from the extracellular matrix to first sort and ensheathe a single axon and then myelinate it. Neuregulin 1 type III (Nrg1III) and laminin α2β1γ1 (Lm211) are the key axonal and matrix signals, respectively, but how their signaling is integrated and if each molecule controls both axonal sorting and myelination is unclear. Here, we use a series of epistasis experiments to show that Lm211 modulates neuregulin signaling to ensure the correct timing and amount of myelination. Lm211 can inhibit Nrg1III by limiting protein kinase A (PKA) activation, which is required to initiate myelination. We provide evidence that excessive PKA activation amplifies promyelinating signals downstream of neuregulin, including direct activation of the neuregulin receptor ErbB2 and its effector Grb2-Associated Binder-1 (Gab1), thereby elevating the expression of the key transcription factors Oct6 and early growth response protein 2 (Egr2). The inhibitory effect of Lm211 is seen only in fibers of small caliber. These data may explain why hereditary neuropathies associated with decreased laminin function are characterized by focally thick and redundant myelin.	0	PLoS biology
48	31381395	10.1126/SCIENCE.289.5487.2114	31381395	How snapping shrimp snap: through cavitating bubbles.	The snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) produces a loud snapping sound by an extremely rapid closure of its snapper claw. One of the effects of the snapping is to stun or kill prey animals. During the rapid snapper claw closure, a high-velocity water jet is emitted from the claw with a speed exceeding cavitation conditions. Hydrophone measurements in conjunction with time-controlled high-speed imaging of the claw closure demonstrate that the sound is emitted at the cavitation bubble collapse and not on claw closure. A model for the bubble dynamics based on a Rayleigh-Plesset-type equation quantitatively accounts for the time dependence of the bubble radius and for the emitted sound.	1	Science

In cells, histone chaperone Asf1 is essential for H3K56 acetylation, yet the mechanisms for H3K56 specificity and Asf1 requirement remain unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of the Rtt109-Asf1-H3-H4 complex and found that unwinding of histone H3 αN, where K56 is normally located, and stabilization of the very C-terminal β strand of histone H4 by Asf1 are prerequisites for H3K56 acetylation. Unexpectedly, an interaction between Rtt109 and the central helix of histone H3 is also required. The observed multiprotein, multisite substrate recognition mechanism among histone modification enzymes provides mechanistic understandings of Rtt109 and Asf1 in H3K56 acetylation, as well as valuable insights into substrate recognition by histone modification enzymes in general.	0	Cell

At the base of the trigger hair, mechanosensation is transduced into an all-or-nothing action potential (AP) that spreads all over the trap, ultimately leading to trap closure and prey capture. To reveal the molecular basis for the unique functional repertoire of this mechanoresponsive plant structure, we determined the transcriptome of D. muscipula’s trigger hair. Among the genes that were found to be highly specific to the trigger hair, the Shaker-type channel KDM1 was electrophysiologically characterized as a hyperpolarization- and acid-activated K+-selective channel, thus allowing the reuptake of K+ ions into the trigger hair’s sensory cells during the hyperpolarization phase of the AP. During trap development, the increased electrical excitability of the trigger hair is associated with the transcriptional induction of KDM1. Conversely, when KDM1 is blocked by Cs+ in adult traps, the initiation of APs in response to trigger hair deflection is reduced, and trap closure is suppressed. KDM1 thus plays a dominant role in K+ homeostasis in the context of AP and turgor formation underlying the mechanosensation of trigger hair cells and thus D. muscipula’s hapto-electric signaling.	0	PLoS biology

The context specificity of AHR target genes has so far impeded systematic investigation of AHR activity and its upstream enzymes across human cancers. A pan-tissue AHR signature, derived by natural language processing, revealed that across 32 tumor entities, interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4I1) associates more frequently with AHR activity than IDO1 or TDO2, hitherto recognized as the main Trp-catabolic enzymes. IL4I1 activates the AHR through the generation of indole metabolites and kynurenic acid. It associates with reduced survival in glioma patients, promotes cancer cell motility, and suppresses adaptive immunity, thereby enhancing the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in mice. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) induces IDO1 and IL4I1. As IDO1 inhibitors do not block IL4I1, IL4I1 may explain the failure of clinical studies combining ICB with IDO1 inhibition. Taken together, IL4I1 blockade opens new avenues for cancer therapy.	0	Cell
52	757231	10.1016/J.JBIOMECH.2017.12.001	757231	Validation of lumbar spine loading from a musculoskeletal model including the lower limbs and lumbar spine.	Low back mechanics are important to quantify to study injury, pain and disability. As in vivo forces are difficult to measure directly, modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate these forces. Validation of model estimates is critical to gain confidence in modeling results across populations of interest, such as people with lower-limb amputation. Motion capture, ground reaction force and electromyographic data were collected from ten participants without an amputation (five male/five female) and five participants with a unilateral transtibial amputation (four male/one female) during trunk-pelvis range of motion trials in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. A musculoskeletal model with a detailed lumbar spine and the legs including 294 muscles was used to predict L4-L5 loading and muscle activations using static optimization. Model estimates of L4-L5 intervertebral joint loading were compared to measured intradiscal pressures from the literature and muscle activations were compared to electromyographic signals. Model loading estimates were only significantly different from experimental measurements during trunk extension for males without an amputation and for people with an amputation, which may suggest a greater portion of L4-L5 axial load transfer through the facet joints, as facet loads are not captured by intradiscal pressure transducers. Pressure estimates between the model and previous work were not significantly different for flexion, lateral bending or axial rotation. Timing of model-estimated muscle activations compared well with electromyographic activity of the lumbar paraspinals and upper erector spinae. Validated estimates of low back loading can increase the applicability of musculoskeletal models to clinical diagnosis and treatment.	0	Journal of biomechanics
53	53060421	10.1002/GRL.50710	53060421	Landscape‐scale carbon storage associated with beaver dams	[1] Beaver meadows form when beaver dams promote prolonged overbank flooding and floodplain retention of sediment and organic matter. Extensive beaver meadows form in broad, low-gradient valley segments upstream from glacial terminal moraines. Surveyed sediment volume and total organic carbon content in beaver meadows on the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park are extrapolated to create a first-order approximation of landscape-scale carbon storage in these meadows relative to adjacent uplands. Differences in total organic carbon between abandoned and active beaver meadows suggest that valley-bottom carbon storage has declined substantially as beaver have disappeared and meadows have dried. Relict beaver meadows represent ~8% of total carbon storage within the landscape, but the value was closer to 23% when beaver actively maintained wet meadows. These changes reflect the general magnitude of cumulative effects in heterotrophic respiration and organic matter oxidation associated with historical declines in beaver populations across the continent.	1	Geophysical Research Letters

The aim of this work is to underline the biological significance of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in ectothermic fish using the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) as an experimental model. A contig of 1,990 bp in length was recognized as a UCP1 ortholog after initial searches in the gilthead sea bream AQUAFIRST database (http://www.sigenae.org/aquafirst). Additional searches were performed in skeletal muscle by RT-PCR, and the amplified PCR product was recognized as UCP3 after sequence completion by 5′- and 3′RACE. UCP1 expression was mostly detected in liver, whereas UCP3 transcripts were only found in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres (white skeletal muscle > red skeletal muscle > heart). Specific gene regulation of UCP1 (liver) and UCP3 (white skeletal muscle) was addressed in physiological models of age, seasonal growth and energy-metabolic unbalances. Both the increase in energy demand (stress confinement) and the reduction in energy supply during adaptive cold response in winter down-regulated UCP1 expression. Conversely, transcript levels of UCP3 were higher with age, seasonal fattening and dietary deficiencies in essential fatty acids leading to the increase in fatty acid flux towards the muscle. This close association between UCP1 and UCP3 with the oxidative and metabolic tissue status is perhaps directly related to the ancestral protein UCP function, and allows the use of UCPs as lipotoxicity markers in ectothermic fish.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are key players in this process and perceive the occurrence of nonself-activities or foreign molecules. In plants, coevolution with a variety of pests and pathogens has resulted in repertoires of several hundred diverse NLRs in single individuals and many more in populations as a whole. However, the mechanism by which defense signaling is triggered by these NLRs in plants is poorly understood. Here, we show that upon pathogen perception, NLRs use their N-terminal domains to transactivate other receptors. Their N-terminal domains homo- and heterodimerize, suggesting that plant NLRs oligomerize upon activation, similar to the vertebrate NLRs; however, consistent with their large number in plants, the complexes are highly heterometric. Also, in contrast to metazoan NLRs, the N-terminus, rather than their centrally located nucleotide-binding (NB) domain, can mediate initial partner selection. The highly redundant network of NLR interactions in plants is proposed to provide resilience to perturbation by pathogens.	0	PLoS biology
56	227135262	10.1016/J.JBIOMECH.2020.110122	227135262	The effects of exterior boundary conditions on a internally heated tumor tissue with a thermoporoelastic model.	Modeling flow field in tumor regions interstitial space is of primary importance, because of the importance of advection in macromolecule drug delivery. Its deformation has also to be taken into account because of the forces caused by the fluid; if the tumor region is not isothermal, this deformation can be also strongly affected by temperature fields. In this paper, the effects of thermal boundary conditions on a tumor region periphery with an internal heat source are investigated. The tumor region is modeled as a deformable sphere, in which two phases can be distinguished. The fluid phase is the interstitial fluid, while the rest of the tumor is modeled as the solid phase, including also capillaries and tissues. Transient-state governing equations for mass, momentum and energy are written for both phases, by also considering tumor deformation under the linear elastic material assumption. A situation of Tumor Blood Flow (TBF) rapid decay, in which vascular pressure rapidly approaches to zero, is considered, while the heat source is modeled as a fourth-grade radial-decay function. Boundary conditions for the energy equation are varied on the external surface of the sphere, in order to appreciate the effects of the surrounding on flow and temperature fields inside the tumor. After scaling equations, a finite-element scheme is employed for the numerical solution. Comparisons with analytical solutions from literature show a good agreement. Results are shown for different dimensionless parameters that are referred to temperature, volumetric strain, pressure and velocity, showing in which case external boundary conditions strongly affect tumor region flow fields and a third-kind boundary condition is needed.	0	Journal of biomechanics
57	17677492	10.1007/S00360-012-0689-0	17677492	Changes in diet, body mass and fatty acid composition during pre-hibernation in a subtropical bat in relation to NPY and AgRP expression	Prior to hibernation, mammals accumulate large amounts of fat in their bodies. In temperate mammalian species, hibernation is improved by increasing the levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the body. The saturation of fatty acids (FA) in both white adipose tissue (WAT) and membrane phospholipids of mammals often reflects their diet composition. We found that the greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum) accumulates large amounts of fat at the end of summer by gradually shifting to a fat-rich diet (queen carpenter ants, Camponotus felah). PUFA are almost absent in this diet (<1 % of total FA), which contains a high fraction of saturated (SFA) and mono-unsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids. We found similar low levels of PUFA in mouse-tailed bat WAT, but not in their heart total lipids. The expression of two appetite-stimulating (orexigenic) hypothalamic neuropeptides, AgRP and NPY, increased in parallel to the shift in diet and with fat gain in these bats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only documented example of specific pre-hibernation diet in bats, and one which reveals the most saturated FA composition ever documented in a mammal. We suggest that the increase in expression levels of NPY and AgRP may contribute to the observed diet shift and mass gain, and that the FA composition of the bat’s specialized diet is adaptive in the relatively high temperatures we recorded in both their winter and summer roosts.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

The common ancestral population radiated rapidly from just one of the two early branches that contributed to Native Americans today. We document two previously unappreciated streams of gene flow between North and South America. One affected the Central Andes by ∼4,200 years ago, while the other explains an affinity between the oldest North American genome associated with the Clovis culture and the oldest Central and South Americans from Chile, Brazil, and Belize. However, this was not the primary source for later South Americans, as the other ancient individuals derive from lineages without specific affinity to the Clovis-associated genome, suggesting a population replacement that began at least 9,000 years ago and was followed by substantial population continuity in multiple regions.	0	Cell

However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.	0	PLoS biology

"	We showed how super-organisms, here ant colonies, modify their home according to their increasing or decreasing space requirements. The ontogeny of wall building by colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis involves discontinuous rebuilding events that are reminiscent of moulting in insects. Here for the first time we manipulated worker density by changing nest cavity size instead of worker number, thus avoiding accidentally shifting the balance of workers with different propensities for building tasks. Our results suggest for the first time that history influences wall building in ants when worker density decreases (e.g. with colony diminution) as well as when it increases (e.g. with colony growth) as shown by earlier work. Furthermore, we found that ants used a greater number of the larger building blocks (big sand grains) both after cavity expansion and, more surprisingly, also after cavity contraction. The pattern of nest ‘moulting’ we experimentally manipulated and analysed should provide insights into possible trade-offs between the various functions and structural properties of the nest that these animals may have to optimize.	1	Animal Behaviour
61	17679109	10.1242/JEB.034991	17679109	Ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure facilitate deep dives and cold water foraging in adult leatherback sea turtles	SUMMARY Adult leatherbacks are large animals (300–500 kg), overlapping in size with marine pinniped and cetacean species. Unlike marine mammals, they start their aquatic life as 40–50 g hatchlings, so undergo a 10,000-fold increase in body mass during independent existence. Hatchlings are limited to the tropics and near-surface water. Adults, obligate predators on gelatinous plankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and are gigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water. This study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure related to diving and exposure to cold. Hatchling leatherbacks have a conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous rings interspersed with extensive connective tissue. The adult trachea is an almost continuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates, and will collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives, thus avoiding pressure-related structural and physiological problems. It is lined with an extensive, dense erectile vascular plexus that will warm and humidify cold inspired air and possibly retain heat on expiration. A sub-luminal lymphatic plexus is also present. Mammals and birds have independently evolved nasal turbinates to fulfil such a respiratory thermocontrol function; for them, turbinates are regarded as diagnostic of endothermy. This is the first demonstration of a turbinate equivalent in a living reptile.	1	The Journal of Experimental Biology

While tremendous progress has been made in the identification of protein complexes, their assembly and dynamics remain difficult to characterize. Here, we present a high-throughput strategy to analyze the native assembly kinetics of protein complexes. We apply our approach to characterize the co-assembly for 320 pairs of nucleoporins (NUPs) constituting the ≈50 MDa nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast. Some NUPs co-assemble fast via rapid exchange whereas others require lengthy maturation steps. This reveals a hierarchical principle of NPC biogenesis where individual subcomplexes form on a minute timescale and then co-assemble from center to periphery in a ∼1 h-long maturation process. Intriguingly, the NUP Mlp1 stands out as joining very late and associating preferentially with aged NPCs. Our approach is readily applicable beyond the NPC, making it possible to analyze the intracellular dynamics of a variety of multiprotein assemblies.	0	Cell

The aim of this study was to examine the mechanical behavior of the colon using tensile tests under different loading speeds. Specimens were taken from different locations of the colonic frame from refrigerated cadavers. The specimens were submitted to uniaxial tensile tests after preconditioning using a dynamic load (1 m/s), intermediate load (10 cm/s), and quasi-static load (1 cm/s). A total of 336 specimens taken from 28 colons were tested. The stress-strain analysis for longitudinal specimens indicated a Young's modulus of 3.17 ± 2.05 MPa under dynamic loading (1 m/s), 1.74 ± 1.15 MPa under intermediate loading (10 cm/s), and 1.76 ± 1.21 MPa under quasi-static loading (1 cm/s) with p < 0.001. For the circumferential specimen, the stress-strain curves indicated a Young's modulus of 3.15 ± 1.73 MPa under dynamic loading (1 m/s), 2.14 ± 1.3 MPa under intermediate loading (10 cm/s), and 0.63 ± 1.25 MPa under quasi-static loading (1 cm/s) with p < 0.001. The curves reveal two types of behaviors of the colon: fast break behavior at high speed traction (1 m/s) and a lower break behavior for lower speeds (10 cm/s and 1 cm/s). The circumferential orientation required greater levels of stress and strain to obtain lesions than the longitudinal orientation. The presence of taeniae coli changed the mechanical response during low-speed loading. Colonic mechanical behavior varies with loading speeds with two different types of mechanical behavior: more fragile behavior under dynamic load and more elastic behavior for quasi-static load.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Here, we show that TBL1XR1 mutations skew the humoral immune response toward generating abnormal immature memory B cells (MB), while impairing plasma cell differentiation. At the molecular level, TBL1XR1 mutants co-opt SMRT/HDAC3 repressor complexes toward binding the MB cell transcription factor (TF) BACH2 at the expense of the germinal center (GC) TF BCL6, leading to pre-memory transcriptional reprogramming and cell-fate bias. Upon antigen recall, TBL1XR1 mutant MB cells fail to differentiate into plasma cells and instead preferentially reenter new GC reactions, providing evidence for a cyclic reentry lymphomagenesis mechanism. Ultimately, TBL1XR1 alterations lead to a striking extranodal immunoblastic lymphoma phenotype that mimics the human disease. Both human and murine lymphomas feature expanded MB-like cell populations, consistent with a MB-cell origin and delineating an unforeseen pathway for malignant transformation of the immune system.	0	Cell
65	4425287	10.1038/NATURE03661	4425287	Extracellular electron transfer via microbial nanowires	Microbes that can transfer electrons to extracellular electron acceptors, such as Fe(iii) oxides, are important in organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling in soils and sediments. Previous investigations on electron transfer to Fe(iii) have focused on the role of outer-membrane c-type cytochromes. However, some Fe(iii) reducers lack c-cytochromes. Geobacter species, which are the predominant Fe(iii) reducers in many environments, must directly contact Fe(iii) oxides to reduce them, and produce monolateral pili that were proposed, on the basis of the role of pili in other organisms, to aid in establishing contact with the Fe(iii) oxides. Here we report that a pilus-deficient mutant of Geobacter sulfurreducens could not reduce Fe(iii) oxides but could attach to them. Conducting-probe atomic force microscopy revealed that the pili were highly conductive. These results indicate that the pili of G. sulfurreducens might serve as biological nanowires, transferring electrons from the cell surface to the surface of Fe(iii) oxides. Electron transfer through pili indicates possibilities for other unique cell-surface and cell–cell interactions, and for bioengineering of novel conductive materials.	1	Nature

Not only are there many such interactions, but any given interaction of each individual with, say, its neighbor or a nutrient could lead to a different effect on its fitness and on the dynamics of the population of which it is a member. Predicting those effects is an enduring challenge to the field of ecology. Using a simple laboratory system, Hoek and colleagues present evidence that resource availability can be a primary driver of variation between interactions. Their results suggest that a complex continuum of interaction outcomes can result from the simple combined effects of nutrient availability and density-dependent population dynamics. The future is rich with potential to integrate tractable experimental systems like theirs with hypotheses derived from studies of interactions in natural communities.	0	PLoS biology

This limitation is due to the physical thermodynamic properties of the photon-detecting opsins. However, the detection of naturally invisible near-infrared (NIR) light is a desirable ability. To break this limitation, we developed ocular injectable photoreceptor-binding upconversion nanoparticles (pbUCNPs). These nanoparticles anchored on retinal photoreceptors as miniature NIR light transducers to create NIR light image vision with negligible side effects. Based on single-photoreceptor recordings, electroretinograms, cortical recordings, and visual behavioral tests, we demonstrated that mice with these nanoantennae could not only perceive NIR light, but also see NIR light patterns. Excitingly, the injected mice were also able to differentiate sophisticated NIR shape patterns. Moreover, the NIR light pattern vision was ambient-daylight compatible and existed in parallel with native daylight vision. This new method will provide unmatched opportunities for a wide variety of emerging bio-integrated nanodevice designs and applications. VIDEO ABSTRACT.	0	Cell

While mitochondria play critical roles in ATP level regulation, we still lack a systematic and quantitative picture of how individual mitochondrial-related genes contribute to cellular ATP level and how dysregulated ATP levels may affect downstream cellular processes. Advances in genetically encoded ATP biosensors have provided new opportunities for addressing these issues. ATP biosensors allow researchers to quantify the changes of ATP levels in real time at the single-cell level and characterize corresponding effects at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. Along this direction, several recent single-cell studies using ATP biosensors, including the work by Mendelsohn and colleagues, have started to uncover the principles for how genetic and nongenetic parameters may modulate ATP levels to affect cellular functions and human health.	0	PLoS biology

A semi-automated protocol has been developed for rotational data collection of electron diffraction patterns by combined use of SerialEM and ParallEM, where SerialEM is used for positioning of sample crystals and ParallEM for rotational data collection. ParallEM calls standard camera control software through an AutoIt script, which adapts to software operational changes and to new GUI programs guiding other cameras. Development included periodic flashing and pausing of data collection during overnight or day-long recording with a cold field-emission beam. The protocol proved to be efficient and accurate in data collection of large-scale rotational series from two JEOL electron microscopes, a general-purpose JEM-2100 and a high-end CRYO ARM 300. Efficiency resulted from simpler steps and task specialization. It is possible to collect 12-20 rotational series from ∼ -68° to ∼ 68° at a rotation speed of 1° /s in one hour without human supervision.	0	Journal of structural biology

Resolving the 3D architecture of cells to atomic resolution is one of the most ambitious challenges of cellular and structural biology. Central to this process is the ability to automate tomogram segmentation to identify sub-cellular components, facilitate molecular docking and annotate detected objects with associated metadata. Here we demonstrate that RAZA (Rapid 3D z-crossings algorithm) provides a robust, accurate, intuitive, fast, and generally applicable segmentation algorithm capable of detecting organelles, membranes, macromolecular assemblies and extrinsic membrane protein domains. RAZA defines each continuous contour within a tomogram as a discrete object and extracts a set of 3D structural fingerprints (major, middle and minor axes, surface area and volume), enabling selective, semi-automated segmentation and object extraction. RAZA takes advantage of the fact that the underlying algorithm is a true 3D edge detector, allowing the axes of a detected object to be defined, independent of its random orientation within a cellular tomogram. The selectivity of object segmentation and extraction can be controlled by specifying a user-defined detection tolerance threshold for each fingerprint parameter, within which segmented objects must fall and/or by altering the number of search parameters, to define morphologically similar structures. We demonstrate the capability of RAZA to selectively extract subgroups of organelles (mitochondria) and macromolecular assemblies (ribosomes) from cellular tomograms. Furthermore, the ability of RAZA to define objects and their contours, provides a basis for molecular docking and rapid tomogram annotation.	0	Journal of structural biology

Dynamical phenomena in the postural chain occur before, during and after the voluntary movement. These phenomena correspond to anticipatory (APA), simultaneous (SPA), and consecutive (CPA) postural adjustments, respectively. APA and, more recently, CPA, have been extensively investigated in the literature. SPA have surprisingly received much less attention. The aim of the present study was to examine the role(s) of SPA associated with a single step task (SST). Ten healthy young adults performed series of SST on a force-plate. A 2-DOF mechanical model was used to separate the dynamics of the swing leg and the dynamics of the rest of the body, corresponding to the focal and the postural component of the SST, respectively. The postural component was plotted against the focal one during SPA (from heel-off to foot-contact), and this plot was modelled as a Lissajous ellipse. Result showed that this ellipse systematically ran through the same three quadrants of the diagram. For each of these quadrants, the role of the postural component in regards to the focal one was interpreted according to the relative orientation of the postural and focal dynamics. Results thus showed that SPA ensured the following successive roles: counter-perturbation of swing leg dynamics following heel-off, propulsion of swing leg, counter-perturbation of swing leg dynamics again, and then braking swing leg movement. These new findings contribute to a better knowledge of postural adjustments properties, and may provide new insights for understanding balance troubles with aging and in neurological patients (e.g. people with Parkinson's disease).	0	Journal of biomechanics

To gain insight into the general principles that govern how transcription factors regulate cell-type diversity, we used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the extensive cellular diversity in the Drosophila optic lobes. We sequenced 55,000 single cells and assigned them to 52 clusters. We validated and annotated many clusters using RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted single-cell types and cluster-specific genes. To identify transcription factors responsible for inducing specific terminal differentiation features, we generated a ""random forest"" model, and we showed that the transcription factors Apterous and Traffic-jam are required in many but not all cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. In fact, the same terminal characters often can be regulated by different transcription factors in different cell types, arguing for extensive phenotypic convergence. Our data provide a deep understanding of the developmental and functional specification of a complex brain structure."	0	Cell

The increase in the number of large multi-component complexes and membrane protein crystal structures determined over the last few years can be ascribed to a number of factors such as better protein expression and purification systems, the emergence of high-throughput crystallization techniques and the advent of 3rd generation synchrotron sources. However, many systems tend to produce crystals that can be extremely heterogeneous in their diffraction properties. This prevents, in many cases, the collection of diffraction data of sufficient quality to yield useful biological or phase information. Techniques that can increase the diffraction quality of macromolecular crystals can therefore be essential in the successful conclusion of these challenging projects. No technique is universal but encouraging results have been recently achieved by carrying out the controlled dehydration of crystals of biological macromolecules. A new device that delivers a stream of air with a precisely controlled relative humidity to the complicated sample environment found at modern synchrotron beamlines has been conceived at the EMBL Grenoble and developed by the EMBL and the ESRF as part of the SPINE2 complexes project, a European Commission funded protein structure initiative. The device, the HC1b, has been available for three years at the ESRF macromolecular crystallography beamlines and many systems have benefitted from on-line controlled dehydration. Here we describe a standard dehydration experiment, highlight some successful cases and discuss the different possible uses of the device.	0	Journal of structural biology

It is, therefore, important to understand their physiological mechanisms of low-temperature survival. Acclimation to moderate–low temperature can improve cold tolerance, and pre-acclimation to mild desiccation can also improve survival of a subsequent cold exposure. However, very few studies have assessed the combined actions of cold and drought acclimations. In the present study, we combined cold acclimation with drought acclimation making it possible to assess the interactions between effects of these two stressors using the springtail Protaphorura fimata as a model organism. We investigated the interacting effects of drought and cold acclimation on body fluid osmolality, membrane phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, and cold-shock tolerance. Acclimation to mild drought (− 2.46 MPa) increased body fluid osmolality from 0.33 to 1.25 Osm at all acclimation temperatures (5, 10, 15, or 20 °C) likely due to accumulation of the compatible osmolytes, trehalose, and alanine. Interestingly, the expected positive effect of drought acclimation on cold-shock tolerance was only evident at high acclimation temperature (20 °C), whereas at intermediate temperatures (10 and 15 °C), there was an interaction between acclimation temperature and drought. At 5 °C, no effect of drought acclimation on cold-shock tolerance was observed despite high osmolality. The positive effect of drought acclimation at 20 °C on subsequent cold-shock survival coincided with a drought-induced effect on PLFA composition only detectable at high temperature. We discuss the possible roles of drought-induced compatible osmolytes and an altered PLFA composition in the cold-shock tolerance of arthropods.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

The structure and dimensions are given for the rete mirabile. It is interpreted as a counter current diffusion exchange mechanism between the afferent and efferent rete.2. This diffusion exchange has been quantitatively evaluated for O2, CO2, and N2. The arrangement makes possible the maintenance of a steep tension gradient within the rete, so that the oxygen loss from the leaving blood can be extremely low.3. Quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the rete diffusion makes it clear that the limiting equilibrium pressure in the swimbladder could be extremely high, and that the limiting factor lies mainly in the dissociation pressure of the chemical or physical reaction which ultimately splits off the oxygen.4. The nature of the responsible compound and reaction is unknown. The anatomical arrangement of the glandular structure and the rete is suggestive of a cellular secretion of oxygen rather than of a mechanism that splits off oxygen in the blood.5.

77	220715233	10.1016/J.CUB.2020.07.007	220715233	Dynamic, Non-binary Specification of Sexual State in the C. elegans Nervous System	Biological sex in animals is often considered a fixed, individual-level characteristic. However, not all sex-specific features are static: for example, C. elegans males (XO) can sometimes exhibit hermaphrodite (XX)-like feeding behavior [1, 2]. (C. elegans hermaphrodites are somatic females that transiently produce self-sperm.) Essentially all somatic sex differences in C. elegans are governed by the master regulator tra-1, whose activity is controlled by chromosomal sex and is necessary and sufficient to specify the hermaphrodite state [3]. One aspect of this state is high expression of the chemoreceptor odr-10. In hermaphrodites, high odr-10 expression promotes feeding, but in males, low odr-10 expression facilitates exploration [4]. However, males suppress this sex difference in two contexts: juvenile males exhibit high odr-10 expression and food deprivation activates odr-10 in adult males [4-6]. Remarkably, we find that both of these phenomena require tra-1. In juvenile (L3) males, tra-1 is expressed in numerous neurons; this expression diminishes as individuals mature into adulthood, a process that requires conserved regulators of sexual maturation. tra-1 remains expressed in a small number of neurons in adult males, where it likely has a permissive role in odr-10 activation. Thus, the neuronal functions of tra-1 are not limited to hermaphrodites; rather, tra-1 also acts in the male nervous system to transiently suppress a sexual dimorphism, developmentally and in response to nutritional stress. Our results show that the molecular and functional representation of sexual state in C. elegans is neither static nor homogeneous, challenging traditional notions about the nature of biological sex.	1	Current Biology

Here, a semi-automated particle selection procedure is presented that has been implemented within the open-source software RELION. At the heart of the procedure lies a fully CTF-corrected template-based picking algorithm, which is supplemented by a fast sorting algorithm and reference-free 2D class averaging to remove false positives. With only limited user-interaction, the proposed procedure yields results that are comparable to manual particle selection. Together with an improved graphical user interface, these developments further contribute to turning RELION from a stand-alone refinement program into a convenient image processing pipeline for the entire single-particle approach.	0	Journal of structural biology

Modeling human-object interactions is a necessary step in the ergonomic assessment of products. Fingertip finite element models can help investigating these interactions, if they are built based on realistic geometrical data and material properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the fingertip geometry and its mechanical response under compression, and to identify the parameters of a hyperelastic material property associated to the fingertip soft tissues. Fingertip compression tests in an MRI device were performed on 5 subjects at either 2 or 4 N and at 15° or 50°. The MRI images allowed to document both the internal and external fingertip dimensions and to build 5 subject-specific finite element models. Simulations reproducing the fingertip compression tests were run to obtain the material property parameters of the soft tissues. Results indicated that two ellipses in the sagittal and longitudinal plane could describe the external fingertip geometry. The internal geometries indicated an averaged maximal thickness of soft tissues of 6.4 ± 0.8 mm and a 4 ± 1 mm height for the phalanx bone. The averaged deflections under loading went from 1.8 ± 0.3 mm at 2 N, 50° to 3.1 ± 0.2 mm at 4 N, 15°. Finally, the following set of parameters for a second order hyperelastic law to model the fingertip soft tissues was proposed: C01=0.59 ± 0.09 kPa and C20 = 2.65 ± 0.88 kPa. These data should facilitate further efforts on fingertip finite element modeling.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Because predators can be labelled with chemical cues from prey, we questioned if club cell density could be controlled indirectly by predators releasing prey cues. In particular, we suspected a possible feedback mechanism between chemical alarm signals and their cellular source. We raised crucian carp singly and in groups of four. For both rearing types, fish were exposed to skin extracts of either conspecifics or brown trout (without club cells), and provided either low or high food rations. Independent of rearing type, condition factor and club cell density increased with food ration size, but no change was found in club cell density following exposure to conspecific alarm signals. However, the density of club cells was found significantly higher for fish raised in groups than for fish raised alone. We conclude that an increased condition factor results in more club cells, but crucian carp may also possess an awareness of conspecific presence, given by higher club cell densities when raised in groups. This increase in club cell density may be induced by unknown chemical factors released by conspecifics.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

We also examined ultrastructural differences with electron microscopy. In tissues from smooth dogfish, net force (per cross-sectional area) and measures of the speeds of contraction and relaxation were all higher in atrial than ventricular myocardium at both temperatures. Atrial-ventricular differences were evident in the other two species primarily in measures of the rates of contraction and relaxation. Ryanodine-thapsigargin treatment reduced net force and its maximum positive first derivative (i.e., contractility), and increased time to 50 % relaxation in atrial tissue from smooth dogfish at 30 °C. It also increased times to peak force and half relaxation in clearnose skate atrial and ventricular tissue at both temperatures, but only in atrial tissue from sandbar shark at 30 °C; indicating that SR involvement in excitation–contraction (EC) coupling is species- and temperature-specific in elasmobranch fishes, as it is in teleost fishes. Atrial and ventricular myocardium from all three species displayed a negative force–frequency relationship, but there was no evidence that SR involvement in EC coupling was influenced by heart rate. SR was evident in electron micrographs, generally located in proximity to mitochondria and intercalated discs, and to a lesser extent between the myofibrils; with mitochondria being more numerous in ventricular than atrial myocardium in all three species.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

Incorporating the intrinsic variability of heart contractility varying with heart rate into the mathematical model of human heart would be useful for addressing the dynamical behaviors of human cardiovascular system, but models with such features were rarely reported. This study focused on the development and evaluation of a mathematical model of the whole heart, including the effects of heart contractility varying with heart rate changes. This model was developed based on a paradigm and model presented by Ottesen and Densielsen, which was used to model ventricular contraction. A piece-wise function together with expressions for time-related parameters were constructed for modeling atrial contraction. Atrial and ventricular parts of the whole heart model were evaluated by comparing with models from literature, and then the whole heart model were assessed through coupling with a simple model of the systemic circulation system and the pulmonary circulation system. The results indicated that both atrial and ventricular parts of the whole heart model could reasonably reflect their contractility varying with heart rate changes, and the whole heart model could exhibit major features of human heart. Results of the parameters variation studies revealed the correlations between the parameters in the whole heart model and performances (including the maximum pressure and the stroke volume) of every chamber. These results would be useful for helping users to adjust parameters in special applications.	0	Journal of biomechanics

To this end, we analysed snapdragon flowers (Antirrhinum majus), including the mixta and nivea mutants, in controlled laboratory conditions using psychophysical tests with bumblebees. The MIXTA locus controls petal epidermal cell shape, and thus the path that incident light takes within the pigment-containing cells. The effect is that mixta mutant flowers are pink in comparison to the wild type purple flowers, and mutants lack the sparkling sheen of wild type flowers that is clearly visible to human observers. Despite their fundamentally different appearance to humans, and even though bees could discriminate the flowers, inexperienced bees exhibited no preference for either type, and the flowers did not differ in their detectability in a Y-maze—either when the flowers appeared in front of a homogeneous or a dappled background. Equally counterintuitive effects were found for the non-pigmented, UV reflecting nivea mutant: even though the overall reflectance intensity and UV signal of nivea flowers is several times that of wild type flowers, their detectability was significantly reduced relative to wild type flowers. In addition, naïve foragers preferred wild type flowers over nivea mutants, even though these generated a stronger signal in all receptor types. Our results show that single mutations affecting flower signal can have profound effects on pollinator behaviour—but not in ways predictable by crude assessments via human perception, nor simple quantification of UV signals. However, current models of bee visual perception predict the observed effects very well.	1	Arthropod-plant Interactions
84	25515975	10.1007/S00359-017-1194-4	25515975	Variations of cocoon external lipids during wolf spiderlings’ development	This study presents the first characterisation of the silk lipids of the cocoons of a wolf spider (Pardosa saltans). Wolf spiders’ maternal behaviour is complex and involves guarding a cocoon for several weeks, and so cocoons must emit cues to ensure their care and the development of juveniles. We investigated cues associated with the cocoon silk. We assessed qualitative changes of the lipid contents and the composition of cocoon silk in relation to the development of P. saltans wolf spider juveniles. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of P. saltans’ cocoon silk revealed 62 different lipid compounds. The compounds were aliphatic alcohols, glycerides, fatty acids and their methylesters containing 13–29 carbon atoms. We reveal for the first time the presence of ethanolamides and phytosterol on cocoon silk. Qualitative and quantitative changes occur during the embryonic period, as some polar compounds, such as diglycerides and ethanolamides, disappeared while hydrocarbons emerge, and fatty acids disappeared later during the post-embryonic period. Qualitative and/or quantitative changes could play a role in tactochemical communication between mothers and their cocoon. However, mothers do not modify their behaviour in relation to the developmental stage of their cocoon. Mothers’ behaviour appears to be linked to both internal (physiological state) and external mechanisms (signals from the cocoon).	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

Intranasal drug delivery has attracted significant attention because of the opportunity to deliver systemic drugs directly to the blood stream. However, the mucociliary clearance poses a challenge in gaining high efficacy of intranasal drug delivery because cilia continuously carry the mucus blanket towards the laryngeal region. To better understand mucus flow behaviour on the human nasal cavity wall, we present computational model development, and evaluation of mucus motion on a realistic nasal cavity model reconstructed from CT-scans. The model development involved two approaches based on the actual nasal cavity geometry namely: (i) unwrapped-surface model in 2D domain and (ii) 3D-shell model. Conservation equations of fluid motion were applied to the domains, where a mucus production source term was used to initiate the mucus motion. The analysis included mucus flow patterns, virtual saccharin tests and quantitative velocity magnitude analysis, which demonstrated that the 3D-shell model results provided better agreement with experimental data. The unwrapped-surface model also suffered from mesh-deformations during the unwrapping stage and this led to higher mucus velocity compared to experimental data. Therefore, the 3D-shell model was recommended for future mucus flow simulations. As a first step towards mucus motion modelling this study provides important information that accurately simulates a mucus velocity field on a human nasal cavity wall, for assessment of toxicology and efficacy of intranasal drug delivery.	0	Journal of biomechanics

As interest in the role of extracellular vesicles in cell-to-cell communication has increased, so has the use of microscopy and analytical techniques to assess their formation, release, and morphology. In this study, we evaluate scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM for characterizing the formation and shedding of vesicles from human breast cell lines, parental and hyaluronan synthase 3-(HAS3)-overexpressing MCF10A cells grown directly on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids. While cells imaged with conventional- and cryo-SEM exhibit distinct morphologies due to the sample preparation process for each technique, tubular structures protruding from the cell surfaces were observed with both approaches. For HAS3-MCF10A cells, vesicles were present along the length of membrane protrusions. Once completely shed from the cells, extracellular vesicles were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and cryo-TEM. The size distributions obtained by each technique were different not only in the range of vesicles analyzed, but also in the relative proportion of smaller-to-larger vesicles. These differences are attributed to the presence of biological debris in the media, which is difficult to differentiate from vesicles in NTA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cryo-TEM can be used to distinguish between vesicles based on their respective surface structures, thereby providing a path to differentiating vesicle subpopulations and identifying their size distributions. Our study emphasizes the necessity of pairing several techniques to characterize extracellular vesicles.	0	Journal of structural biology
87	204787348	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.3000443	204787348	Machine learning of human plasma lipidomes for obesity estimation in a large population cohort	Obesity is associated with changes in the plasma lipids. Although simple lipid quantification is routinely used, plasma lipids are rarely investigated at the level of individual molecules. We aimed at predicting different measures of obesity based on the plasma lipidome in a large population cohort using advanced machine learning modeling. A total of 1,061 participants of the FINRISK 2012 population cohort were randomly chosen, and the levels of 183 plasma lipid species were measured in a novel mass spectrometric shotgun approach. Multiple machine intelligence models were trained to predict obesity estimates, i.e., body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BFP), and validated in 250 randomly chosen participants of the Malmö Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC). Comparison of the different models revealed that the lipidome predicted BFP the best (R2 = 0.73), based on a Lasso model. In this model, the strongest positive and the strongest negative predictor were sphingomyelin molecules, which differ by only 1 double bond, implying the involvement of an unknown desaturase in obesity-related aberrations of lipid metabolism. Moreover, we used this regression to probe the clinically relevant information contained in the plasma lipidome and found that the plasma lipidome also contains information about body fat distribution, because WHR (R2 = 0.65) was predicted more accurately than BMI (R2 = 0.47). These modeling results required full resolution of the lipidome to lipid species level, and the predicting set of biomarkers had to be sufficiently large. The power of the lipidomics association was demonstrated by the finding that the addition of routine clinical laboratory variables, e.g., high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- or low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol did not improve the model further. Correlation analyses of the individual lipid species, controlled for age and separated by sex, underscores the multiparametric and lipid species-specific nature of the correlation with the BFP. Lipidomic measurements in combination with machine intelligence modeling contain rich information about body fat amount and distribution beyond traditional clinical assays.	0	PLoS biology
88	395594	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.1002395	395594	Hemotin, a Regulator of Phagocytosis Encoded by a Small ORF and Conserved across Metazoans	Translation of hundreds of small ORFs (smORFs) of less than 100 amino acids has recently been revealed in vertebrates and Drosophila. Some of these peptides have essential and conserved cellular functions. In Drosophila, we have predicted a particular smORF class encoding ~80 aa hydrophobic peptides, which may function in membranes and cell organelles. Here, we characterise hemotin, a gene encoding an 88aa transmembrane smORF peptide localised to early endosomes in Drosophila macrophages. hemotin regulates endosomal maturation during phagocytosis by repressing the cooperation of 14-3-3ζ with specific phosphatidylinositol (PI) enzymes. hemotin mutants accumulate undigested phagocytic material inside enlarged endo-lysosomes and as a result, hemotin mutants have reduced ability to fight bacteria, and hence, have severely reduced life span and resistance to infections. We identify Stannin, a peptide involved in organometallic toxicity, as the Hemotin functional homologue in vertebrates, showing that this novel regulator of phagocytic processing is widely conserved, emphasizing the significance of smORF peptides in cell biology and disease.	0	PLoS biology

Many Gram-negative bacteria deliver their virulence factors into host cells through a secretion system. Those factors, called effector proteins, are involved in the pathogenicity in host cells by interfering with various cellular events. The phytopathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae uses a type III secretion system to inject its effectors, but the functional roles of these proteins remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we determined a crystal structure of XOO4466, an effector from X. oryzae pv. oryzae, and performed a functional analysis. We determined that XOO4466 is similar in sequence to Xanthomonas outer protein Q, a putative nucleoside hydrolase (NH). The overall structure of XOO4466 is homologous to that of NHs, including a metal-binding site, but differs in its oligomeric state and active site topology. Further analysis indicated that antiparallel β-strands commonly found in NHs adjacent to the active site loop are replaced in XOO4466 with a short loop, causing the active site loop to adopt a conformation distinct from that of NHs. Thus, the catalytic residues emanating from the respective active site loop of NHs are absent in the putative active site of XOO4466. Consistent with these structural features, a functional assay indicated that XOO4466 does not exhibit NH activity and possibly catalyzes yet unknown reactions.	0	Journal of structural biology

Our histological work showed that each sensillum contains lipid layers surrounding a protein layer and a unique polysaccharide base that is associated with a neuron to each sensillum. Infrared microscopy showed that the protein region maximally absorbs infrared radiation at 3 μm wavelength and at 10 μm, which corresponds to the known radiation produced by forest fires at 3 μm. Mathematical calculations showed that the physical properties of the sensilla are such that the expected temperature rise is insufficient for transduction of the infrared signal through mechanical means or as a thermal receptor as previously thought; hence the protein plays the pivotal role in perception of single photons and transmission of the signal within the sensilla.	1	Journal of Bionic Engineering

Thus the Scaly-foot Snail is an ideal model to study the genomic mechanisms underlying the evolutionary diversification of biomineralised armour. Here, we present a high-quality whole-genome assembly and tissue-specific transcriptomic data, and show that scale and shell formation in the Scaly-foot Snail employ independent subsets of 25 highly-expressed transcription factors. Comparisons with other lophotrochozoan genomes imply that this biomineralisation toolkit is ancient, though expression patterns differ across major lineages. We suggest that the ability of lophotrochozoan lineages to generate a wide range of hard parts, exemplified by the remarkable morphological disparity in Mollusca, draws on a capacity for dynamic modification of the expression and positioning of toolkit elements across the genome. The Scaly-foot Snail, Chrysomallon squamiferum , is a model for understanding the evolution of biomineralised armour. Here, the authors present a chromosome-level reference genome assembly and tissue-specific transcriptomic data for this enigmatic organism.	1	Nature Communications

Using CF and CF–FM echolocation signals as acoustic stimuli, the responses of inferior collicular (IC) neurons of Hipposideros armiger were obtained by extracellular recordings. We tested the effect of preceding CF or CF–FM sounds on the shape of the frequency tuning curves (FTCs) of IC neurons. Results showed that both CF–FM and CF sounds reduced the number of FTCs with tailed lower-frequency-side of IC neurons. However, more IC neurons experienced such conversion after adding CF–FM sound compared with CF sound. We also found that the Q20 value of the FTC of IC neurons experienced the largest increase with the addition of CF–FM sound. Moreover, only CF–FM sound could cause an increase in the slope of the neurons’ FTCs, and such increase occurred mainly in the lower-frequency edge. These results suggested that CF–FM sound could increase the accuracy of frequency analysis of echo and cut-off low-frequency elements from the habitat of bats more than CF sound.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

Gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase is responsible for gastric acid secretion. In order to characterize the phosphorylation events on H(+),K(+)-ATPase, the properties of fluorinated phosphate analogs [XFs, e.g. aluminum fluoride (AlF), beryllium fluoride (BeF) and magnesium fluoride (MgF)], and the structural differences induced by XFs were investigated. The addition of divalent cations to the XF-inhibited H(+),K(+)-ATPase restores the activity of the AlF- or MgF-inhibited, but not of the BeF-inhibited enzyme, although limited trypsin digestion reveals that they assume the same E(2)P-like state. To clarify the conformational differences induced by XFs, the structure of BeF-bound H(+),K(+)-ATPase was analyzed at 8A resolution. The structure is almost identical to the previously reported AlF-bound E(2)P structure, unlike the distinctive X-ray structure of BeF-bound SERCA, in which the luminal gate was observed to be widely opened. Since the analyzed structure of the H(+),K(+)-ATPase revealed that both AlF and BeF-bound to the P domain were not exposed to the solvent, the dissociation of XFs induced by divalent cations could be interpreted in terms of stability against thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, the conformational differences found between the cytoplasmic domains of H(+),K(+)-ATPase and SERCA provide a framework to understand the characteristic mechanism, by which divalent cations reactivate the XF-inhibited H(+),K(+)-ATPase.	0	Journal of structural biology
94	203623763	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.3000168	203623763	Opposing signaling pathways regulate morphology in response to temperature in the fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum	Phenotypic switching between 2 opposing cellular states is a fundamental aspect of biology, and fungi provide facile systems to analyze the interactions between regulons that control this type of switch. A long-standing mystery in fungal pathogens of humans is how thermally dimorphic fungi switch their developmental form in response to temperature. These fungi, including the subject of this study, Histoplasma capsulatum, are temperature-responsive organisms that utilize unknown regulatory pathways to couple their cell shape and associated attributes to the temperature of their environment. H. capsulatum grows as a multicellular hypha in the soil that switches to a pathogenic yeast form in response to the temperature of a mammalian host. These states can be triggered in the laboratory simply by growing the fungus either at room temperature (RT; which promotes hyphal growth) or at 37 °C (which promotes yeast-phase growth). Prior worked revealed that 15% to 20% of transcripts are differentially expressed in response to temperature, but it is unclear which transcripts are linked to specific phenotypic changes, such as cell morphology or virulence. To elucidate temperature-responsive regulons, we previously identified 4 transcription factors (required for yeast-phase growth [Ryp]1–4) that are required for yeast-phase growth at 37 °C; in each ryp mutant, the fungus grows constitutively as hyphae regardless of temperature, and the cells fail to express genes that are normally induced in response to growth at 37 °C. Here, we perform the first genetic screen to identify genes required for hyphal growth of H. capsulatum at RT and find that disruption of the signaling mucin MSB2 results in a yeast-locked phenotype. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) experiments reveal that MSB2 is not required for the majority of gene expression changes that occur when cells are shifted to RT. However, a small subset of temperature-responsive genes is dependent on MSB2 for its expression, thereby implicating these genes in the process of filamentation. Disruption or knockdown of an Msb2-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (HOG2) and an APSES transcription factor (STU1) prevents hyphal growth at RT, validating that the Msb2 regulon contains genes that control filamentation. Notably, the Msb2 regulon shows conserved hyphal-specific expression in other dimorphic fungi, suggesting that this work defines a small set of genes that are likely to be conserved regulators and effectors of filamentation in multiple fungi. In contrast, a few yeast-specific transcripts, including virulence factors that are normally expressed only at 37 °C, are inappropriately expressed at RT in the msb2 mutant, suggesting that expression of these genes is coupled to growth in the yeast form rather than to temperature. Finally, we find that the yeast-promoting transcription factor Ryp3 associates with the MSB2 promoter and inhibits MSB2 transcript expression at 37 °C, whereas Msb2 inhibits accumulation of Ryp transcripts and proteins at RT. These findings indicate that the Ryp and Msb2 circuits antagonize each other in a temperature-dependent manner, thereby allowing temperature to govern cell shape and gene expression in this ubiquitous fungal pathogen of humans.	0	PLoS biology
95	444367	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2001073	444367	A latitudinal phylogeographic diversity gradient in birds	High tropical species diversity is often attributed to evolutionary dynamics over long timescales. It is possible, however, that latitudinal variation in diversification begins when divergence occurs within species. Phylogeographic data capture this initial stage of diversification in which populations become geographically isolated and begin to differentiate genetically. There is limited understanding of the broader implications of intraspecific diversification because comparative analyses have focused on species inhabiting and evolving in restricted regions and environments. Here, we scale comparative phylogeography up to the hemisphere level and examine whether the processes driving latitudinal differences in species diversity are also evident within species. We collected genetic data for 210 New World bird species distributed across a broad latitudinal gradient and estimated a suite of metrics characterizing phylogeographic history. We found that lower latitude species had, on average, greater phylogeographic diversity than higher latitude species and that intraspecific diversity showed evidence of greater persistence in the tropics. Factors associated with species ecologies, life histories, and habitats explained little of the variation in phylogeographic structure across the latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that the latitudinal gradient in species richness originates, at least partly, from population-level processes within species and are consistent with hypotheses implicating age and environmental stability in the formation of diversity gradients. Comparative phylogeographic analyses scaled up to large geographic regions and hundreds of species can show connections between population-level processes and broad-scale species-richness patterns.	0	PLoS biology
96	2431492	10.1016/J.BIOORG.2006.08.001	2431492	Characterization of two new multiforms of Trametes pubescens laccase.	Electrochemical properties of two multiforms of laccase from Trametes pubescens basidiomycete (LAC1 and LAC2) have been studied. The standard redox potentials of the T1 sites of the enzymes were found to be 746 and 738 mV vs. NHE for LAC1 and LAC2, respectively. Bioelectroreduction of oxygen based on direct electron transfer between each of the two forms of Trametes pubescens laccase and spectrographic graphite electrodes has been demonstrated and studied. It is concluded that the T1 site of laccase is the first electron acceptor, both in solution (homogeneous case) and when the enzymes are adsorbed on the surface of the graphite electrode (heterogeneous case). Thus, the previously proposed mechanism of oxygen bioelectroreduction by adsorbed fungal laccase was additionally confirmed using two forms of the enzyme. Moreover, the assumed need for extracellular laccase to communicate directly and electronically with a solid matrix (lignin) in the course of lignin degradation is discussed. In summary, the possible roles of multiforms of the enzyme based on their electrochemical, biochemical, spectral, and kinetic properties have been suggested to consist in broadening of the substrate specificity of the enzyme, in turn yielding the possibility to dynamically regulate the process of lignin degradation according to the real-time survival needs of the organism.	1	Bioorganic Chemistry

Here, we report that αSacetyl is more effective at inducing intracellular aggregation in primary neurons than unmodified αS (αSun). We identify complex N-linked glycans as binding partners for αSacetyl and demonstrate that cellular internalization of αSacetyl is reduced significantly upon cleavage of extracellular N-linked glycans, but not other carbohydrates. We verify binding of αSacetyl to N-linked glycans in vitro, using both isolated glycans and cell-derived proteoliposomes. Finally, we identify neurexin 1β, a neuronal glycoprotein, as capable of driving glycan-dependent uptake of αSacetyl. Importantly, our results are specific to αSacetyl because αSun does not demonstrate sensitivity for N-linked glycans in any of our assays. Our study identifies extracellular N-linked glycans—and the glycoprotein neurexin 1β specifically—as key modulators of neuronal uptake of αSacetyl, drawing attention to the potential therapeutic value of αSacetyl-glycan interactions.	0	PLoS biology
98	40470494	10.1016/J.JSB.2013.01.009	40470494	The architecture of the joint head cuticle and its transition to the arthrodial membrane in the terrestrial crustacean Porcellio scaber.	The cuticle of terrestrial isopods is an interesting model for the study of structure-function relationships in biological composite materials. Its organic matrix has a hierarchically organised structure, and type and phase of the mineral compound can vary. The cuticle forms functionally diverse skeletal elements whose properties are adapted to their specific functions. In order to better understand the relation between structure, composition and function of isopod cuticle, we studied the structure and composition of the joint head that is part of the pereiopod's basis. It consists of a central region, whose shape fits well into the joint socket, and an edge region that is connected to the soft arthrodial membrane and protects the central region from mechanical load. The cuticle architecture of the joint head has local variations in structure and composition. In the central region the cuticle is similar to the previously published tergite cuticle. High concentrations of amorphous calcium phosphate are located in the endocuticle suggesting a coexistence with amorphous calcium carbonate. The edge region has an unexpected organisation characterised by thickening of the epi- and exocuticle and an unusual unidirectional orientation of chitin-protein fibrils within the endocuticle. The concentrations of phosphate are considerably higher than in the central region. The overall differentiation in the cuticular architecture of the edge in comparison to the central region reflects the adaptation to mechanical strains the cuticle has to sustain during contraction of extensor muscles, and to the structural and compositional transition from the edge to the connecting arthrodial membrane.	0	Journal of structural biology

Low impact falls to the side are the main cause of hip fractures in elderly. Finite element (FE) models of the proximal femur may help in the assessment of patients at high risk for a hip fracture. However, extensive validation is essential before these models can be used in a clinical setting. This study aims to use strain measurements from bilateral digital image correlation to validate an FE model against ex vivo experimental data of proximal femora under a sideways fall loading condition. For twelve subjects, full-field strain measurements were available on the medial and lateral side of the femoral neck. In this study, subject-specific FE models were generated based on a consolidated procedure previously validated for stance loading. The material description included strain rate dependency and separate yield and fracture strain limits in tension and compression. FE predicted fracture force and experimentally measured peak forces showed a strong correlation (R2 = 0.92). The FE simulations predicted the fracture initiation within 3 mm distance of the experimental fracture line for 8/12 subjects. The predicted and measured strains correlated well on both the medial side (R2 = 0.87) and the lateral side (R2 = 0.74). The lower correlation on the lateral side is attributed to the irregularity of the cortex and presence of vessel holes in this region. The combined validation against bilateral full-field strain measurements and peak forces has opened the door for a more elaborate qualitative and quantitative validation of FE models of femora under sideways fall loading.	0	Journal of biomechanics

 SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more severe disease in pregnant women compared to age-matched non-pregnant women. Whether maternal infection causes changes in the transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems serology to characterize the Fc-profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in third trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression. These results point to unexpected compensatory mechanisms to boost immunity in neonates, providing insights for maternal vaccine design.

101	51706456	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2003903	51706456	Genome-wide maps of ribosomal occupancy provide insights into adaptive evolution and regulatory roles of uORFs during Drosophila development	Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) play important roles in regulating the main coding DNA sequences (CDSs) via translational repression. Despite their prevalence in the genomes, uORFs are overall discriminated against by natural selection. However, it remains unclear why in the genomes there are so many uORFs more conserved than expected under the assumption of neutral evolution. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of translational efficiency (TE) at the codon level throughout the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 35,735 uORFs that were expressed, and 32,224 (90.2%) of them showed evidence of ribosome occupancy during Drosophila development. The ribosome occupancy of uORFs is determined by genomic features, such as optimized sequence contexts around their start codons, a shorter distance to CDSs, and higher coding potentials. Our population genomic analysis suggests the segregating mutations that create or disrupt uORFs are overall deleterious in D. melanogaster. However, we found for the first time that many (68.3% of) newly fixed uORFs that are associated with ribosomes in D. melanogaster are driven by positive Darwinian selection. Our findings also suggest that uORFs play a vital role in controlling the translational program in Drosophila. Moreover, we found that many uORFs are transcribed or translated in a developmental stage-, sex-, or tissue-specific manner, suggesting that selective transcription or translation of uORFs could potentially modulate the TE of the downstream CDSs during Drosophila development.	0	PLoS biology

However, little is known about the molecular architecture of the tight junction (TJ) complex and the regulation of paracellular permeability characteristics in these tissues. In the current studies, puffer fish (Tetraodon biocellatus) were acclimated to freshwater (FW), seawater (SW) or ion-poor freshwater (IPW) conditions. Following acclimation, alterations in systemic endpoints of hydromineral status were examined in conjunction with changes in gill and kidney epithelia morphology/morphometrics, as well as claudin TJ protein mRNA abundance. T. biocellatus were able to maintain endpoints of hydromineral status within relatively tight limits across the broad range of water ion content examined. Both gill and kidney tissue exhibited substantial alterations in morphology as well as claudin TJ protein mRNA abundance. These responses were particularly pronounced when comparing fish acclimated to SW versus those acclimated to IPW. TEM observations of IPW-acclimated fish gills revealed the presence of cells that exhibited the typical characteristics of gill mitochondria-rich cells (e.g. voluminous, Na+-K+-ATPase-immunoreactive, exposed to the external environment at the apical surface), but were not mitochondria-rich. To our knowledge, this type of cell has not previously been described in hyperosmoregulating fish gills. Furthermore, modifications in the morphometrics and claudin mRNA abundance of kidney tissue support the notion that spatial alterations in claudin TJ proteins along the nephron of fishes will likely play an important role in the regulation of salt and water balance in these organisms.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B
103	914857	10.1038/NATURE05466	914857	Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila	Blood-feeding insects, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, use highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts. This is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, which include carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. The molecular identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases.	1	Nature
104	3908882	10.1016/J.JSB.2016.10.003	3908882	Dynamic disorder can explain non-exponential kinetics of fast protein mechanical unfolding.	Protein unfolding often does not obey a simple two-state behavior. Previous single molecule force spectroscopy studies demonstrated stretched exponential kinetics of protein unfolding under a constant pulling force, the molecular origin of which remains subject to debate. We here set out to extensively sample the mechanical unfolding of ubiquitin and NuG2 by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Both proteins show kinetics best fit by stretched exponentials, with stretching exponents similar to those found in experiments, even though static disorder is absent in our short MD simulations. Instead, we can ascribe non-exponential kinetics to dynamic disorder, due to conformational fluctuations on the nanosecond timescale. Our study highlights the general role of dynamic disorder in protein kinetics on a broad range of time scales even including those probed in MD simulations.	0	Journal of structural biology

After dissolving the protein matrix of chitin‐protein microfibrils with NaOH, the orientation of the axial chitin fibers was three‐dimensionally demonstrated. Microfibrils of the outermost exocuticular lamella lie parallel to the slope of the cone surface of the MT and rotate slightly on the top of the MT. Microfibrils of the external lamella of the transitional area between planar cuticle and conical cuticle of the MT corresponded to the shape of the surface within one lamella and preferred directions of MT's microfibrils in the successive lamella rotated. In the deeper layers of the cuticle, the rotation of both the microfibrils and successive lamella results in the twisted straw architecture of the microfibrils' composition within the MT. The deepest microfibrils that are located close to the axis of the MT form compact clusters of fibrils (1.0–1.5 μm length). The twisted‐straw architecture of microfibrils in the MT is derived from principles of development of extracellular fibrous composites. It is suggested, however, that this architecture has an additional functional significance as a strategic design with particular mechanical properties. J.

Recent studies demonstrated that uniaxial transverse loading (FG) of a rat gastrocnemius medialis muscle resulted in a considerable reduction of maximum isometric muscle force (ΔFim). A hill-type muscle model assuming an identical gearing G between both ΔFim and FG as well as lifting height of the load (Δh) and longitudinal muscle shortening (ΔlCC) reproduced experimental data for a single load. Here we tested if this model is able to reproduce experimental changes in ΔFim and Δh for increasing transverse loads (0.64 N, 1.13 N, 1.62 N, 2.11 N, 2.60 N). Three different gearing ratios were tested: (I) constant Gc representing the idea of a muscle specific gearing parameter (e.g. predefined by the muscle geometry), (II) Gexp determined in experiments with varying transverse load, and (III) Gf that reproduced experimental ΔFim for each transverse load. Simulations using Gc overestimated ΔFim (up to 59%) and Δh (up to 136%) for increasing load. Although the model assumption (equal G for forces and length changes) held for the three lower loads using Gexp and Gf, simulations resulted in underestimation of ΔFim by 38% and overestimation of Δh by 58% for the largest load, respectively. To simultaneously reproduce experimental ΔFim and Δh for the two larger loads, it was necessary to reduce Fim by 1.9% and 4.6%, respectively. The model seems applicable to account for effects of muscle deformation within a range of transverse loading when using a linear load-dependent function for G.	0	Journal of biomechanics
107	25144998	10.1242/JEB.058172	25144998	Localized fluidization burrowing mechanics of Ensis directus	SUMMARY Muscle measurements of Ensis directus, the Atlantic razor clam, indicate that the organism only has sufficient strength to burrow a few centimeters into the soil, yet razor clams burrow to over 70 cm. In this paper, we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.	1	The Journal of Experimental Biology
108	212728636	10.1016/J.JSB.2020.107494	212728636	Insights into the stability and substrate specificity of the E. coli aerobic β-oxidation trifunctional enzyme complex.	Degradation of fatty acids by the β-oxidation pathway results in the formation of acetyl-CoA which enters the TCA cycle for the production of ATP. In E. coli the last three steps of the β-oxidation are catalyzed by two heterotetrameric α2β2 enzymes namely the aerobic trifunctional enzyme (EcTFE) and the anaerobic TFE (anEcTFE). The α subunit of TFE has 2E-enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) and 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activities whereas the β subunit is a thiolase with 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT) activity. Recently, it has been shown that the two TFEs have complementary substrate specificities allowing for the complete degradation of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs into acetyl-CoA under aerobic conditions. Also, it has been shown that the tetrameric EcTFE and anEcTFE assemblies are similar to the TFEs of Pseudomans fragi and human, respectively. Here the properties of the EcTFE subunits are further characterized. Strikingly, it is observed that when expressed separately, EcTFE-α is a catalytically active monomer whereas EcTFE-β is inactive. However, when mixed together active EcTFE tetramer is reconstituted. The crystal structure of the EcTFE-α chain is also reported, complexed with ATP, bound in its HAD active site. Structural comparisons show that the EcTFE hydratase active site has a relatively small fatty acyl tail binding pocket when compared to other TFEs in good agreement with its preferred specificity for short chain 2E-enoyl-CoA substrates. Furthermore, it is observed that millimolar concentrations of ATP destabilize the EcTFE complex, and this may have implications for the ATP-mediated regulation of β-oxidation in E. coli.	0	Journal of structural biology

We show that flavivirus infection of enteric neurons leads to acute neuronal injury and cell death, inflammation, bowel dilation, and slowing of intestinal transit in mice. Flavivirus-primed CD8+ T cells promote these phenotypes, as their absence diminished enteric neuron injury and intestinal transit delays, and their adoptive transfer reestablished dysmotility after flavivirus infection. Remarkably, mice surviving acute flavivirus infection developed chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility that was exacerbated by immunization with an unrelated alphavirus vaccine or exposure to a non-infectious inflammatory stimulus. This model of chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal dysmotility in mice suggests that viral infections with tropism for enteric neurons and the ensuing immune response might contribute to the development of bowel motility disorders in humans. These results suggest an opportunity for unique approaches to diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes.	0	Cell

 T cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the repertoire of naturally processed and presented viral epitopes on HLA class I remains uncharacterized. Here, we report the first HLA-I immunopeptidome of SARS-CoV-2 in two cell lines at different times post-infection using mass spectrometry. We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from canonical ORFs, but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in Spike and Nucleocapsid not captured by current vaccines. Some peptides from out-of-frame ORFs elicited T cell responses in a humanized mouse model and COVID-19 patients that exceeded responses to canonical peptides including some of the strongest epitopes reported to date. Whole proteome analysis of infected cells revealed that early expressed viral proteins contribute more to HLA-I presentation and immunogenicity. These biological insights as well as the discovery of out-of-frame ORF epitopes will facilitate selection of peptides for immune monitoring and vaccine development.

111	22043153	10.1007/S00360-016-1032-Y	22043153	Seasonal changes of cholinergic response in the atrium of Arctic navaga cod (Eleginus navaga)	Fishes of north-temperate latitudes exhibit marked seasonal changes in electrical excitability of the heart partly as an outcome of temperature-dependent changes in the density of major K+ ion currents: delayed rectifiers (IKr, IKs) and background inward rectifier (IK1). In the arctic teleost, navaga cod (Eleginus navaga), IKr and IK1 are strongly up-regulated in winter. The current study tests the hypothesis that the ligand-gated K+ current, the acetylcholine-activated inward rectifier, IKACh, is also modified by seasonal acclimatization in atrial myocytes of navaga. In sinoatrial preparations of the summer-acclimatized (SA) navaga, 10−6 M carbamylcholine chloride (CCh) caused slowing of heart rate, shortening of atrial action potential (AP) duration and a drastic reduction of AP amplitude, eventually resulting in inexcitability. In winter-acclimatized (WA) atria CCh slowed HR and reduced AP duration, but reduction of AP amplitude was modest and never resulted in inexcitability. The difference in cholinergic response between SA and WA navaga is explained by seasonal changes in IKACh density. The peak density of IKACh, induced by 10−5 M CCh, at the common experimental temperature (+6 °C) was 0.97 ± 0.28 pA/pF in SA navaga but only 0.183 ± 0.013 pA/pF in WA navaga (a 5.3-fold difference, P < 0.05). At acclimatization temperatures of the fish IKACh density was 2.8 ± 0.50 (at +12 °C) and 0.11 ± 0.06 pA/pF (at +3 °C) (a 26-fold difference, P < 0.05) for SA and WA navaga, respectively. Thus, acclimatization to summer induces a drastic up-regulation of the atrial IKACh, which effectively shortens atrial AP. The reverse temperature compensation of the atrial IKACh may be advantageous in summer under variable water temperatures and oxygen concentrations by reducing workload of the heart.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

However, for visually oriented organisms, the process of visual motion detection is often equally crucial to survival and reproduction. Despite the importance of motion detection to many organisms’ daily activities, the degree of interspecific variation in the perception of visual motion remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the factors driving this potential variation (e.g., ecology or evolutionary history) along with the effects of such variation on behavior are unknown. We used a behavioral assay under laboratory conditions to quantify the visual motion detection systems of three species of Puerto Rican Anolis lizard that prefer distinct structural habitat types. We then compared our results to data previously collected for anoles from Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Central America. Our findings indicate that general visual motion detection parameters are similar across species, regardless of habitat preference or evolutionary history. We argue that these conserved sensory properties may drive the evolution of visual communication behavior in this clade.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A
113	52070926	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2007047	52070926	Response to Bode and colleagues: ‘Resilient reefs may exist, but can larval dispersal models find them?’	Bode and colleagues’ response to our paper posits that the identification of specific reefs that drive recovery is unsafe because models of larval dispersal (‘connectivity’) are insufficiently accurate or consistent to make useful predictions at this scale [1]. They go on to argue that managers should not base decisions on reef-level predictions of connectivity. The evidence they provide for these assertions is that the results of their own modelling—with a different model but run with a ‘comparable parameterisation’—diverge considerably from ours. The legitimacy of Bode and colleagues’ concern rests on the apparent disparity in behaviour between connectivity models. Unfortunately, Bode and colleagues’ study differs from ours in many more ways than simply the modelling of oceanography. In short, (1) their representation of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) excludes approximately half the reefs we recognise (2,175 versus 3,806), so the network metrics of those reefs ‘in common’ are incomparable; (2) they represent different species by ignoring larvae with short settlement times (<7–14 days) and allowing a continuous release of larvae, whereas we considered a wider range of competencies beginning at 12 hours and simulated punctuated spawning events that are more relevant to invertebrates; (3) their model was parameterised two decades ago (1996–2002), so their assessment makes the unlikely assumption that conditions had not changed by the recent period we represented (2008–2013); (4) their model is unable to capture an important dispersal process on the GBR because it takes a two-dimensional depth-integrated approach that ignores the shear flow captured in our 3D Connie model; and (5) they were unable to implement all of the connectivity criteria we applied. Specifically, their finding of a strongly connected network precluded use of graph theory to identify regionally connected sources as we did. The causes of such strong connections in Bode and colleagues’ analysis are unclear but likely include use of higher rates of larval release and a continuous release period of 156 days, though we consider this to be an inappropriate representation of coral spawning, and we elected to retain the temporal dynamics of multiple punctuated spawning events. Given these five fundamental differences, it is not surprising that their assessment of connectivity patterns differed from ours. However, this discrepancy does not imply that choice of hydrodynamic model alone is the cause. Nor does it constitute evidence that our identification of key source reefs is too uncertain to be useful. The eReefs/Connie hydrodynamic model we adopted has been calibrated against data from tide gauges, wave-rider buoys, an extensive array of moorings and temperature loggers across the GBR, and Argo floats [2] as well as formal assimilation of satellite data.

This study proposed a method to quantify direct and indirect effects of the joint torque inputs in the speed-generating mechanism of a swinging motion. Linear and angular accelerations of all segments within a multi-linked system can be expressed as the sum of contributions from a joint torque term, gravitational force term and motion-dependent term (MDT), where the MDT is a nonlinear term consisting of centrifugal force, Coriolis force and gyroscopic effect moment components. Direct effects result from angular accelerations induced by a joint torque at a given instant, whereas indirect effects arise through the MDT induced by joint torques exerted in the past. These two effects were quantified for the kicking-side leg during a rugby place kick. The MDT was the largest contributor to the foot centre of gravity (CG)'s speed at ball contact. Of the factors responsible for generating the MDT, the direct and indirect effects of the hip flexion-extension torque during both the flight phase (from the final kicking foot take-off to support foot contact) and the subsequent support phase (from support foot contact to ball contact) were important contributors to the foot CG's speed at ball contact. The indirect effect of the ankle plantar-dorsal flexion torque and the direct effect of the knee flexion-extension torque during the support phase showed the largest positive and negative contributions to the foot CG's speed at ball contact, respectively. The proposed method allows the identification of which individual joint torque axes are crucial and the timings of joint torque exertion that are used to generate a high speed of the distal point of a multi-linked system.	0	Journal of biomechanics

To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe >4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ∼30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported.	0	Cell

Isolated or as a part of multidomain proteins, Sterol Carrier Protein 2 (SCP2) exhibits high affinity and broad specificity for different lipidic and hydrophobic compounds. A wealth of structural information on SCP2 domains in all forms of life is currently available; however, many aspects of its ligand binding activity are poorly understood. ylSCP2 is a well-characterized single domain SCP2 from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Herein, we report the X-ray structure of unliganded ylSCP2 refined to 2.0 Å resolution. Comparison with the previously solved liganded ylSCP2 structure unveiled a novel mechanism for binding site occlusion. The liganded ylSCP2 binding site is a large cavity with a volume of more than 800 Å3. In unliganded ylSCP2 the binding site is reduced to about 140 Å3. The obliteration is caused by a swing movement of the C-terminal α helix 5 and a subtle compaction of helices 2-4. Previous pairwise comparisons were between homologous SCP2 domains with a uncertain binding status. The reported unliganded ylSCP2 structure allows for the first time a fully controlled comparative analysis of the conformational effects of ligand occupation dispelling several doubts regarding the architecture of SCP2 binding site.	0	Journal of structural biology

Traumatic cervical facet dislocation (CFD) is often associated with devastating spinal cord injury. Facet fractures commonly occur during CFD, yet quantitative measures of facet deflection, strain, stiffness and failure load have not been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanical response of the subaxial cervical facets when loaded in directions thought to be associated with traumatic bilateral CFD - anterior shear and flexion. Thirty-one functional spinal units (6 × C2/3, C3/4, C4/5, and C6/7, 7 × C5/6) were dissected from fourteen human cadaver cervical spines (mean donor age 69 years, range 48-92; eight male). Loading was applied to the inferior facets of the inferior vertebra to simulate the in vivo inter-facet loading experienced during supraphysiologic anterior shear and flexion motion. Specimens were subjected to three cycles of sub-failure loading (10-100 N, 1 mm/s) in each direction, before being failed in a randomly assigned direction (10 mm/s). Facet deflection, surface strains, stiffness, and failure load were measured. Linear mixed-effects models (α = 0.05; random effect of cadaver) accounted for variations in specimen geometry and bone density. Specimen-specific parameters were significantly associated with most outcome measures. Facet stiffness and failure load were significantly greater in the simulated flexion loading direction, and deflection and surface strains were higher in anterior shear at the non-destructive analysis point (47 N applied load). The sub-failure strains and stiffness responses differed between the upper and lower subaxial cervical regions. Failure occurred through the facet tip during anterior shear loading, while failure through the pedicles was most common in flexion.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia–Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment–payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.	1	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

Despite its close phylogenetic relationship to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits increased human-to-human transmission dynamics, likely due to efficient early replication in the upper respiratory epithelium of infected individuals. Since different temperatures encountered in the human upper and lower respiratory tract (33°C and 37°C, respectively) have been shown to affect the replication kinetics of several respiratory viruses, as well as host innate immune response dynamics, we investigated the impact of temperature on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection using the primary human airway epithelial cell culture model. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated to higher titers when infections were performed at 33°C rather than 37°C. Although both viruses were highly sensitive to type I and type III interferon pretreatment, a detailed time-resolved transcriptome analysis revealed temperature-dependent interferon and pro-inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 that were inversely proportional to its replication efficiency at 33°C or 37°C. These data provide crucial insight on pivotal virus–host interaction dynamics and are in line with characteristic clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, as well as their respective transmission efficiencies.	0	PLoS biology

"The objective of this study was to characterize the relationships between motion in the scalp, skull, and brain. In vivo estimates of motion transmission from the skull to the brain may illuminate the mechanics of traumatic brain injury. Because of challenges in directly sensing skull motion, it is useful to know how well motion of soft tissue of the head, i.e., the scalp, can approximate skull motion or predict brain tissue deformation. In this study, motion of the scalp and brain were measured using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and separated into components due to rigid-body displacement and dynamic deformation. Displacement estimates in the scalp were calculated using low motion-encoding gradient strength in order to reduce ""phase wrapping"" (an ambiguity in displacement estimates caused by the 2 π-periodicity of MRE phase contrast). MRE estimates of scalp and brain motion were compared to skull motion estimated from three tri-axial accelerometers. Comparison of the relative amplitudes and phases of harmonic motion in the scalp, skull, and brain of six human subjects indicate that data from scalp-based sensors should be used with caution to estimate skull kinematics, but that fairly consistent relationships exist between scalp, skull, and brain motion. In addition, the measured amplitude and phase relationships of scalp, skull, and brain can be used to evaluate and improve mathematical models of head biomechanics."	0	Journal of biomechanics

In the present study, duration tuning was examined in the auditory cortex of M. molossus to describe if it is as ambiguous as the collicular tuning. From a population of 174 cortical 104 (60 %) neurons did not show duration selectivity (all-pass). Around 5 % (9 units) responded preferentially to stimuli having longer durations showing long-pass duration response functions, 35 (20 %) responded to a narrow range of stimulus durations showing band-pass duration response functions, 24 (14 %) responded most strongly to short stimulus durations showing short-pass duration response functions and two neurons (1 %) responded best to two different stimulus durations showing a two-peaked duration–response function. The majority of neurons showing short- (16 out of 24) and band-pass (24 out 35) selectivity displayed “O-shaped” duration response areas. In contrast to the inferior colliculus, duration tuning in the auditory cortex of M. molossus appears level tolerant. That is, the type of duration selectivity and the stimulus duration eliciting the maximum response were unaffected by changing sound level.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

The GLI1 transcription factor must maintain maximal Hedgehog pathway output in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and we have previously shown that resistant BCCs increase GLI1 deacetylation through atypical protein kinase Cι/λ (aPKC) and HDAC1. Here we identify a lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2) isoform-dependent nuclear chaperoning system that regulates GLI1 movement between the nuclear lamina and nucleoplasm to achieve maximal activation. LAP2β forms a two-site interaction with the GLI1 zinc-finger domain and acetylation site, stabilizing an acetylation-dependent reserve on the inner nuclear membrane (INM). By contrast, the nucleoplasmic LAP2α competes with LAP2β for GLI1 while scaffolding HDAC1 to deacetylate the secondary binding site. aPKC functions to promote GLI1 association with LAP2α, promoting egress off the INM. GLI1 intranuclear trafficking by LAP2 isoforms represents a powerful signal amplifier in BCCs with implications for zinc finger-based signal transduction and therapeutics.	0	Cell

"Three-dimensional gait analysis (3D-GA) is commonly used to answer clinical questions of the form ""which joints and what variables are most affected during when"". When studying high-dimensional datasets, traditional dimension reduction methods (e.g. principal components analysis) require ""data flattening"", which may make the ensuing solutions difficult to interpret. The aim of the present study is to present a case study of how a multi-dimensional dimension reduction technique, Parallel Factor 2 (PARAFAC2), provides a clinically interpretable set of solutions to typical biomechanical datasets where different variables are collected during walking and running. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data used for the present analyses came from two publicly available datasets on walking (n = 33) and running (n = 28). For each dataset, a four-dimensional array was constructed as follows: Mode A was time normalized cycle points; mode B was the number of participants multiplied by the number of speed conditions tested; mode C was the number of joint degrees of freedom, and mode D was variable (angle, velocity, moment, power). Five factors for walking and four factors for running were extracted which explained 79.23% and 84.64% of their dataset's variance. The factor which explains the greatest variance was swing-phase sagittal plane knee kinematics (walking), and kinematics and kinetics (running). Qualitatively, all extracted factors increased in magnitude with greater speed in both walking and running. This study is a proof of concept that PARAFAC2 is useful for performing dimension reduction and producing clinically interpretable solutions to guide clinical decision making."	0	Journal of biomechanics

The ability to maintain balance when turning is essential to functional and independent living. Due to the lack of neuromuscular ankle control on the prosthetic side in people with a transtibial amputation (TTA), turning is likely more challenging. The purpose of this study was to quantify how people with TTA maintain dynamic balance during 90-degree turns made with the prosthesis on the inside and outside of the turn compared to people without amputation. Eight participants with TTA and eight age-, height-, and sex- matched non-amputee controls performed left and right 90-degree step turns at a self-selected speed. The primary outcomes were range of whole-body angular momentum and positive and negative contributions of six segment groups (head/trunk, pelvis, arms, and legs) to whole-body angular momentum during the continuation stride. Participants with TTA had greater range of frontal- and sagittal-plane whole-body angular momentum when turning with the prosthesis on the inside compared controls. They also had a greater range of whole-body angular momentum in all planes of motion when turning with the prosthesis on the inside compared to outside of the turn. The contributions for the head/trunk and inside and outside legs differed between groups and turns, suggesting altered interactions between segment momenta to compensate for the reduced contribution of the amputated leg. This study provides insight into possible training paradigms to reduce the high incidence of turn related falls in people with TTA and, potentially, ways to alter prosthetic function to promote balance control.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Older adults typically demonstrate reductions in overground walking speeds and propulsive forces compared to young adults. These reductions in walking speeds are risk factors for negative health outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of an adaptive speed treadmill controller on walking speed and propulsive forces in older adults, including the mechanisms and strategies underlying any change in propulsive force between conditions. Seventeen participants completed two treadmill conditions, one with a fixed comfortable walking speed and one with an adaptive speed controller. The adaptive speed treadmill controller utilized a set of inertial-force, gait parameters, and position-based controllers that respond to an instantaneous anterior inertial force. A biomechanical-based model previously developed for individuals post-stroke was implemented for older adults to determine the primary gait parameters that contributed to the change in propulsive forces when increasing speed. Participants walked at faster average speeds during the adaptive speed controller (1.20 m/s) compared to the fixed speed controller conditions (0.98 m/s); however, these speeds were not as fast as their overground speed (1.44 m/s). Although average trailing limb angle (TLA) (p < 0.001) and ankle moment (p = 0.020) increased when speed also increased between treadmill conditions, increasing TLA contributed more to the increased propulsive forces seen during faster treadmill speeds. Our findings show that older adults chose faster walking speeds and increased propulsive force when walking on an adaptive speed treadmill compared to a fixed speed treadmill, suggesting that an adaptive speed treadmill controller has the potential to be a beneficial alternative to current exercise interventions for older adults.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Feathers are composed of a structure that, whilst being very light, is able to withstand the large aerodynamic forces exerted upon them during flight. To explore the contribution of molecular orientation to feather keratin mechanical properties, we have examined the nanoscopic organisation of the keratin molecules by X-ray diffraction techniques and have confirmed a link between this and the Young's modulus of the feather rachis. Our results indicate that along the rachis length, from calamus to tip, the keratin molecules become more aligned than at the calamus before returning to a state of higher mis-orientation towards the tip of the rachis. We have also confirmed the general trend of increasing Young's modulus with distance along the rachis. Furthermore, we report a distinct difference in the patterns of orientation of beta-keratin in the feathers of flying and flightless birds. The trend for increased modulus along the feathers of volant birds is absent in the flightless ostrich.	1	Journal of Structural Biology

The pioneering work of JZ Young described the morphological convergence of the VL with the mammalian hippocampus, cerebellum and the insect mushroom body. Studies in octopus and cuttlefish VL networks suggest evolutionary convergence into a universal organization of connectivity as a divergence-convergence (‘fan-out fan-in’) network with activity-dependent long-term plasticity mechanisms. Yet, these studies also show that the properties of the neurons, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and maintenance are highly variable among different species. This suggests that complex networks may have evolved independently multiple times and that even though memory and learning networks share similar organization and cellular processes, there are many molecular ways of constructing them.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

Despite their functional significance and links to several diseases, structural information on full-length kindlin proteins remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of human full-length kindlin-3, which reveals a novel homotrimer state. Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin β cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of kindlin auto-inhibition that involves its homotrimer formation.	0	PLoS biology

In this article, wave propagation characteristics of protein lipid nanotubules are covered with respect to scale effects utilizing nonlocal strain gradient theory. The structure is supposed to be modeled as a simply supported beam and the kinematic relations are derived based on the classical beam theory (CBT). Implementing an energy based approach, the Euler-Lagrange equations of the lipid tubules are obtained. Moreover, the final governing equations are solved analytically to achieve the wave frequency and phase velocity of propagated waves. Influences of small size and wave number on the wave dispersion responses of lipid nanotubules are shown in detail in different diagrams for both phase velocity and wave frequency. Also, accuracy of introduced model is verified comparing responses of present model with those of former papers.	0	Journal of biomechanics

New scanning electron images, spectrophotometric measurements and physical modelling are used to unveil the mechanism of this colouration switch. The visible dry-state greenish colouration originates from a widely open porous layer located 3 μm below the cuticle surface. The structure of this layer is three-dimensional, with a network of filamentary strings, arranged in layers parallel to the cuticle surface and stiffening an array of strong cylindrical pillars oriented normal to the surface. Unexpectedly, diffraction plays a significant role in the broadband colouration of the cuticle in the dry state. The backscattering caused by this layer disappears when water infiltrates the structure and weakens the refractive index differences.	1	New Journal of Physics

"Whole body digitizing used to calculate whole body center of mass (CM) variables from competitions is particularly time-consuming, and ""shortcut"" methods that substitute for it could expediate the calculation of spatiotemporal variables. The aim of this study was to measure the appropriateness of using the head as a proxy for the CM when calculating running velocity in competition. Fifty-six athletes in the IAAF World Championship marathons were recorded using two high-definition cameras (50 Hz) on two laps so that 112 running sequences were analyzed. The video files were imported into SIMI Motion and manually digitized. The horizontal running velocity during one gait cycle was obtained using four methods: horizontal velocity of the CM; horizontal velocity of the head (raw data); horizontal velocity of the head (Butterworth filtered); and horizontal displacement of the head (a single measurement using SIMI Motion 3D still image measurement) divided by time taken. In comparison with the criterion CM measurements for mean horizontal velocity, the filtered head data had the best 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.999 - 1.000), the least bias (-0.006 m/s), and the lowest root mean square difference (0.024 m/s). The filtered head condition also had the best 95% CI for ICC for maximum and minimum horizontal velocities during the stride (>0.988) and the lowest bias (-0.001 m/s and -0.003 m/s, respectively). With the application of an appropriate filter, the head is thus an excellent proxy for whole body CM velocity calculations."	0	Journal of biomechanics

Our study represents the most comprehensive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to date and will serve as a blueprint for future biological and clinical endeavors.	0	Cell

Although the critical role of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the regulation of transcription is recognized, the functions of other non-canonical DNA modifications remain obscure. Here, we report the identification of novel N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) DNA modifications in human tissues and implicate this epigenetic mark in human disease, specifically the highly malignant brain cancer glioblastoma. Glioblastoma markedly upregulated N6-mA levels, which co-localized with heterochromatic histone modifications, predominantly H3K9me3. N6-mA levels were dynamically regulated by the DNA demethylase ALKBH1, depletion of which led to transcriptional silencing of oncogenic pathways through decreasing chromatin accessibility. Targeting the N6-mA regulator ALKBH1 in patient-derived human glioblastoma models inhibited tumor cell proliferation and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, supporting this novel DNA modification as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma. Collectively, our results uncover a novel epigenetic node in cancer through the DNA modification N6-mA.	0	Cell
135	189862398	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.3000316	189862398	Protein interactions and consensus clustering analysis uncover insights into herpesvirus virion structure and function relationships	Infections with human herpesviruses are ubiquitous and a public health concern worldwide. Current treatments reduce the severity of some symptoms associated to herpetic infections but neither remove the viral reservoir from the infected host nor protect from the recurrent symptom outbreaks that characterise herpetic infections. The difficulty in therapeutically tackling these viral systems stems in part from their remarkably large proteomes and the complex networks of physical and functional associations that they tailor. This study presents our efforts to unravel the complexity of the interactome of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), the prototypical herpesvirus species. Inspired by our previous work, we present an improved and more integrative computational pipeline for the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network reconstruction in HSV1, together with a newly developed consensus clustering framework, which allowed us to extend the analysis beyond binary physical interactions and revealed a system-level layout of higher-order functional associations in the virion proteome. Additionally, the analysis provided new functional annotation for the currently undercharacterised protein pUS10. In-depth bioinformatics sequence analysis unravelled structural features in pUS10 reminiscent of those observed in some capsid-associated proteins in tailed bacteriophages, with which herpesviruses are believed to share a common ancestry. Using immunoaffinity purification (IP)–mass spectrometry (MS), we obtained additional support for our bioinformatically predicted interaction between pUS10 and the inner tegument protein pUL37, which binds cytosolic capsids, contributing to initial tegumentation and eventually virion maturation. In summary, this study unveils new, to our knowledge, insights at both the system and molecular levels that can help us better understand the complexity behind herpesvirus infections.	0	PLoS biology

The lumbar facet joint (FJ) is often associated with pathogenesis in the spine, but quantification of normal FJ motion remains limited to in vitro studies or static imaging of non-functional poses. The purpose of this study was to quantify lumbar FJ kinematics in healthy individuals during functional activity with dynamic stereo radiography (DSX) imaging. Ten asymptomatic participants lifted three known weights starting from a trunk-flexed (∼75°) position to an upright position while being imaged within the DSX system. High resolution computed tomography (CT) scan-derived 3D models of their lumbar vertebrae (L2-S1) were registered to the biplane 2D radiographs using a markerless model-based tracking technique providing instantaneous 3D vertebral kinematics throughout the lifting tasks. Effects of segment level and weight lifted were assessed using mixed-effect repeated measures ANOVA. Superior-inferior (SI) translation dominated FJ translation, with L5S1 showing significantly less translation magnitudes (Median (Md) = 3.5 mm, p < 0.0001) than L2L3, L3L4, and L4L5 segments (Md = 5.9 mm, 6.3 mm and 6.6 mm respectively). Linear regression-based slopes of continuous facet translations revealed strong linearity for SI translation (r2 > 0.94), reasonably high linearity for sideways sliding (Z-) (r2 > 0.8), but much less linearity for facet gap change (X-) (r2 ∼ 0.5). Caudal segments (L4-S1), particularly L5S1, displayed greater coupling compared to cranial (L2-L4) segments, revealing distinct differences overall in FJ translation trends at L5S1. No significant effect of weight lifted on FJ translations was detected. The study presents a hitherto unavailable and highly precise baseline dataset of facet translations measured during a functional, dynamic lifting task.	0	Journal of biomechanics
137	31557013	10.1016/J.JBIOMECH.2017.10.029	31557013	A computational model for false lumen thrombosis in type B aortic dissection following thoracic endovascular repair.	Thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) has recently been established as the preferred treatment option for complicated type B dissection. This procedure involves covering the primary entry tear to stimulate aortic remodelling and promote false lumen thrombosis thereby restoring true lumen flow. However, complications associated with incomplete false lumen thrombosis, such as aortic dilatation and stent graft induced new entry tears, can arise after TEVAR. This study presents the application and validation of a recently developed mathematical model for patient-specific prediction of thrombus formation and growth under physiologically realistic flow conditions. The model predicts thrombosis through the evaluation of shear rates, fluid residence time and platelet distribution, based on convection-diffusion-reaction transport equations. The model was applied to 3 type B aortic dissection patients: two TEVAR cases showing complete and incomplete false lumen thrombosis respectively, and one medically treated dissection with no signs of thrombosis. Predicted thrombus growth over time was validated against follow-up CT scans, showing good agreement with in vivo data in all cases with a maximum difference between predicted and measured false lumen reduction below 8%. Our results demonstrate that TEVAR-induced thrombus formation in type B aortic dissection can be predicted based on patient-specific anatomy and physiologically realistic boundary conditions. Our model can be used to identify anatomical or stent graft related factors that are associated with incomplete false lumen thrombosis following TEVAR, which may help clinicians develop personalised treatment plans for dissection patients in the future.	0	Journal of biomechanics

The nano-biomechanical environment of the extracellular matrix is critical for cells to sense and respond to mechanical loading. However, to date, this important characteristic remains poorly understood in living tissue structures. This study reports the experimental measurement of the in vivo nano-elastic modulus of the tendon in a mouse tail model. The experiment was performed on the tail tendon of an 8-week-old C57BL/6 live mouse. Mechanical loading on tail tendons was regulated by changing both voltage and frequency of alternating current stimulation on the erector spinae. The nano-elastic modulus of the tail tendon was measured by atomic force microscope. The nano-elastic modulus showed significant variation (2.19-35.70 MPa) between different locations and up to 39% decrease under muscle contraction, suggesting a complicated biomechanical environment in which cells dwell. In addition, the nano-elastic modulus of the tail tendon measured in live mice was significantly lower than that measured in vitro, suggesting a disagreement of tissue mechanical properties in vivo and in vitro. This information is important for the designs of new extracellular biomaterial that can better mimic the biological environment, and improve clinical outcomes of musculoskeletal tissue degenerations and associated disorders.	0	Journal of biomechanics
139	573641	10.1016/J.JSB.2012.04.010	573641	The C-terminal α-helix of SPAS-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans spastin homologue, is crucial for microtubule severing.	Spastin belongs to the meiotic subfamily, together with Vps4/SKD1, fidgetin and katanin, of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins, and functions in microtubule severing. Interestingly, all members of this subgroup specifically contain an additional α-helix at the very C-terminal end. To understand the function of the C-terminal α-helix, we characterised its deletion mutants of SPAS-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans spastin homologue, in vitro and in vivo. We found that the C-terminal α-helix plays essential roles in ATP binding, ATP hydrolysing and microtubule severing activities. It is likely that the C-terminal α-helix is required for cellular functions of members of meiotic subgroup of AAA proteins, since the C-terminal α-helix of Vps4 is also important for assembly, ATPase activity and in vivo function mediated by ESCRT-III complexes.	0	Journal of structural biology

Implantation of biomaterials into the body, e.g. for tissue engineering purposes, induces a material-dependent inflammatory response called the foreign body reaction (FBR). A hallmark feature of this response is the formation of large multinucleated cells: foreign body giant cells (FBGCs). Biomaterials like cross-linked and non-cross-linked collagen often induce the formation of FBGCs. It is unknown whether different biomaterials result in the formation of different FBGCs. To investigate this, we implanted cross-linked and non-cross-linked dermal sheep collagen subcutaneously in mice. After 21 days the implanted material was collected and prepared for ultrastructural analysis. More FBGCs formed on and between implants of cross-linked collagen compared to non-cross-linked material. The ultrastructural aspects of the FBGCs present on the two types of implants proved to be similar. On both materials, they formed long slender protrusions on the basolateral membrane, they were very rich in mitochondria, contained numerous nuclei, and showed signs of the presence of a clear zone facing the implanted material. Similar clear zones, that resemble osteoclastic features, were also seen in FBGCs generated in vitro on bone slices, but these cells did not form a ruffled border. However, similarities in ultrastructure such as the occurrence of slender protrusions and high mitochondrion content were also found in the FBGCs generated in vitro. These data indicate that FBGCs formed on different substrates share many morphological characteristics. The formation of long finger-like protrusions seemed typical for the FBGCs, in vivo as well as in vitro, however the function of these structures needs further analysis.	0	Journal of structural biology

The protein supply necessary for successful brood production is ensured through adjustments of the colonies’ pollen foraging according to the availability of this resource in the environment. In honey bees Apis mellifera, in addition, pollen foraging is regulated through the broods’ demand for this resource. Here, we investigated the influence of the colony’s pollen store level on pollen foraging and brood production in stingless bees (Melipona subnitida). When pollen was added to the nests, colonies increased their brood production and reduced their pollen foraging within 24 h. On the other hand, when pollen reserves were removed, colonies significantly reduced their brood production. In strong contrast to A. mellifera; however, M. subnitida did not significantly increase its pollen foraging activity under poor pollen store conditions. This difference concerning the regulation of pollen foraging may be due to differences regarding the mechanism of brood provisioning. Honey bees progressively feed young larvae and, consequently, require a constant pollen supply. Stingless bees, by contrast, mass-provision their brood cells and temporary absence of pollen storage will not immediately result in substantial brood loss.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

The present study compared neuromuscular activation, measured by surface electromyography (EMG) amplitude [measure by EMG peak (EMGPEAK)] and range of motion (ROM) where EMGPEAK occurred between two training protocols, matched by time under tension, but with a different number and duration of repetitions. Sixteen recreationally trained males performed 2 training protocols with 3 sets, 180 s of rest with 60% of one-repetition maximum(1RM) on the bench press performed in a Smith machine. Protocol A consisted of 6 repetitions with a repetition duration of 6 s and protocol B consisted of 12 repetitions with a repetition duration of 3 s. EMG activity of anterior deltoid, pectoralis major and triceps brachii muscles were recorded. The results showed a general higher EMG amplitude (regardless of the muscle) in protocol B (p = 0.010), and pectoral and triceps brachii consistently presented higher neuromuscular activation than anterior deltoid at both protocols (p = 0.007). Additionally, the ROM where EMGPEAK occurred in triceps brachii was in the middle of the concentric action (~50% of ROM), this occurred in the first half of the same action (~24% of ROM) in the other muscles. In conclusion, protocol B demonstrated an increased EMG amplitude over protocol A, although both protocols responded similarly by achieving the highest EMG amplitude at same ROM among the muscles analysed.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Diffusion-tensor MRI fiber tractography has been used to reconstruct skeletal muscle architecture, but remains a specialized technique using custom-written data processing routines. In this work, we describe the public release of a software toolbox having the following design objectives: accomplish the pre-processing tasks of file input, image registration, denoising, and diffusion-tensor calculation; allow muscle-specific methods for defining seed points; make fiber-tract architectural measurements referenced to tendinous structures; visualize fiber tracts and other muscle structures of interest; analyze the goodness of outcomes; and provide a programming structure that allows the addition of new capabilities in future versions. The proper function of the code was verified using simulated datasets. The toolbox capabilities for characterizing human muscle structure in vivo were demonstrated in a case study. These capabilities included measurements of muscle morphology; contractile and non-contractile tissue volumes; fiber-tract length, pennation angle, curvature; and the physiological cross-sectional area,. The free public release of this software is a first step in creating of a community of users who use these tools in studies of muscle physiology and biomechanics. Users may further contribute to code development. Along with simulated and actual datasets for benchmarking, these tools will further create mechanisms for enhancing scientific rigor and developing and validating new code features. Planned future developments include additional options for image pre-processing, development of a graphical user interface, analysis of architectural patterns during muscle contraction, and integration of functional imaging data.	0	Journal of biomechanics

We asked whether, as in other cricket species, females were able to analyze such a high pulse rate. In phonotaxis experiments, females failed to respond to stimuli with pulse rates substantially higher or lower than the species-typical value, demonstrating that they are indeed selective for this parameter. We also examined how pulse rate was represented by modulation in firing rate of the neuron AN1, the main carrier of information about cricket-song-like stimuli to the brain. For attractive stimuli, i.e. with high pulse rates, modulation of AN1 firing rate through time was surprisingly modest. This suggests that the brain circuits that analyze AN1 spike trains might be more sensitive to slight variations in AN1 firing rate than their counterparts in more slowly singing species.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

Echo classification is essential for bats’ everyday life; for instance, it enables bats to use acoustical landmarks for navigation and to recognize food sources from other objects. Most of the research of echo based object classification in echo-locating bats was done in the context of simple artificial objects. These objects might represent prey, flower, or fruit and are characterized by simple echoes with a single up to several reflectors. Bats, however, must also be able to use echoes that return from complex structures such as plants or other types of background. Such echoes are characterized by superpositions of many reflections that can only be described using a stochastic statistical approach. Scientists have only lately started to address the issue of complex echo classification by echo-locating bats. Some behavioral evidence showing that bats can classify complex echoes has been accumulated and several hypotheses have been suggested as to how they do so. Here, we present a first review of this data. We raise some hypotheses regarding possible interpretations of the data and point out necessary future directions that should be pursued.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

To understand this cellular diversity, we profiled tomato root cell type translatomes. Using xylem differentiation in tomato, examples of functional innovation, repurposing, and conservation of transcription factors are described, relative to the model plant Arabidopsis. Repurposing and innovation of genes are further observed within an exodermis regulatory network and illustrate its function. Comparative translatome analyses of rice, tomato, and Arabidopsis cell populations suggest increased expression conservation of root meristems compared with other homologous populations. In addition, the functions of constitutively expressed genes are more conserved than those of cell type/tissue-enriched genes. These observations suggest that higher order properties of cell type and pan-cell type regulation are evolutionarily conserved between plants and animals.	0	Cell

Here, we analyzed 575 primary and 335 metastatic biopsies across 100 patients with metastatic ccRCC, including two cases sampledat post-mortem. Metastatic competence was afforded by chromosome complexity, and we identify 9p loss as a highly selected event driving metastasis and ccRCC-related mortality (p = 0.0014). Distinct patterns of metastatic dissemination were observed, including rapid progression to multiple tissue sites seeded by primary tumors of monoclonal structure. By contrast, we observed attenuated progression in cases characterized by high primary tumor heterogeneity, with metastatic competence acquired gradually and initial progression to solitary metastasis. Finally, we observed early divergence of primitive ancestral clones and protracted latency of up to two decades as a feature of pancreatic metastases.	0	Cell

 Many individuals mount nearly identical antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. To gain insight into how the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) might evolve in response to common antibody responses, we studied mutations occurring during virus evolution in a persistently infected immunocompromised individual. We use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. We further show that affinity maturation is unimportant for wildtype virus neutralization but is critical to neutralization breadth. As the mutations we studied foreshadowed emerging variants that are now circulating across the globe, our results have implications to the long-term efficacy of S-directed countermeasures.

How a receiver’s central nervous system integrates multiple signal components remains largely unknown. We investigated how female green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) integrate the multiple spectral components present in male advertisement calls. Typical calls have a bimodal spectrum consisting of formant-like low-frequency (~0.9 kHz) and high-frequency (~2.7 kHz) components that are transduced by different sensory organs in the inner ear. In behavioral experiments, only bimodal calls reliably elicited phonotaxis in no-choice tests, and they were selectively chosen over unimodal calls in two-alternative choice tests. Single neurons in the inferior colliculus of awake, passively listening subjects were classified as combination-insensitive units (27.9%) or combination-sensitive units (72.1%) based on patterns of relative responses to the same bimodal and unimodal calls. Combination-insensitive units responded similarly to the bimodal call and one or both unimodal calls. In contrast, combination-sensitive units exhibited both linear responses (i.e., linear summation) and, more commonly, nonlinear responses (e.g., facilitation, compressive summation, or suppression) to the spectral combination in the bimodal call. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nonlinearities play potentially critical roles in spectral integration and in the neural processing of multicomponent communication signals.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology A

We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure mRNA levels of opioid peptide precursors and receptors in the brain and heart of summer ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) and winter hibernating squirrels in the torpid or interbout arousal states. The use of appropriate reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR gene expression data can have profound effects on the analysis and interpretation of results. This may be particularly important when experimental subjects, such as hibernating animals, undergo significant morphological and/or functional changes during the study. Therefore, an additional goal of this study was to identify stable reference genes for use in qRT-PCR studies of the 13-lined ground squirrel. Expression levels of 10 potential reference genes were measured in the small intestine, liver, brain, and heart, and the optimal combinations of the most stable reference genes were identified by the GeNorm Excel applet. Based on this analysis, we provide recommendations for reference genes to use in each tissue that would be suitable for comparative studies among different activity states. When appropriate normalization of mRNA levels was used, there were no changes in opioid-related genes in heart among the three activity states; in brain, DOR expression was highest during torpor, lowest in interbout arousal and intermediate in summer. The results support the idea that changes in DOR expression may regulate the level of neuronal activity in brain during the annual hibernation cycle and may contribute to hibernation-associated tissue protection.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

"As humans walk or run, external (environmental) and internal (physiological) disturbances induce variability. How humans regulate this variability from stride-to-stride can be critical to maintaining balance. One cannot infer what is ""controlled"" based on analyses of variability alone. Assessing control requires quantifying how deviations are corrected across consecutive movements. Here, we assessed walking and running, each at two speeds. We hypothesized differences in speed would drive changes in variability, while adopting different gaits would drive changes in how people regulated stepping. Ten healthy adults walked/ran on a treadmill under four conditions: walk or run at comfortable speed, and walk or run at their predicted walk-to-run transition speed. Time series of relevant stride parameters were analyzed to quantify variability and stride-to-stride error-correction dynamics within a Goal-Equivalent Manifold (GEM) framework. In all conditions, participants' stride-to-stride control respected a constant-speed GEM strategy. At each consecutively faster speed, variability tangent to the GEM increased (p ≤ 0.031), while variability perpendicular to the GEM decreased (p ≤ 0.044). There were no differences (p ≥ 0.999) between gaits at the transition speed. Differences in speed determined how stepping variability was structured, independent of gait, confirming our first hypothesis. For running versus walking, measures of GEM-relevant statistical persistence were significantly less (p ≤ 0.004), but showed minimal-to-no speed differences (0.069 ≤ p ≤ 0.718). When running, people corrected deviations both more quickly and more directly, each indicating tighter control. Thus, differences in gait determined how stride-to-stride fluctuations were regulated, independent of speed, confirming our second hypothesis."	0	Journal of biomechanics

We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.	0	PLoS biology

The migratory capacity of endothelial cells, which need intact mitochondria, is completely dependent on mitochondrial p27. Mitochondrial p27 improves mitochondrial membrane potential, increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and is required for the promigratory effect of caffeine. Domain mapping of p27 revealed that the N-terminus and C-terminus are required for those improvements. Further analysis of those regions revealed that the translocation of p27 into the mitochondria and its promigratory activity depend on serine 10 and threonine 187. In addition, mitochondrial p27 protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondrial p27 is necessary and sufficient for cardiac myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, p27 deficiency and aging decrease respiration in heart mitochondria. Caffeine does not increase respiration in p27-deficient animals, whereas aged mice display improvement after 10 days of caffeine in drinking water. Moreover, caffeine induces transcriptome changes in a p27-dependent manner, affecting mostly genes relevant for mitochondrial processes. Caffeine also reduces infarct size after myocardial infarction in prediabetic mice and increases mitochondrial p27. Our data characterize mitochondrial p27 as a common denominator that improves mitochondria-dependent processes and define an increase in mitochondrial p27 as a new mode of action of caffeine.	0	PLoS biology

However, the dynamics of these megadalton enzymatic complexes working in concert on endogenous genes have not been described. Here, we establish a quasi-genome-scale platform for observing synthesis and processing kinetics of single nascent RNA molecules in real time. We find that all observed genes show transcriptional bursting. We also observe large kinetic variation in intron removal for single introns in single cells, which is inconsistent with deterministic splice site selection. Transcriptome-wide footprinting of the U2AF complex, nascent RNA profiling, long-read sequencing, and lariat sequencing further reveal widespread stochastic recursive splicing within introns. We propose and validate a unified theoretical model to explain the general features of transcription and pervasive stochastic splice site selection.	0	Cell

Many amputees who wear a leg prosthesis develop significant skin wounds on their residual limb. The exact cause of these wounds is unclear as little work has studied the interface between the prosthetic device and user. Our research objective was to develop a quantitative method for assessing displacement patterns of the gel liner during walking for patients with transtibial amputation. Using a reflective marker system and a custom clear socket, evaluations were conducted with a clear transparent test socket mounted over a plaster limb model and a deformable limb model. Distances between markers placed on the limb were measured with a digital caliper and then compared with data from the motion capture system. Additionally, the rigid plaster set-up was moved in the capture volume to simulate walking and evaluate if inter-marker distances changed in comparison to static data. Dynamic displacement trials were then collected to measure changes in inter-marker distance due to vertical elongation of the gel liner. Static and dynamic inter-marker distances within day and across days confirmed the ability to accurately capture displacements using this new approach. These results encourage this novel method to be applied to a sample of amputee patients during walking to assess displacements and the distribution of the liner deformation within the socket. The ability to capture changes in deformation of the gel liner will provide new data that will enable clinicians and researchers to improve design and fit of the prosthesis so the incidence of pressure ulcers can be reduced.	0	Journal of biomechanics

We tested the hypothesis that noninvasive measures of cortical structure at birth mirror areal differences in cortical gene expression across gestation, and in a cohort of n = 64 preterm infants (mean age at birth = 32.0 weeks), we tested whether cortical alterations observed after preterm birth were associated with altered gene expression in specific developmental cell populations. Neonatal cortical structure was aligned to differential patterns of cell-specific gene expression in the fetal cortex. Principal component analysis (PCA) of 6 measures of cortical morphology and microstructure showed that cortical regions were ordered along a principal axis, with primary cortex clearly separated from heteromodal cortex. This axis was correlated with estimated tissue maturity, indexed by differential expression of genes expressed by progenitor cells and neurons, and engaged in stem cell differentiation, neuron migration, and forebrain development. Preterm birth was associated with altered regional MRI metrics and patterns of differential gene expression in glial cell populations. The spatial patterning of gene expression in the developing cortex was thus mirrored by regional variation in cortical morphology and microstructure at term, and this was disrupted by preterm birth. This work provides a framework to link molecular mechanisms to noninvasive measures of cortical development in early life and highlights novel pathways to injury in neonatal populations at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorder.	0	PLoS biology

"Trunk postural control (TPC) has been investigated in several populations and tasks. Previous work observed targeted training of TPC via isolated trunk control tasks may improve performance in other activities (e.g., walking). However, the nature of this relationship remains unknown. We therefore investigated the relationship between TPC, at both the global (i.e., response to finite perturbations) and local (i.e., resistance to continuous perturbations) levels, during walking and unstable sitting, both at varying levels of task demand. Thirteen individuals (11 Male, 2 Female) with no recent history (past 12 months) of illness, injury, or musculoskeletal disorders walked on a dual-belt treadmill at four speeds (-20%, -10%, +10%, and + 20% of self-selected walking speed) and completed an unstable sitting task at four levels of chair instability (100, 75, 60, and 45% of an individual's ""neutral"" stability as defined by the gravitational gradient). Three-dimensional trunk and pelvic kinematics were collected. Tri-planar Lyapunov exponents and sample entropy characterized local TPC. Global TPC was characterized by ranges of motion and, for seated trials, metrics derived from center-of-pressure time series (i.e., path length, 95% confidence ellipse area, mean velocity, and RMS position). No strong or significant correlations (-0.057 < ρ < 0.206) were observed between local TPC during walking and unstable sitting tasks. However, global TPC declined in both walking and unstable sitting as task demand increased, with a moderate inter-task relationship (0.336 < ρ < 0.544). While the mechanisms regulating local TPC are inherently different, global TPC may be similarly regulated across both tasks, supporting future translation of improvements in TPC between tasks."	0	Journal of biomechanics

We measured feeding and digestive parameters at three concentrations of detritus (0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 mm3 l−1), so that functional relationships between ingestive and digestive processes could be assessed. Increasing concentrations of detritus (food) resulted in a reduction in filtering activity (clearance rate l h−1), but an increase in ingestion rate. Consequently, gut content also increased with increasing food concentration, irrespective of food type. In contrast, the trend followed by absorption efficiency with increasing ingestion rate was determined by food type, being significantly reduced (from 0.63 to 0.11) with Juncus but remaining almost constant with the green macroalgae (0.58 ± 0.07 with Ulva) or only minimally reduced (from 0.66 to 0.48 with Enteromorpha). This differential response had clear consequences for energy uptake: absorption rate increased with increasing particulate organic matter with Enteromorpha but decreased with Juncus. We discuss the possible role of digestive parameters such as digestibility, gut content and gut-residence time in the differential utilization of detrital matter from different vegetal origins by cockles.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

Here, we show that mice deficient for ubiquitin ligase (E3) Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis as they age and exhibit the exacerbated phenotype under a high-fat diet (HFD). Our data indicate that loss of Smurf1 up-regulates the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and its target genes involved in lipid synthesis and fatty acid uptake. We further show that PPARγ is a direct substrate of Smurf1-mediated non-proteolytic lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin modification that suppresses its transcriptional activity, and treatment of Smurf1-deficient mice with a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, completely reversed the lipid accumulation in the liver. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse correlation of low SMURF1 expression to high body mass index (BMI) values in human patients, thus revealing a new role of SMURF1 in NAFLD pathogenesis.	0	PLoS biology

In this study, I compared the egg quality (egg size, albumen and yolk antioxidant capacity) and serum oxidative status (oxidative damage, total serum antioxidant capacity, and serum thiols) of female pigeons (Columba livia) fed with foods of different quality (standard quality and decreased quality). I also analysed the patterns of covariation among egg and female traits. The study focussed on the first clutch laid by the female in the breeding season and on the short-term effects of a decrease in diet quality. The treatment did not affect the egg volume, the lipophilic and hydrophilic components of antioxidant capacity (lipOXY and hydrOXY, respectively) or the antioxidant capacity of the albumen (albumOXY). However, females fed a higher quality diet were fatter and had marginally higher values of serum hydroperoxides (oxidative damage) than females fed a lower quality diet. Moreover, females that showed an increase in yolk hydrOXY and serum hydroperoxides also showed a decrease in yolk lipOXY, albumOXY and serum antioxidant capacity. These results show that the female’s oxidative status can be correlated with the antioxidant content of her eggs, but the nature of these correlations is complex, depending on the molecular component measured. The results also suggest that in the pigeon the deposition of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants in the egg may trade off against each other.	0	Journal of Comparative Physiology B

164	212751411	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.3000618	212751411	Characterization of a membrane binding loop leads to engineering botulinum neurotoxin B with improved therapeutic efficacy	Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a family of bacterial toxins with seven major serotypes (BoNT/A–G). The ability of these toxins to target and bind to motor nerve terminals is a key factor determining their potency and efficacy. Among these toxins, BoNT/B is one of the two types approved for medical and cosmetic uses. Besides binding to well-established receptors, an extended loop in the C-terminal receptor-binding domain (HC) of BoNT/B (HC/B) has been proposed to also contribute to toxin binding to neurons by interacting with lipid membranes (termed lipid-binding loop [LBL]). Analogous loops exist in the HCs of BoNT/C, D, G, and a chimeric toxin DC. However, it has been challenging to detect and characterize binding of LBLs to lipid membranes. Here, using the nanodisc system and biolayer interferometry assays, we find that HC/DC, C, and G, but not HC/B and HC/D, are capable of binding to receptor-free lipids directly, with HC/DC having the highest level of binding. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate the critical role of consecutive aromatic residues at the tip of the LBL for binding of HC/DC to lipid membranes. Taking advantage of this insight, we then create a “gain-of-function” mutant HC/B by replacing two nonaromatic residues at the tip of its LBL with tryptophan. Cocrystallization studies confirm that these two tryptophan residues do not alter the structure of HC/B or the interactions with its receptors. Such a mutated HC/B gains the ability to bind receptor-free lipid membranes and shows enhanced binding to cultured neurons. Finally, full-length BoNT/B containing two tryptophan mutations in its LBL, together with two additional mutations (E1191M/S1199Y) that increase binding to human receptors, is produced and evaluated in mice in vivo using Digit Abduction Score assays. This mutant toxin shows enhanced efficacy in paralyzing local muscles at the injection site and lower systemic diffusion, thus extending both safety range and duration of paralysis compared with the control BoNT/B. These findings establish a mechanistic understanding of LBL–lipid interactions and create a modified BoNT/B with improved therapeutic efficacy.	0	PLoS biology

166	4482795	10.1016/J.JBIOMECH.2018.02.004	4482795	A comparison of methods to determine center of mass during pregnancy.	Balance changes during pregnancy likely occur because of mass gains and mass distribution changes. However, to date there is no way of tracking balance through center of mass motion because no method is available to identify of the body center of mass throughout pregnancy. We compared methods for determining segment masses and torso center of mass location. The availability of a method for tracking these changes during pregnancy will make determining balance changes through center of mass motion an option for future pregnancy balance research. Thirty pregnant women from eight weeks gestation until birth were recruited for monthly anthropometric measurements, motion capture analysis of body segment locations, and force plate analysis of center of pressure during quiet standing and supine laying. From these measurements, we were able to compare regression, volume measurement, and weighted sum methods to calculate body center of mass throughout pregnancy. We found that mass changes around the trunk were most prevalent as expected, but mass changes throughout the body (especially the thighs) were also seen. Our findings also suggest that a series of anthropometric measurements first suggested by Pavol et al. (2002), in combination with quiet standing on a force plate, can be used to identify the needed components (segment masses and torso center of mass location in three dimensions) to calculate body center of mass changes during pregnancy. The results of this study will make tracking of center of mass motion a possibility for future pregnancy balance research.	0	Journal of biomechanics

D. pulchra and 4 other co-occurring seaweeds were almost exclusively fouled by other algae. Consequently, we carried out laboratory assays using propagules from 4 fouling algae (Ulva sp., Ceramium sp., Polysiphonia sp. and Ectocarpus siliculosis) representing the natural fouling community. The crude surface extract of D. pulchra at the same concentration as on the surface of the plant, the furanone fraction of this extract, and pure furnaones, deterred the settlement of fouling organisms in ecologically relevant assays. These data, coupled with knowledge of the surface concentration of furanones on D. pulchra and a mechanism by which furanones are sequestered onto the surface of the plant, provide a rigorous demonstration of chemically mediated antifouling.	1	Marine Ecology Progress Series

The impact of this aggregation process and its specific properties are unknown. We first show that aggregative properties are necessary for efficient infection and study their underlying physical mechanisms. Micropipette aspiration and single-cell tracking unravel unique features of an atypical fluidized phase, with single-cell diffusion exceeding that of isolated cells. A quantitative description of the bacterial pair interactions combined with active matter physics-based modeling show that this behavior relies on type IV pili active dynamics that mediate alternating phases of bacteria fast mutual approach, contact, and release. These peculiar fluid properties proved necessary to adjust to the geometry of capillaries upon bacterial proliferation. Intermittent attractive forces thus generate a fluidized phase that allows for efficient colonization of the blood capillary network during infection.	0	Cell

Crickets can locate conspecifics by phonotaxis to the calling (mating) song they produce, and can evade bats by negative phonotaxis from echolocation calls. The behaviour and underlying physiology have been studied in some depth, and the auditory system solves this complex problem in a unique manner. Experiments conducted on a simulation model of the system indicated that the mechanism output a directional signal to sounds ahead at calling song frequency and to sounds behind at echolocation frequencies. We suggest that this combination of responses helps simplify later processing in the cricket. To further explore this result, an analogue, very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit model of the mechanism was designed and built; results from testing this agreed with the simulation. The aVLSI circuit was used to test a further hypothesis about the potential advantages of the positioning of the acoustic inputs for sound localisation during walking. There was no clear advantage to the directionality of the system in their location. The aVLSI circuitry is now being extended to use on a robot along with previously modelled neural circuitry to better understand the complete sensorimotor pathway.	1	BioSystems

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deconvolves cell types from gene expression, but no technology links cell identity to TF binding sites (TFBS) in those cell types. We present self-reporting transposons (SRTs) and use them in single-cell calling cards (scCC), a novel assay for simultaneously measuring gene expression and mapping TFBS in single cells. The genomic locations of SRTs are recovered from mRNA, and SRTs deposited by exogenous, TF-transposase fusions can be used to map TFBS. We then present scCC, which map SRTs from scRNA-seq libraries, simultaneously identifying cell types and TFBS in those same cells. We benchmark multiple TFs with this technique. Next, we use scCC to discover BRD4-mediated cell-state transitions in K562 cells. Finally, we map BRD4 binding sites in the mouse cortex at single-cell resolution, establishing a new method for studying TF biology in situ.	0	Cell

Concordant shifts of visual features suggest movements of the observer, whereas discordant changes are more likely to be indicating independently moving objects, such as predators or prey. Such distinction helps us to focus attention, adapt our behavior, and adjust our motor patterns to meet behavioral challenges. However, the neural basis of distinguishing self-induced and self-independent visual motions is not clarified in unrestrained animals yet. In this study, we investigated the presence and origin of motion-related visual information in the striatum of rats, a hub of action selection and procedural memory. We found that while almost half of the neurons in the dorsomedial striatum are sensitive to visual motion congruent with locomotion (and that many of them also code for spatial location), only a small subset of them are composed of fast-firing interneurons that could also perceive self-independent visual stimuli. These latter cells receive their visual input at least partially from the secondary visual cortex (V2). This differential visual sensitivity may be an important support in adjusting behavior to salient environmental events. It emphasizes the importance of investigating visual motion perception in unrestrained animals.	0	PLoS biology

We combined genetically targeted voltage imaging with optogenetic activation and silencing to study the mechanisms underlying sensory processing in mouse barrel cortex L1. Whisker stimuli evoked precisely timed single spikes in L1 interneurons, followed by strong lateral inhibition. A mild aversive stimulus activated cholinergic inputs and evoked a bimodal distribution of spiking responses in L1. A simple conductance-based model that only contained lateral inhibition within L1 recapitulated the sensory responses and the winner-takes-all cholinergic responses, and the model correctly predicted that the network would function as a spatial and temporal high-pass filter for excitatory inputs. Our results demonstrate that all-optical electrophysiology can reveal basic principles of neural circuit function in vivo and suggest an intuitive picture for how L1 transforms sensory and modulatory inputs.	0	Cell

Using activity-dependent labeling and gene expression profiling, we identified pIII neurons that promote non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Optrode recording showed that pIII glutamatergic neurons expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide alpha (CALCA) are NREM-sleep active; optogenetic and chemogenetic activation/inactivation showed that they strongly promote NREM sleep. Within the pIII region, CALCA neurons form reciprocal connections with another population of glutamatergic neurons that express the peptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Activation of CCK neurons also promoted NREM sleep. Both CALCA and CCK neurons project rostrally to the preoptic hypothalamus, whereas CALCA neurons also project caudally to the posterior ventromedial medulla. Activation of each projection increased NREM sleep. Together, these findings point to the pIII region as an excitatory sleep center where different subsets of glutamatergic neurons promote NREM sleep through both local reciprocal connections and long-range projections.	0	Cell

In particular, host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence may have distinct temperature dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics. Using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite, we fitted a mechanistic model of the within-host parasite population dynamics. Model parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance, were specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. Our results serve as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host–parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level.	0	PLoS biology

It has been shown for developing enamel and zebrafish fin that hydroxyapatite (HA) is preceded by an amorphous precursor, motivating us to examine the mineral development in mammalian bone, particularly femur and tibia of fetal and young mice. Mineral particle thickness and arrangement were characterized by (synchrotron) small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) combined with wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. Simultaneous measurements of the local calcium content and the HA content via XRF and WAXD, respectively, revealed the total calcium contained in HA crystals. Interestingly, bones of fetal as well as newborn mice contained a certain fraction of calcium which is not part of the HA crystals. Mineral deposition could be first detected in fetal tibia at day 16.5 by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). SAXS revealed a complete lack of orientation in the mineral particles at this stage, whereas 1day after birth particles were predominantly aligned parallel to the longitudinal bone axis, with the highest degree of alignment in the midshaft. Moreover, we found that mineral particle length increased with age as well as the thickness, while fetal particles were thicker but much shorter. In summary, this study revealed strong differences in size and orientation of the mineral particles between fetal and postnatal bone, with bulkier, randomly oriented particles at the fetal stage, and highly aligned, much longer particles after birth. Moreover, a part of the calcium seems to be present in other form than HA at all stages of development.	0	Journal of structural biology

The cartilaginous endoskeletons of elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) are reinforced superficially by minute, mineralized tiles, called tesserae. Unlike the bony skeletons of other vertebrates, elasmobranch skeletons have limited healing capability and their tissues' mechanisms for avoiding damage or managing it when it does occur are largely unknown. Here we describe an aberrant type of mineralized elasmobranch skeletal tissue called endophytic masses (EPMs), which grow into the uncalcified cartilage of the skeleton, but exhibit a strikingly different morphology compared to tesserae and other elasmobranch calcified tissues. We use materials and biological tissue characterization techniques, including computed tomography, electron and light microscopy, X-ray and Raman spectroscopy and histology to characterize the morphology, ultrastructure and chemical composition of tesserae-associated EPMs in different elasmobranch species. EPMs appear to develop between and in intimate association with tesserae, but lack the lines of periodic growth and varying mineral density characteristic of tesserae. EPMs are mineral-dominated (high mineral and low organic content), comprised of birefringent bundles of large calcium phosphate crystals (likely brushite) aligned end to end in long strings. Both tesserae and EPMs appear to develop in a type-2 collagen-based matrix, but in contrast to tesserae, all chondrocytes embedded or in contact with EPMs are dead and mineralized. The differences outlined between EPMs and tesserae demonstrate them to be distinct tissues. We discuss several possible reasons for EPM development, including tissue reinforcement, repair, and disruptions of mineralization processes, within the context of elasmobranch skeletal biology as well as damage responses of other vertebrate mineralized tissues.	0	Journal of structural biology

The current study proposes a new method to predict the body shape and mass distribution of the trunk (Tl-L5) of a human male using 15 anthropometric measurements acquired at various locations of the body. Trunk cross-sectional images adopted from the Visible Human male project database were segmented into fat, bone, and lean tissue. Assuming that all male subjects have similar cross-sectional composition at a given body height percentile, areas of the segmented cross-sectional images of the Visible Human male along the trunk were scaled to match those of the predicted body shape. The trunk mass distribution of the target subject can then be computed using the density values of fat, bone, and lean tissue. Comparison of the predicted body shape circumference with ground truth values measured using digital and actual measurements yielded maximum mean error of 13.3 mm and 30.3 mm, respectively. The accuracy of the image segmentation was evaluated, and the results showed a high Jaccard index (>0.95). The proposed method was able to predict the trunk mass distribution of two volunteers with a maximum deviation of 384 g at T4 level and a minimum deviation of 12 g at L4 level and the corresponding centers of mass fell within the experimental data at most levels. Thus, our method can be considered as a feasible option to calculate subject-specific trunk mass distribution.	0	Journal of biomechanics

Arrestins have important roles in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling including desensitization of GPCRs and G protein-independent signaling. Two major intra-molecular interactions, the polar core and the three-element region, maintain arrestins in the basal conformation by connecting the N- and C-domains. Mutations in these regions that disrupt the polar core (R169E or p44) or the three-element (3A) have been reported to interact with GPCRs in a phosphorylation-independent manner, and thus these mutants are referred to as pre-activated arrestins. On the other hand, deletion of 7 residues in the linker region between N- and C-domains (Δ7) freezes arrestins in the inactive state, which has a much lower binding affinity to GPCRs compared to the wild type form. Although these mutants are widely used for functional studies of arrestins, the conformations of these mutants have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed the conformational dynamics of β-arrestin1 with various mutants (R169E, p44, 3A, and Δ7) by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). HDX-MS data revealed that pre-activated mutants have more deuterium uptake than the basal state, and also that the regions and degree of increased deuterium uptake differ between pre-activated mutants. Unexpectedly, the inactive mutant also showed increased deuterium uptake in a few regions.	0	Journal of structural biology

 Viruses are a constant threat to global health as highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, lack of data underlying how the human host interacts with viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limits effective therapeutic intervention. We introduce Viral-Track, a computational method that globally scans unmapped scRNA-seq data for the presence of viral RNA, enabling transcriptional cell sorting of infected versus bystander cells. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of Viral-Track to systematically detect viruses from multiple models of infection, including hepatitis B virus in an unsupervised manner. Applying Viral-Track to Bronchoalveloar-Lavage samples from severe and mild COVID-19 patients reveals a dramatic impact of the virus on the immune system of severe patients compared to mild cases. Viral-Track detects an unexpected co-infection of the human MetaPneumoVirus, present mainly in monocytes perturbed in type-I IFN-signaling. Viral-Track provides a robust technology for dissecting the mechanisms of viral-infection and pathology.

186	233351748	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.3001211	233351748	Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose	Two of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently approved in the United States require 2 doses, administered 3 to 4 weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the emergence of highly contagious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose or to continue with the recommended 2-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these 2 vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the level of preexisting immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an additional 17.3 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 7.8–29.7) infections, 0.69 (95% CrI: 0.52–0.97) hospitalizations, and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25–0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the 2 doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.60 (95% CrI: 0.37–0.89) hospitalizations and 0.32 (95% CrI: 0.23–0.45) deaths per 10,000 population in a 9-week delayed second dose (DSD) strategy compared to the 3-week recommended schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the characteristics and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal time interval between the 2 doses.	0	PLoS biology

Sticholysin I (StI) is a toxin produced by the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus and belonging to the actinoporins family. Upon binding to sphingomyelin-containing membranes StI forms oligomeric pores, thereby leading to cell death. According to recent controversial experimental evidences, the pore architecture of actinoporins is a debated topic. Here, we investigated the StI topology in membranes by site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results reveal that StI in membrane exhibits an oligomeric architecture with heterogeneous stoichiometry of predominantly eight or nine protomers, according to the available structural models. The StI topology resembles the conic pore structure reported for the actinoporin fragaceatoxin C. Our data show that StI coexists in two membrane-associated conformations, with the N-terminal segment either attached to the protein core or inserted in the membrane forming the pore. This finding suggests a 'pre-pore' to 'pore' transition determined by a conformational change that detaches the N-terminal segment.	0	Journal of structural biology

Polyamines are essential in all branches of life. Biosynthesis of spermidine, one of the most ubiquitous polyamines, is catalyzed by spermidine synthase (SpeE). Although the function of this enzyme from Escherichia coli has been thoroughly characterised, its structural details remain unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of E. coli SpeE and study its interaction with the ligands by isothermal titration calorimetry and computational modelling. SpeE consists of two domains - a small N-terminal beta-strand domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that adopts a canonical methyltransferase (MTase) Rossmann fold. The protein forms a dimer in the crystal and in solution. Structural comparison of E. coli SpeE to its homologs reveals that it has a large and unique substrate-binding cleft that may account for its lower amine substrate specificity.	0	Journal of structural biology
190	14692058	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2001633	14692058	Seven Glimpses into the Emotional Brain	In the last century, and particularly since the 1950’s, we’ve witnessed a shift in our efforts to understand the human mind. Cognition—the term that includes mental processes such as attention, memory, problem-solving, planning, and language—stopped being exclusively a philosophical subject approached by introspection and became a matter of empirical investigation and objective quantification. However, the traditional approaches to study cognition have focused on the information-processing functions and have generally excluded emotions. Today researchers acknowledge a close relationship between our feelings and our thoughts, and have begun to disentangle how this relationship affects how we view the world, what we learn from it, and how we adjust our behavior accordingly. In this short article, I summarize recent research published in Open Access journals that explores the quantification and manipulation of emotions and investigates the interactions between emotions and cognitive processes such as attention and memory. This work provides insights from human subjects and animal models on the underlying neural mechanisms of cognition. In a recent study published in PLOS Biology [1], the authors investigated how emotions impact visual attention. To do so, they used a combination of psychophysical experiments and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. When human subjects were shown emotionally loaded stimuli, the size of the attention field changed depending on whether the stimuli had a positive or negative valence. For example, a smiling face has a positive valence, and when presented to the subject, their attention field broadened. However, when the subjects were presented with a face with a negative valence (frowning or angry), the subject’s attention field narrowed. Interestingly, the emotional strength of the negative or positive faces, as explicitly reported by the participants, closely matched the size of the effects in the behavioral and brain-imaging experiments. The authors could establish that the effects of emotional valence on the size of the attention fields were mediated by a feedback from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—a functional brain structure that contributes to executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, and abstract reasoning—to the primary visual cortex. These findings pave the road for understanding how the interaction between emotion and attention shapes our experience of the world. In a complementary study published in PLOS Computational Biology [2], researchers explored additional neural mechanisms that could account for the emotional regulation of attention. The scientists developed a computational model to investigate how the amygdala— the gateway of the brain’s emotional system—controls the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus, which is central to the attentional system. Lesions in the thalamic reticular nucleus, for example, result in attentional deficits. The computational model indicates that the amygdala-thalamic reticular nucleus pathway can select emotionally salient stimuli and inhibit transmission of irrelevant signals to the cortex, thereby determining the information available for subsequent cortical processing. In this way, the model accounts for both flexible bottomup and focused top-down attention guided by emotions. Bottom-up (or stimulus-driven)	0	PLoS biology

Ciliated preadipocytes abundantly populate perivascular compartments in fat and are activated by a high-fat diet. Here, we sought to understand whether preadipocytes use their cilia to sense and respond to external cues to remodel white adipose tissue. Abolishing preadipocyte cilia in mice severely impairs white adipose tissue expansion. We discover that TULP3-dependent ciliary localization of the omega-3 fatty acid receptor FFAR4/GPR120 promotes adipogenesis. FFAR4 agonists and ω-3 fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids, trigger mitosis and adipogenesis by rapidly activating cAMP production inside cilia. Ciliary cAMP activates EPAC signaling, CTCF-dependent chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional activation of PPARγ and CEBPα to initiate adipogenesis. We propose that dietary ω-3 fatty acids selectively drive expansion of adipocyte numbers to produce new fat cells and store saturated fatty acids, enabling homeostasis of healthy fat tissue.	0	Cell
192	42738119	10.1016/J.JSB.2010.09.001	42738119	The elusive π-helix.	Central to protein architecture is the local arrangement or secondary structure of the polypeptide backbone. Thirty to forty percent of protein domains are α-helices with 3.6 residues per turn. π-Helices, in which the peptide chain is more loosely coiled (4.4 residues per turn), have also been proposed. However, such structures necessitate an energetically unfavorable ∼1Å central helical hole. We show that rather than being composed of idealized π-helices, helical regions formed from putative π-helices actually consist of a series of concatenated wide turns with unique elliptical configurations. These structures have a larger helical radius akin to that of a π-helix, but without the loss of favorable cross-core van der Waals interactions. This not only obviates the helical void, but also endows proteins with important functionalities, including metal ion coordination, enhanced flexibility and specific enzyme-substrate binding interactions.	0	Journal of structural biology
193	4990960	10.1371/JOURNAL.PBIO.2004979	4990960	Unconventional function of an Achaete-Scute homolog as a terminal selector of nociceptive neuron identity	Proneural genes are among the most early-acting genes in nervous system development, instructing blast cells to commit to a neuronal fate. Drosophila Atonal and Achaete-Scute complex (AS-C) genes, as well as their vertebrate orthologs, are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with such proneural activity. We show here that a C. elegans AS-C homolog, hlh-4, functions in a fundamentally different manner. In the embryonic, larval, and adult nervous systems, hlh-4 is expressed exclusively in a single nociceptive neuron class, ADL, and its expression in ADL is maintained via transcriptional autoregulation throughout the life of the animal. However, in hlh-4 null mutants, the ADL neuron is generated and still appears neuronal in overall morphology and expression of panneuronal and pansensory features. Rather than acting as a proneural gene, we find that hlh-4 is required for the ADL neuron to function properly, to adopt its correct morphology, to express its unusually large repertoire of olfactory receptor–encoding genes, and to express other known features of terminal ADL identity, including neurotransmitter phenotype, neuropeptides, ion channels, and electrical synapse proteins. hlh-4 is sufficient to induce ADL identity features upon ectopic expression in other neuron types. The expression of ADL terminal identity features is directly controlled by HLH-4 via a phylogenetically conserved E-box motif, which, through bioinformatic analysis, we find to constitute a predictive feature of ADL-expressed terminal identity markers. The lineage that produces the ADL neuron was previously shown to require the conventional, transient proneural activity of another AS-C homolog, hlh-14, demonstrating sequential activities of distinct AS-C-type bHLH genes in neuronal specification. Taken together, we have defined here an unconventional function of an AS-C-type bHLH gene as a terminal selector of neuronal identity and we speculate that such function could be reflective of an ancestral function of an “ur-” bHLH gene.	0	PLoS biology

By 2050 the proportion of over 65s is predicted to be 20% of the population. The consequences of an age-related reduction in muscle mass have not been fully investigated and, therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the muscle and joint contact forces using musculoskeletal modelling, during a sit-to-stand activity, to better explain difficulties in performing everyday activities for older people. A sit-to-stand activity with and without the use of arm rests was observed in ninety-five male participants, placed into groups of young (aged 18-35 years), middle-aged (aged 40-60 years) or older adults (aged 65 years and over). Older participants demonstrated significantly lower knee extensor and joint forces than the young when not using arm rests, compensating through elevated hip extensor and ankle plantarflexor muscle activity. The older group were also found to have higher shoulder joint contact forces whilst using arm rests. This tendency to reorganise muscle recruitment to include neighbouring groups or other parts of the body could make everyday activities more susceptible to age-related functional decline. Reductions in leg strength, via age- or atrophy- related means, creates increased reliance on the upper body and may result in further lower limb atrophy through disuse. The eventual decline of upper body function reduces strength reserves, leading to increased vulnerability, dependence on others and risk of institutionalisation.	0	Journal of biomechanics

"In-vitro biomechanical testing is widely performed for characterizing the load-displacement characteristics of intact, injured, degenerated, and surgically repaired osteoligamentous spine specimens. Traditional specimen fixture devices offer an unspecified rigidity of fixation, while varying in the associated amounts and reversibility of damage to and ""coverage"" of a specimen - factors that can limit surgical access to structures of interest during testing as well as preclude the possibility of testing certain segments of a specimen. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a specimen fixture system for spine biomechanical testing that uses components of clinically available spinal fixation hardware and determine whether the new system provides sufficient rigidity for spine biomechanical testing. Custom testing blocks were mounted into a robotic testing system and the angular deflection of the upper fixture was measured indirectly using linear variable differential transformers. The fixture system had an overall stiffness 37.0, 16.7 and 13.3 times greater than a typical human functional spine unit for the flexion/extension, axial rotation and lateral bending directions respectively - sufficient rigidity for biomechanical testing. Fixture motion when mounted to a lumbar spine specimen revealed average motion of 0.6, 0.6, and 1.5° in each direction. This specimen fixture method causes only minimal damage to a specimen, permits testing of all levels of a specimen, and provides for surgical access during testing."	0	Journal of biomechanics

The mineralized extracellular matrix of bone is an organic-inorganic nanocomposite consisting primarily of carbonated hydroxyapatite, fibrous type I collagen, noncollagenous proteins and small proteoglycans, along with diverse biomolecules such as pyrophosphate and citrate. While much is now known about the mineralization-regulating role of pyrophosphate, less is known about the function of citrate. In order to assess the effect of negatively charged citrate on collagen mineralization, citrate-functionalized, bone osteoid-mimicking dense collagen gels were exposed to simulated body fluid for up to 7 days to examine the multiscale evolution of intra- and interfibrillar collagen mineralization. Here, we show by increases in methylene blue staining that the net negative charge of collagen can be substantially augmented through citrate functionalization. Structural and compositional analyses by transmission and scanning electron (including X-ray microanalysis and electron diffraction) and atomic force microscopy, all demonstrated that citrate-functionalized collagen fibrils underwent extensive intrafibrillar mineralization within 12 hours in simulated body fluid. Time-resolved, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the temporal evolution of intrafibrillar mineralization of single collagen fibrils. Longer exposure to simulated body fluid resulted in additional interfibrillar mineralization, all through an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation towards apatite (assessed by X-ray diffraction and attenuated total reflection-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy). Calcium deposition assays indicated a citrate concentration-dependent temporal increase in mineralization, and micro-computed tomography confirmed that >80 vol% of the collagen in the gels was mineralized by day 7. In conclusion, citrate effectively induces mesoscale intra- and interfibrillar collagen mineralization, a finding that advances our understanding of the role of citrate in mineralized tissues.	0	Journal of structural biology

Conventional ubiquitination is catalyzed by the universally conserved E1-E2-E3 three-enzyme cascade in an ATP-dependent manner. The newly identified SidE family effectors of the pathogen Legionella pneumophila ubiquitinate several human proteins by a different mechanism without engaging any of the conventional ubiquitination machinery. We now report the crystal structures of SidE alone and in complex with ubiquitin, NAD, and ADP-ribose, thereby capturing different conformations of SidE before and after ubiquitin and ligand binding. The structures of ubiquitin bound to both mART and PDE domains reveal several unique features of the two reaction steps catalyzed by SidE. Further, the structural and biochemical results demonstrate that SidE family members do not recognize specific structural folds of the substrate proteins. Our studies provide both structural explanations for the functional observations and new insights into the molecular mechanisms of this non-canonical ubiquitination machinery.	0	Cell
198	4662400	10.1111/J.1095-8312.1993.TB00896.X	4662400	Lung ventilation in salamanders and the evolution of vertebrate air-breathing mechanisms	Abstract Functional analysis of lung ventilation in salamanders combined with historical analysis of respiratory pumps provides new perspectives on the evolution of breathing mechanisms in vertebrates. Lung ventilation in the aquatic salamander Necturus maculosus was examined by means of cineradiography, measurement of buccal and pleuroperitoneal cavity pressures, and electromyography of hypaxial musculature. In deoxygenated water Necturus periodically rises to the surface, opens its mouth, expands its buccal cavity to draw in fresh air, exhales air from the lungs, closes its mouth, and then compresses its buccal cavity and pumps air into the lungs. Thus Necturus produces only two buccal movements per breath: one expansion and one compression. Necturus shares the use of this two-stroke buccal pump with lungfishes, frogs and other salamanders. The ubiquitous use of this system by basal sarcopterygians is evidence that a two-stroke buccal pump is the primitive lung ventilation mechanism for sarcopterygian vertebrates. In contrast, basal actinopterygian fishes use a four-stroke buccal pump. In these fishes the buccal cavity expands to fill with expired air, compresses to expel the pulmonary air, expands to fill with fresh air, and then compresses for a second time to pump air into the lungs. Whether the sarcopterygian two-stroke buccal pump and the actinopterygian four-stroke buccal pump arose independently, whether both are derived from a single, primitive osteichthyian breathing mechanism, or whether one might be the primitive pattern and the other derived, cannot be determined Although Necturus and lungfishes both use a two-stroke buccal pump, they differ in their expiration mechanics. Unlike a lungfish (Protopterus), Necturus exhales by contracting a portion of its hypaxial trunk musculature (the m. transversus abdominis) to increase pleuroperitoneal pressure. The occurrence of this same expiratory mechanism in amniotes is evidence that the use of hypaxial musculature for expiration, but not for inspiration, is a primitive tetrapod feature. From this observation we hypothesize that aspiration breathing may have evolved in two stages: initially, from pure buccal pumping to the use of trunk musculature for exhalation but not for inspiration (as in Necturus); and secondarily, to the use of trunk musculature for both exhalation and inhalation by costal aspiration (as in amniotes).	1	Biological Journal of The Linnean Society

We used image-processing techniques to determine the moment (i.e., image frame) of the Achilles tendon (AT) rupture in an Olympic sprinter. This report may be unique due to the difficulty in conducting motion capture analyses during injury events. Our report includes one female Olympic sprinter, 29 years old (body mass: 56 kg, height: 1.68 m, and body mass index: 19.8 kg/m2) with a high-competitive profile history (2008 and 2012 Olympic Games participation; South American record holder in 100- and 200-m; Pan-American gold medalist in 200-m and 4 × 100-m relay) who suffered a complete AT rupture in the left leg while exercising in the final phase of rehabilitation following an Achilles tendinopathy in the contralateral limb. The greater dorsiflexion found at the moment of the injury and the delayed control of heel position indicated the presence of uncontrolled dorsiflexion, which potentially generated excessive eccentric stress over the tendon and, thus, the AT rupture. Here we discuss the relevance of lower leg alignment, the movements' characteristics, and the history of Achilles tendinopathy in the contralateral leg on the occurrence of the AT rupture.	0	Journal of biomechanics
