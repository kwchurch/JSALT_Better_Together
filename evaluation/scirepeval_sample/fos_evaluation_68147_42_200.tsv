0	28608961	28608961	The Inductrack: a simpler approach to magnetic levitation	Arising out of research at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on passive magnetic bearings, a new magnetic levitation system, the Inductrack, has been developed and tested at model scale. The system employs special arrays of permanent magnets (Halbach arrays) on the moving car. The magnetic field from the arrays induces repelling currents in a close-packed array of shorted circuits in the track. Above a low transition speed (a few kilometers per hour), levitation forces approach a constant value, while drag forces decrease inversely with speed, with L/D reaching 200:1 or more at operating speeds. The high magnetic efficiency of the Halbach arrays, plus the use of close-packed track circuits, results in levitating forces approaching 40 metric tonnes per square meter (using NdFeB permanent magnet arrays, whose weight in typical cases is a few percent of the levitated weight). The system is passively stable: only motion is required for levitation. Failure of the drive system only results in the train slowing down and settling onto auxiliary wheels at a low speed. A detailed theoretical analysis of the Inductrack was made, on the basis of which a small-scale model was constructed and operated. The Laboratory is building a new small-scale model system (under NASA sponsorship) to demonstrate the acceleration rates and speeds (10-g and Mach 0.4 in the model) needed to magnetically launch rockets.

2	5178705	5178705	Online Stochastic Optimization under Correlated Bandit Feedback	In this paper we consider the problem of online stochastic optimization of a locally smooth function under bandit feedback. We introduce the high-confidence tree (HCT) algorithm, a novel anytime χ-armed bandit algorithm, and derive regret bounds matching the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the dependency on number of steps and the near-optimality dimension. The main advantage of HCT is that it handles the challenging case of correlated bandit feedback (reward), whereas existing methods require rewards to be conditionally independent. HCT also improves on the state-of-the-art in terms of the memory requirement, as well as requiring a weaker smoothness assumption on the mean-reward function in comparison with the existing anytime algorithms. Finally, we discuss how HCT can be applied to the problem of policy search in reinforcement learning and we report preliminary empirical results.	[5]	['Computer science']

PAHs were analyzed in bottom sediments collected in the vicinity of a multiwell platform in {approximately} 25 m of water, where six wells had been drilled between May 1982 and November 1985. The most elevated PAH concentrations were restricted to within 25 m of the platform discharge point. Mean PAH concentrations for two samplings at 10 and 25 m from the platform were 494 {plus minus} 251 and 757 {plus minus} 1,820 ppb, respectively. The contaminated platform sites ({le} 25 m distant) were dominated by two-ring aromatics while the estuarine/bay and noncontaminated coastal sites were dominated by four- and five-ring aromatic hydrocarbons. Phenanthrene/anthracene ratios suggest a petroleum source for the hydrocarbons at platform stations and pyrolytic sources for the bay/estuarine hydrocarbons.	[9]	['Environmental science']

In this paper, the forementioned analysis is carried out for continuous wavelet transform. The analysis of the scalogram as the instantaneous frequency estimator is performed for any FM signal regardless of the mother wavelet. Accurate expressions for the bias and the variance of the estimator are derived, and reveal that the bias and the variance are signal dependent. Results are statistically confirmed through the numerical analysis for several mother wavelets, and among considered wavelets, the Morlet wavelet produces the smallest estimation error. Furthermore, the performance of the IF estimator based on the scalogram and the spectrogram were compared through analysis of mean square error. These results showed that the scalogram with the Morlet wavelet exhibited good performance for the sample linear FM signal and the sample hyperbolic FM signal in comparison to the spectrogram.

Compliance is primarily related to extracellular matrix deposition, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4Hs) plays a critical role in the synthesis of the matrix. To study the alteration of P4Hs, under the influence of variable hydrostatic pressure, a novel pressure device was used to expose human bladder smooth muscle cells (HBSMC) and fibroblasts (HBF) to pressures in the physiologic range. We then studied acute obstructed porcine bladder tissues to see if changes can also be seen after in-vitro obstruction.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
HBSMC and HBF were exposed to pressures at 0, 20 and 40 cmH(2)O for up to 72 h. In-vivo studies were carried out next, using six normal (control) and five obstructed porcine bladders. Pigs were exposed to a consistent hydrostatic pressure of < or =20 cm for 24 h after ligation of the urethra. We used 2-DE to compare protein profiling of HBSMC under normal and increased pressures. Other analyses were used to detect molecular alteration and altered expression of mRNA for P4Hs.


RESULTS
We identified 437 proteins from 476 spots (91.8%) obtained from HBSMC that were differentially expressed under normal and increased pressures. Under increased pressure, 48 unique proteins were significantly increased or decreased, and a prominent protein regulating extracellular matrix synthesis highly correlated with P4Hs. The exposure of both HBSMC and HBF to a sustained hydrostatic pressure resulted in the increased expression of P4Hs in a time- and pressure-dependent manner. In vivo, P4Hs expression was also significantly increased in the obstructed group.


CONCLUSIONS
P4Hs is up-regulated, in the human bladder, time and pressure dependently. The alteration of P4Hs over a short period may significantly influence the synthesis of extracellular matrix in vivo and lead to decreased compliance. Our results also support the concept that bladder outlet obstruction, with resultant pressures of 40 cmH(2)O or less, results in molecular changes consistent with decreased compliance."

The novelty of this research works in the one-step formation of WO3-loaded TiO2 nanotube arrays composite film by using tungsten as the cathode material instead of the conventionally used platinum electrode. As compared with platinum, tungsten metal has lower stability, forming dissolved ions (W6+) in the electrolyte. The W6+ ions then move towards the titanium foil and form a coherent deposit on titanium foil. By controlling the oxidation rate and chemical dissolution rate of TiO2 during the electrochemical anodization, the nanotubular structure of TiO2 film could be achieved. In the present study, nanotube arrays were characterized using FESEM, EDAX, XRD, as well as Raman spectroscopy. Based on the results obtained, nanotube arrays with average pore diameter of up to 74 nm and length of 1.6 µm were produced. EDAX confirmed the presence of tungsten element within the nanotube arrays which varied in content from 1.06 at% to 3.29 at%. The photocatalytic activity of the nanotube arrays was then investigated using methyl orange degradation under TUV 96W UV-B Germicidal light irradiation. The nanotube with the highest aspect ratio, geometric surface area factor and at% of tungsten exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity due to more photo-induced electron-hole pairs generated by the larger surface area and because WO3 improves charge separation, reduces charge carrier recombination and increases charge carrier lifetime via accumulation of electrons and holes in the two different metal oxide semiconductor components.

12	15783304	15783304	Plasmon exchange model for superconductivity in carbon nanotubes and metallic nanowires	Recent investigations of superconductivity in carbon nanotubes have shown that a single-wall zig-zag nanotube can become superconducting at around 15 K. Theoretical studies of superconductivity in nanotubes using the traditional phonon exchange model, however, give a superconducting transition temperature T c less than 1 K. To explain the observed higher critical temperature we explore the possibility of the plasmon exchange mechanism for superconductivity in nanotubes. We first calculate the effective interaction between electrons in a nanotube mediated by plasmon exchange and show that this interaction can become attractive. Using this attractive interaction in the modified Eliashberg theory for strong coupling superconductors, we then calculate the critical temperature T c in a single-wall nanotube. Our theoretical results can explain the observed T c in a single-wall nanotube. In particular, we find that T c is sensitively dependent on the dielectric constant of the medium, the effective mass of the electrons and the radius of the nanotube. We then consider superconductivity in a bundle of single-wall nanotubes and find that bundling of nanotubes does not change the critical temperature significantly. Going beyond carbon nanotubes we show that in a metallic hollow nanowire T c has some sort of oscillatory behaviour as a function of the surface number density of electrons.	[19]	['Physics']

The results showed that, 175 stable and clear bands were amplified by 13 primers, and 13.5 bands were obtained by each primer on the average. PCR products mainly presented between 200 bp and 2 000 bp, among which 158 bands were polymorphic, accounted for90.3%. Clustering analysis of genetic structure indicated that 100 wild banana samples including Yanqian, Xinkou and Chibi wild banana were divided into three groups strictly according to geographical distribution. The three groups could be further divided into 3, 3 and 4 subgroups respectively. The parameters of genetic diversity revealed that variation within group was greater than that between groups among the total variation of wild banana populations which existed abundant gene exchange. There was a high level of genetic diversity in wild banana,and Yanqian wild banana present the highest, followed by Xinkou wild banana, Chibi wild banana as the lowest.This study showed Fujian wild banana possessed independent genetic structure, and that water, human beings played key roles in population evolution of wild banana.

Changes in ultrastructure and induction of Heat Shock Proteins 70 have been studied in Conocephalum conicum (Marchantiales) collected in different urban and country sites in Italy. These results were compared to the effects in vitro of exposition to different heavy metals for several days. At urban sites, cellular ultrastructure was modified, and heavy metals could be observed accumulating in cell walls. Simultaneously, a strong increment in Hsp70 was detected, compared with results observed on control specimens. When C. conicum was exposed to heavy metals in vitro, comparable effects as in polluted sites were observed: Cd and Pb accumulated mostly within parenchyma and, within cells, were absorbed to cell walls or concentrated in vacuoles. Moreover, severe alterations were observed in organelles. Concomitantly, a progressive accumulation of Hsp70 was detected following heavy metals exposition. These effects are discussed in order to describe the dose and time-dependent response to heavy metal stress in C. conicum.	[9]	['Environmental science']

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of symptomatic vertebral body compression fractures (VCFs) requiring kyphoplasty or surgery in patients treated with 24-Gy single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS This retrospective analysis included all patients who had been treated with 24-Gy, single-fraction, image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy for histologically confirmed solid tumor metastases over an 8-year period (2005-2013) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Charts and imaging studies were reviewed for post-SRS kyphoplasty or surgery for mechanical instability. A Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) was calculated for each patient both at the time of SRS and at the time of intervention for VCF. RESULTS Three hundred twenty-three patients who had undergone single-fraction SRS between C-1 and L-5 were included in this analysis. The cumulative incidence of VCF 5 years after SRS was 7.2% (95% CI 4.1-10.2), whereas that of death following SRS at the same time point was 82.5% (95% CI 77.5-87.4). Twenty-six patients with 36 SRS-treated levels progressed to symptomatic VCF requiring treatment with kyphoplasty (6 patients), surgery (10 patients), or both (10 patients). The median time to symptomatic VCF was 13 months. Seven patients developed VCF at 11 levels adjacent to the SRS-treated level. Fractured levels had no evidence of tumor progression. The median SINS changed from 6.5 at SRS (interquartile range [IQR] 4.3-8.8) to 11.5 at stabilization (IQR 9-13). In patients without prior stabilization at the level of SRS, there was an association between the SINS and the time to fracture. CONCLUSIONS Five years after ablative single-fraction SRS to spinal lesions, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic VCF at the treated level without tumor recurrence was 7.2%. Higher SINSs at the time of SRS correlated with earlier fractures.	[17]	['Medicine']

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a genome-wide significant locus for KC in the region of PNPLA2 (rs61876744), as well as a suggestive signal in the MAML2 (rs10831500) locus. In order to validate their findings, here we performed a replication study of the Han Chinese population, with 120 sporadic KC cases and 206 gender and age matched control subjects, utilizing the TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. SNP rs10831500, as well as two proxy SNPs for rs61876744, named rs7942159 and rs28633403, were subjected to genotyping. However, we did not find a significant difference (P > 0.05) in all the three genotyped SNPs between KC cases and the controls. A further meta-analysis on four previous cohorts of white patients and this Han Chinese cohort showed a significant genetic heterogeneity within the replicated loci. Thus, the current study suggests that SNP rs61876744 (or its proxy SNPs) and rs10831500 might not be associated with KC susceptibility in this Han Chinese cohort, and a large-scale association analysis focusing on the loci is therefore warranted in further investigations.

Bar Formation and Recurrent Buckling	A fraction of early-type dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster have a disk component and even possess disk features such as bar, lens, and spiral arms. In this study, we construct 15 galaxy models that resemble VCC856, considered to be an infalling progenitor of disk dwarf galaxies, within observational error ranges, and use $N$-body simulations to study their long-term dynamical evolution in isolation as well as the formation of bar in them. We find that dwarf disk galaxies readily form bars unless they have an excessively concentrated halo or a hot disk. This suggests that infalling dwarf disk galaxies are intrinsically unstable to bar formation, even without any external perturbation, accounting for a population of barred dwarf galaxies in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster. The bars form earlier and stronger in galaxies with a lower fraction of counter-streaming motions, lower halo concentration, lower velocity anisotropy, and thinner disk. Similarly to normal disk galaxies, dwarf disk galaxies also undergo recurrent buckling instabilities. The first buckling instability tends to shorten the bar and to thicken the disk, and drives a dynamical transition in the bar pattern speed as well as mass inflow rate. In nine models, the bars regrow after the mild first buckling instability due to the efficient transfer of disk angular momentum to the halo, and are subject to recurrent buckling instabilities to turn into X-shaped bulges.

Conformal prediction methods provide an elegant framework for answering such question by building a $100 (1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence region without assumptions on the distribution of the data. It is based on a refitting procedure that parses all the possibilities for $y$ to select the most likely ones. Although providing strong coverage guarantees, conformal set is impractical to compute exactly for many regression problems. We propose efficient algorithms to compute conformal prediction set using approximated solution of (convex) regularized empirical risk minimization. Our approaches rely on a new homotopy continuation technique for tracking the solution path with respect to sequential changes of the observations. We also provide a detailed analysis quantifying its complexity.	[5]	['Computer science']

The tube uses hemispherically shaped 3/8"" diameter dynodes crimped into kovar cups. The dynode assemblies are alternately stacked between high-alumina ceramic rings and brazed into a rugged single piece construction envelope. The structure has an outside diameter of 0. 5 inches with an overall length of 2.75 inches and is capable of withstanding extreme environmental conditions. The tube withstands 100 g shocks for 11 msec duration, random vibration levels of 1.3 g2 /Hz, and can be operated over a temperature range from liquid N2 to 400°C. The electron optics of the discrete dynodes provide optimum interstage electron collection. The single electron pulse height distribution at gains higher than 108 is nearly Gaussian and has a FWHM of approximately 0.6. Complete data on pulse height distribution characteristics is reviewed over the dynamic range of the device. The photon sensitivity of the device will be discussed within the range of 58.3 to 150 nm as well as the adaptability for charged particle conversion below 3 keV. Fatigue characteristics are examined as a function of accumulated counts up to 1012, exposure to controlled atmospheres of dry air, noble gases, and maximum counting rates up to 10 MHz. Applications for these detectors are reviewed, including their projected use in mass spectroscopy experiments on the Apollo 17 mission."	[19]	['Physics']
26	27265860	27265860	Responsive design for household surveys: tools for actively controlling survey errors and costs	Summary. Over the past few years surveys have expanded to new populations, have incorporated measurement of new and more complex substantive issues and have adopted new data collection tools. At the same time there has been a growing reluctance among many household populations to participate in surveys. These factors have combined to present survey designers and survey researchers with increased uncertainty about the performance of any given survey design at any particular point in time. This uncertainty has, in turn, challenged the survey practitioner’s ability to control the cost of data collection and quality of resulting statistics. The development of computer-assisted methods for data collection has provided survey researchers with tools to capture a variety of process data (‘paradata’) that can be used to inform cost–quality trade-off decisions in realtime. The ability to monitor continually the streams of process data and survey data creates the opportunity to alter the design during the course of data collection to improve survey cost efficiency and to achieve more precise, less biased estimates. We label such surveys as ‘responsive designs’. The paper defines responsive design and uses examples to illustrate the responsive use of paradata to guide mid-survey decisions affecting the non-response, measurement and sampling variance properties of resulting statistics.

The transition occurs when the coupling strength exceeds a critical value which, in sharp contrast to the standard two-level emitters, can be tuned by an external magnetic field. In addition to emitted radiation, the molecules develop an in-plane electric dipole moment at the transition. We estimate that the transition can be detected in state of the art microwave strip-line cavities containing $10^{15}$ molecules.	[15]	['Materials science']

The causes of spinal cord dysfunction are cord compression, ischemic infarction of the cord, and acute myelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cord is the choice of investigation which not only helps to rule out any compressive lesion but will also confirm the diagnosis of myelitis. The usual findings of myelitis on MRI spine are the hyperintensities in T2-weighted images that predominantly involve the gray matter and usually extend from the cervical to the lumbar cord. Usually, patients are left with some residual deficits including spasticity, weakness, walking difficulties, and bowel–bladder dysfunction.

For example, it has been said that the last act of a dying organization is to issue a greatly enlarged policy manual. But policy itself is like any other management tool: it can be used or abused. Thus, the question for college administrators is not whether one should have formal policy, but rather what policies are needed and how they can be put to work for more effective organizational functioning. The purposes of this article are to review the role of institutional policy, to cite frequent abuses of policy, and finally to delineate the several principles of policy management. It is hoped that a review of the pitfalls and standards of policy application will provide a set of criteria against which a university administration may gauge the effectiveness of its existing policy management.

38	206900700	206900700	TRIM: An architecture for transparent IMS-based mobility	In recent years, the development and deployment of new wired and wireless access network technologies have made the ubiquitous Internet a reality. Users can access anywhere and anytime to the broad set of value-added Internet services, which are delivered by means of the IP protocol. In this context, 3GPP is currently developing the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), as a key element that allows to evolve from the ubiquitous access to the Internet services towards a next generation network model, by providing a set of essential facilities such as session control, QoS, charging and service integration. Nevertheless, several open issues still need consideration before the future Internet becomes real, such as supporting user mobility in IP networks. Although mobility support in the Internet is receiving much attention, IMS networks present inherent particularities that require further analysis. The solutions proposed so far for IMS do not support mobility transparently to the end-user applications, or address the problem by introducing complex changes to the IMS infrastructure. This paper presents TRIM, an architecture for transparent IMS-based mobility. TRIM supports mobility in IMS networks transparently to the end-user applications, which are unaware of the handover management procedures executed between the mobile node and the network. We have performed several experiments with a TRIM prototype, using a real IMS testbed with 3G and WLAN access networks, validating the proposal for UDP and TCP based applications.

To conduct a prospective evaluation for effectiveness of an error disclosure assessment tool and video recordings to enhance student learning and metacognitive skills while assessing the IPEC competencies. Design. The instruments for assessing performance (planning, communication, process, and team dynamics) in interprofessional error disclosure were developed. Student self-assessment of performance before and after viewing the recordings of their encounters were obtained. Faculty used a similar instrument to conduct real-time assessments. An instrument to assess achievement of the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) core competencies was developed. Qualitative data was reviewed to determine student and faculty perceptions of the simulation. Assessment. The interprofessional simulation training involved a total of 233 students (50 dental, 109 nursing and 74 pharmacy). Use of video recordings made a significant difference in student self-assessment for communication and process categories of error disclosure. No differences in student self-assessments were noted among the different professions. There were differences among the family member affects for planning and communication for both pre-video and post-video data. There were significant differences between student self-assessment and faculty assessment for all paired comparisons, except communication in student post-video self-assessment. Students’ perceptions of achievement of the IPEC core competencies were positive. Conclusion.

42	56244271	56244271	An Optimality Theoretic Approach to Accent Insertion	This paper explores the accentuation in the words consisting of inherently unaccented morphemes in the languages which distinguish between inherently accented and unaccented morphemes. In this paper, a variety of accent insertion in non-Indo-European languages (Turkish, Tokyo Japanese, Cupeno, and Thompson River Salish) is presented and compared with the word-initial accent insertion in Vedic Sanskrit, which is an Indo-European language. Then, from the viewpoint of Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince and Smolensky 1993 and McCarthy and Prince 1993a, b), it is argued that the parametric difference in the ranking relation of ALlGN-R(ACC, PrWd) and ALIGN-L(ACC, PrWd) between Vedic Sanskrit and Turkish causes the difference in accent insertion between these languages. Further, the examination of accentual systems of Cupeno and Thompson River Salish shows that Root Faith >> Affix Faith as a meta-constraint is too fixed to explain a cross-linguistic variety of places for an inserted accent. This examination also shows that the difference in accent insertion among languages should be explained by the different rankings among domain-specific DEP-IO-faithfulness constraints.

45	8767623	8767623	The plasma membrane transporter SLC5A8 suppresses tumour progression through depletion of survivin without involving its transport function.	SLC5A8 (solute carrier gene family 5A, member 8) is a sodium-coupled transporter for monocarboxylates. Among its substrates are the HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors butyrate, propionate and pyruvate. Expression of SLC5A8 is silenced in cancers via DNA methylation, and ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in cancer cells induces apoptosis in the presence of its substrates that are HDAC inhibitors. In the present study we show that ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in cancer cells translocates the anti-apoptotic protein survivin to the plasma membrane through protein-protein interaction resulting in depletion of nuclear survivin and also decreases cellular levels of survivin through inhibition of transcription. These SLC5A8-induced changes in the location and levels of survivin result in cell-cycle arrest, disruption of the chromosome passenger complex involved in mitosis, induction of apoptosis and enhancement in chemosensitivity. These effects are seen independently of the transport function of SLC5A8 and histone acetylation status of the cell; in the presence of pyruvate, a SLC5A8 substrate and also an HDAC inhibitor, these effects are amplified. Ectopic expression of SLC5A8 in the breast cancer cell line MB231 inhibits the ability of cells to form colonies in vitro and to form tumours in mouse xenografts in vivo. The suppression of survivin transcription occurs independently of HDAC inhibition, and the underlying mechanism is associated with decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). The observed effects are specific for survivin with no apparent changes in expression of other inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins. The present study unravels a novel, hitherto unrecognized, mechanism for the tumour-suppressive role of a plasma membrane transporter independent of its transport function.

This paper finds that waiting times for hip fracture surgery declined after the NHS reforms and patients were more likely to be discharged to another provider. However, hospitals have not simply shifted the burden of care to other providers, since lengths of stay ending in a discharge to home fell. The effect of wait time on surgical outcomes is small in magnitude and cannot explain the postreform improvements in outcomes.	[6]	['Economics']

It is assumed here that the x-ray imaging conditions that include the relative coordinates of the x-ray source and the image plane are predetermined and the object geometry is known. In this situation, an x-ray image of an object at a given pose can be estimated computationally by using a priori known x-ray projection image model. It is based on the assumption that a pose of an object can be determined uniquely to a given x-ray projection image. Thus, once we have the numerical model of x-ray imaging process, x-ray image of the known object at any pose could be estimated. Then, among these estimated images, the best matched image could be searched and found. When adequate features in the images are available instead of the image itself, the problem becomes easier and simpler. In this work, we propose an efficient pose estimation algorithm for polyhedral objects whose image features consist of corner points and edge lines in their projection images. Based on the corner points and lines found in the images, the best-matched pose of a polyhedral object can be determined. To achieve this, we proposed an adequate and efficient image processing algorithm to extract the features of objects in x-ray images. The performance of the algorithm is discussed in detail including the limitations of the method. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method a series of simulation studies is carried out for various imaging conditions.	[5]	['Computer science']
56	226394932	226394932	Evaluation of a field-deployable Nafion™-based air-drying system for collecting whole air samples and its application to stable isotope measurements of CO2	"Abstract. Atmospheric flask samples are either collected at atmospheric pressure by simply opening a valve of a pre-evacuated flask, or pressurized with the help of a pump to a few bar above ambient providing large air samples for analysis. Under humid conditions, there is a risk that water vapour in the sample leads to condensation on the walls of the flask, notably at higher than ambient sampling pressures. Liquid water in sample flasks is known to affect the CO2 mixing ratios and also alters the isotopic composition of oxygen (17O and 18O) in CO2 via isotopic equilibration. Hence, for accurate determination of CO2 mole fractions and its stable isotopic composition, it is vital to dry the air samples to a sufficiently low dew point before they are pressurized in flasks to avoid condensation. Moreover, the drying system itself should not influence the mixing ratio and the isotopic composition of CO2, nor of the other constituents under study. For the ""Airborne Stable Isotopes of Carbon from the Amazon"" (ASICA) project focusing on accurate measurements of CO2 and its singly-substituted stable isotopologues over the Amazon, an air drying system was needed capable of removing water vapour from air sampled at a dew point better than −2 °C, high flow rates up to 12 L/min, and without the need for electrical power. Since to date, no commercial air drying device is available that meets these requirements, we designed and built our own consumable-free, power-free, and portable drying system based on multi-tube Nafion™ gas sample driers (Perma Pure, Lakewood, USA). The required dry purge air is provided by feeding the exhaust flow of the flasks sampling system through a dry molecular sieve (type 3A) cartridge. In this study we describe the systematic evaluation of our Nafion-based air sample dryer with emphasis on its performance concerning the measurements of atmospheric CO2 mole fractions and the three singly-substituted isotopologues of CO2 (16O13C16O, 16O12C17O and 16O12C18O), as well as the trace gas species CH4, CO, N2O, and SF6. Experimental results simulating extreme tropical conditions (saturated air at 33 °C) indicated that the response of the air dryer is almost instantaneous and that approximately 85 L of air, containing up to 4 % water vapour, can be processed staying below a −2 °C dew point temperature (at 275 kPa). We estimated that least 8 flasks can be sampled (at an overpressure of 275 kPa) with a water vapour content below −2 °C dew point temperature during a typical flight sampling up to 5 km altitude over the Amazon, whereas the remaining samples would stay well below 5 °C dew point temperature (at 275 kPa). The performance of the air dryer on measurements of CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, and SF6, and the CO2 isotopologues 16O13C16O and 16O12C18O was tested in the laboratory simulating real sampling conditions by compressing humidified air from a calibrated cylinder, after being dried by the air dryer, into sample flasks. We found that the mole fraction and the isotopic composition difference between the different test conditions (including the dryer) and the base condition (dry air, without dryer) remained well within or very close to, in the case of N2O, the WMO recommended compatibility goals for independent measurement programs, proving that the test condition induced no significant bias on the sample measurements."

We performed facility shielding calculations that accounted for the produced neutron flux. Method and Materials: Workload assumptions (80Gy/day) yielded the number of protons produced per day. The vendor did not provide extraction efficiency, neutron yields from the treatment field shaping system, or neutron yield estimates from the synchrocyclotron. To provide a conservative neutron yield we assumed; the largest scatteredfield size and complete portal blocking, conservatively low cyclotron production efficiency (25%), and a high quality factor (20) for neutron dose equivalent calculations. Neutrons were assumed to be produced at the isocenter location, by stopping the SOBP protons in a Cu target. The room design includes a sub‐floor to allow rotation of the accelerator below the sub‐floor level. Classical analytical methods were used to calculate required barrier thicknesses based on neutron yields, accounting for angular dependences, and based on concrete (standard or high density (HD)), earth, and steel. Maze calculations used analytical approaches, heavily influenced by the number of bounce paths, and maze area. Conservative use and occupancy factors were used. Results: The shielding calculations resulted in barrier thicknesses similar to existing proton facilities; from 4ft to 6.25ft of HD concrete. Some design features included; reducing the maze ceiling height to reduce the source area of scatteredneutrons, adding an additional leg at the door entrance to allow for an unshielded door, and adding steel to surround unavoidable barrier voids. To reduce cost, the barriers that did not shield occupy‐able space, used standard concrete. Conclusion: The neutron yield from the Monarch 250 is unknown, so conservative values were used in the shielding calculations. Vault design strategies were developed to reduce overall construction cost. We allow for contingencies if we underestimated any barrier thickness.	[17, 19]	['Medicine', 'Physics']
62	52886092	52886092	Mean annual temperature estimation based on leaf morphology: a test from tropical South America	Abstract Are models that predict mean annual temperature (MAT) from leaf morphology applicable globally? Fifteen models that predict MAT from leaf morphology were tested on thirty floral samples from tropical South America to determine the degree to which models based on published data that are primarily from other regions are applicable to floras from tropical South America. The models included are based on regional data from North America, South America, and Asia. Of the fifteen models tested, five are simple linear regressions, six are multiple linear regressions, two are canonical correspondence analyses, and two are correspondence analyses followed by nearest neighbor analyses. For the seven modern floras with MAT ≤21°C, every model overestimates MAT. For the 23 modern floras with MAT >21°C, all models produce variable results without a systematic error. The range of average model errors is 2.7–7.3°C, while the absolute extremes of error are 0 and 15.1°C. Average 95% predictive confidence intervals range from 1.6 to 6.9°C. Predicted MAT falls within the published standard error of the model for 0–67% of the South American test floras. Evaluating the seven sites with MAT ≤21°C separately from the 23 sites with MAT >21°C shows that no equation accurately estimates MAT of the majority of low-temperature sites, but that four equations accurately estimate >50% of high-temperature sites. The results suggest that at least for sites of unknown or high elevation, mean annual temperature of fossil floras from tropical South America may be better predicted from models based on the leaf morphology of tropical South American floras.

Here, for the first time, we unravel the interplay between many-body interactions and correlations in highly excited anatase TiO2 nanoparticles using ultrafast two-dimensional deep-ultraviolet spectroscopy. With this approach, under nonresonant excitation, we disentangle the optical nonlinearities contributing to the bleach of the lowest direct exciton peak. This allows us to clock the ultrafast time scale of the hot electron thermalization in the conduction band with unprecedented temporal resolution, which we determine to be <50 fs, due to the strong electron–phonon coupling in the material. Our findings call for the design of alternative resonant excitation schemes in photonics and nanotechnology.	[19]	['Physics']

Recent advances in the area of computer and video processing have created new ways to monitor quality in the food industry. In this paper, we describe an image-processing technique to determine fat content in beef meat. To achieve this, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) images of beef meat have been used. The inherent advantages of NMR images are many. Chief among these are unprecedented contrasts between the various structures present in meat, such as muscle, fat, and connective tissue. Moreover, the three-dimensional nature of the NMR method allows the analysis of isolated cross-sectional slices of the meat and the measure of the volumetric content of fat, and it is not limited to measurements of the superficially visible fat. We propose a segmentation algorithm for the detection of fat and a filtering technique to remove intensity inhomogeneities in NMR images, caused by nonuniformities of magnetic field during acquisition. Measurements have been successfully correlated with chemical analysis and digital photography. We also propose a method to quantify the distribution of fat. Our results show that the NMR technique is a promising noninvasive method to determine fat content in meat.	[19]	['Physics']

Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion of the FMR1 gene. Individuals with fragile X display several behavioral abnormalities including hyperactivity, social anxiety, autistic-like features, impaired cognitive processing, and impaired sensorimotor gating. The Fmr1KO mouse model of fragile X exhibits several related behavioral phenotypes such as increased activity and altered social interactions. Individuals with fragile X also have impaired sensorimotor gating as measured using the prepulse inhibition of startle response. The authors have recently shown that Fmr1KO mice with a yeast artificial chromosome containing the human FMR1 gene have corrected or overcorrected abnormal behaviors including hyperactivity and altered social interactions. Here the authors present results from a study examining abnormal sensorimotor gating in Fmr1KO mice. Consistent with previous findings, Fmr1KO mice have increased prepulse inhibition. The KO mice with the yeast artificial chromosome containing the human FMR1 gene had levels of prepulse inhibition comparable to WT mice, indicating not only a correction of this phenotype, but also clearly demonstrating that in mice levels of the fragile X mental retardation protein regulate sensorimotor gating.

To help explain this variance, the present article moves beyond a rational self-interest account to examine the possibility that identity shapes individuals’ intentions to network. Study 1 established a positive association between viewing professional networking as identity-congruent and the tendency to prioritize strengthening and expanding one’s professional network. Study 2 revealed that manipulating the salience of the self affects networking intentions, but only among those high in networking identity-congruence. Study 3 further established causality by experimentally manipulating identity-congruence to increase networking intentions. Study 4 examined whether identity or self-interest is a better predictor of networking intentions, providing support for the former. These findings indicate that identity influences the networks people develop. Implications for research on the self, identity-based motivation, and professional networking are discussed.

By [3] it is always possible to define a topology on A which makes of A a locally convex algebra with separately continuous multiplication (i.e. xα, x, y ∈ A, xα → x implies xαy → xy, yxα → yx). On the other hand (cf. [3]) in general it is not possible to introduce a topology on A which makes of A a locally convex algebra with jointly continuous multiplication (i.e. xα → x, yβ → y ⇒ xαyβ → xy). The aim of this note is to exhibit two examples which continue these investigations. In the first example we construct a commutative algebra which admits no topology. This gives a negative answer to the question raised in [2]. In the second example we construct a topological algebra which admits no locally convex topology. All algebras in this paper will be complex (this condition, however, is not essential). We say that an algebra A is topologizable (topologizable as a locally convex algebra) if there exists a topology on A which makes of A a topological (locally convex) algebra with jointly continuous multiplication.

Most subjects pecked the key on more than 95% of trials. However, when pecking a differently colored key at an earlier time prevented this option from becoming available, three of 10 subjects consistently pecked it, thereby forcing themselves to wait for the larger reward. They did not peck the earlier key when it did not prevent this option. This is an experimental example of psychological impulse and a learnable device to control it. Although only a minority of the subjects learned it, the fact that such learning is possible at all argues for a theory of delayed reward that can predict change of preference as a function of elapsing time.

It caused a marked sedation in various animals at 20—40 mg/kg (ip) and a profound sedation with catalepsy in rats at 70—100 mg/kg ( ip) . In this paper the interaction between brain prostaglandins (PGs) and l-THP was studied. 
 After ip l-THP10 mg/kg, the spontaneous locomotor activities (walking, washing and rearing) of rats were decreased, but no catalepsy was found. Previous intraventricular injection (icv) of PGE or PGFpotentiated significantly the depression on the spontaneous locomotor activities of l-THP and induced catalepsy. However, when the brain PGs level had been lowered by ip indomethacin 20 mg/kg×2, the depression of the locomotor activities caused by l-THP 10 mg/kg was not diminished, and catalepsy was facilitated. 
 The radioimmunoassay (sensitivity 0.01 ng) was used for measuring PGE or PGF in brain tissues. In rats or mice given ip l-THP 100 mg/kg, a considerable increment of brain PGF accompanying a profound central effects was observed. The endogenous biosynthesis of PGs in cortex homogenate was not influenced by l–THP (mice, ip 100 mg/kg) and (rats, mM), but was inhibited by indomethacin. The PGs levels in rabbits' CSF were not affected by im l-THP 40 mg/kg.

This research utilizes meta-analysis to examine these relationships. The results indicate that control does enhance performance, although the strength of the relationship varies across types of control and different measures of performance. The results also show a significant relationship between formal and informal control modes, providing support for views of complementarities between modes within portfolios of control. It appears, however, that only clan control is positively associated with formal control. Building on these findings we suggest future directions for the study of control in ISD.

Randomly selected students required to take a remedial English course at a community college were placed in a regular English course on an experimental basis. The experimentally placed students were compared with those who enrolled in a regular course after passing a remedial course and with those who did not require remediation. Comparisons were made on ability, persistence, performance, and satisfaction. The remedial course had no effect on student satisfaction and persistence but a modest effect on subsequent course performance. The experimental methodology described can provide the college researcher with a basis for determining whether there is a need to revise or eliminate current remedial courses.	[7]	['Education']
84	129444934	129444934	Coastal hazards from slope mass movements: Analysis and management approach on the Barlavento Coast, Algarve, Portugal	Abstract The Barlavento Coast, Algarve, Portugal, is dominated by rocky sea-cliffs, cut on Miocene calcarenites which evolves through intermittent and discontinuous events of slope mass movements, along a 46 km cliff front. Here, the main coastal geologic hazards result from the conflict between human occupation and sea-cliff recession. Most of the research on the dynamics of the cliffs has been directed to the risk with the aim of defining long term set-back lines, for a preventive planning of the cliff top occupation. Little attention has been given to the hazard associated with mass movements on bathing beaches backed by sea-cliffs. This article presents the results of a field inventory of 244 slope mass movements single events, collected in a rocky shore with tens of touristic pocket beaches, covering an nineteen year time span (1995–2014). Results show that landslides have seasonal pattern with higher incidence in the period between winter and early spring. More than 15% of movements occur during the Easter holidays (April) and 4% of landslides occur during the official bathing season (June–September). The spatial distribution of landslides shows that only 22% of the mass movements occur in capes and headlands, while 78% occur on the beaches, which demonstrates that the beaches are real hot spots of risk. Based on the size distribution of slope mass movements runout ratio (the ratio between the radius of the base of the cone of and the height of the movement) a table of levels of security and hazard on beaches was built. Security levels enable the definition of cartographic hazard areas on beaches which can be provided to the beach users on information boards at the beach entrance.	[9]	['Environmental science']

The purpose of the study is to quantitatively analyze the role of health insurance in the determinants of catastrophic health payments in a low-income country setting.


METHODS
The study uses the most recent publicly available household level data from Zambia collected in 1998 containing detailed information on health care utilization and spending and on other key individual, household, and community factors. An econometric model is estimated by means of multivariate regression.


RESULTS
The main results are counterintuitive in that health insurance is not found to provide financial protection against the risk of catastrophic payments; indeed, insurance is found to increase this risk.


CONCLUSIONS
Reasons for the findings are discussed using additional available information focusing on the amount of care per illness episode and the type of care provided. The key conclusion is that the true impact of health insurance is an empirical issue depending on several key context factors, including quality assurance and service provision oversight."

Given its inherent complexity, coastal-fog literature has mainly focused on case studies, and there is a continuing need for research that integrates across processes (e.g., air–sea–land interactions, environmental flow, aerosol transport, and chemistry), dynamics (two-phase flow and turbulence), microphysics (nucleation, droplet characterization), and thermodynamics (heat transfer and phase changes) through field observations and modeling. Central to C-FOG was a field campaign in eastern Canada from 1 September to 8 October 2018, covering four land sites in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and an adjacent coastal strip transected by the Research Vessel Hugh R. Sharp. An array of in situ, path-integrating, and remote sensing instruments gathered data across a swath of space–time scales relevant to fog life cycle. Satellite and reanalysis products, routine meteorological observations, numerical weather prediction model (WRF and COAMPS) outputs, large-eddy simulations, and phenomenological modeling underpin the interpretation of field observations in a multiscale and multiplatform framework that helps identify and remedy numerical model deficiencies. An overview of the C-FOG field campaign and some preliminary analysis/findings are presented in this paper.	[9]	['Environmental science']
89	29035889	29035889	Increased expression of Toll‐like receptor 4 in peripheral blood leucocytes and serum levels of some cytokines in patients with ankylosing spondylitis	Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a member of the Toll‐like receptor family, which can bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. Activation of the TLR4 signalling pathway may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α and interleukin (IL)‐12, which was considered to play an important role in pathogenesis of immune‐mediated diseases. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an immune‐mediated disease whose aetiology remains unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of TLR4 and serum TNF‐α, IL‐12 and soluble tumour necrosis factor‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand (sTRAIL) level in AS patients. The results indicated that TLR4 protein and mRNA levels were significantly higher in AS patients than in healthy controls; however, there was no significant difference between human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‐B27‐positive and ‐negative AS patients, as well as serum levels of TNF‐α, IL‐12 and sTRAIL. In addition, in HLA‐B27‐positive AS patients, TLR4 level showed close associations with the cytokines and laboratory parameters of disease activity [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma C‐reactive protein (CRP)], respectively. Similarly, the strong associations between the cytokines or between IL‐12 and ESR or CRP were observed in HLA‐B27‐positive AS patients. Interestingly, in HLA‐B27‐positive AS patients, TNF‐α correlated significantly with ESR, but did not with CRP. In contrast, sTRAIL correlated with CRP, but did not with ESR. Among HLA‐B27‐negative patients, no close correlation was found. In our study, it was suggested that the abnormal activation of TLR4 signalling and serum TNF‐α, IL‐12 and sTRAIL may play a key role in the development and progression of AS, which may be dependent on the status of HLA‐B27 antigen.

90	17582929	17582929	Pulmonary vascular remodeling in congenital heart disease: enhanced expression of heat shock proteins.	In congenital heart disease (CHD), mechanical wall stress by increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary blood flow is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary plexogenic arteriopathy (PPA). The pathogenesis of this disease that involves significant pulmonary arterial remodelling, is, however, largely unknown. In the systemic circulation, upregulation of HSP-70 and HSP-27 in the arterial wall occurs in response to acute hypertension, whereas HSP-60 and increased titres of anti-HSP-60 antibodies are associated with atherosclerotic vessel disease. We looked for the involvement of HSPs in the stress response of pulmonary endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in different abnormal hemodynamic conditions in patients with CHDs. We analyzed the expression pattern of HSP-27, HSP-70 and HSP-60 in lung biopsies of 38 patients with CHD, using immunohistochemistry. These included 4 individuals with an essentially normal pulmonary circulation, who served as controls. Immunoreactivity against HSP-27 and also against HSP-70 was present in the pulmonary endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells of patients and controls in a similar pattern. In contrast, expression of HSP-60 was absent in pulmonary arteries of both patients and controls. In patients with advanced PPA, cells within plexiform lesions showed strong staining for HSP-27 and HSP-70, but were again negative for HSP-60. The intensity of immunoreactivity against HSP-70 correlated inversely with medial thickness of pre-acinar arteries (r = -0.32; p = 0.04). Expression of HSP-27 and HSP-70 did not correlate with hemodynamic parameters, although immunoreactivity against HSP27 tended to be increased in cases with high pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.37; p = 0.16) and was highest in patients with flow-associated pulmonary hypertension (p<0.01). HSP-27 and HSP-70, but not HSP-60 are engaged in the stress response of cells of small pulmonary arteries in pulmonary plexogenic arteriopathy. HSP-27 and HSP-70 are increasingly expressed in the advanced proliferative lesions of this disease.	[2, 4, 19]	['Biology', 'Chemistry', 'Physics']

There have been some researches on the indexing mechanisms for wireless data broadcasting in the past. We first describe the problematic issue in the conventional index replication scheme, and then propose various index replication methods based on three criteria: accessibility , energy efficiency and adjacency . We evaluate the proposed scheme in analytic and experimental ways. We show that the proposed index replication scheme reduces the data access cost of mobile clients in an energy efficient manner. We also discuss the relaxation of the given criteria.	[5, 8]	['Computer science', 'Engineering']

99	1005287	1005287	Enzymatic synthesis of butyl hydroxycinnamates and their inhibitory effects on LDL-oxidation.	The potential of the Aspergillus niger type A feruloyl esterase (AnFaeA) for the synthesis of various phenolic acid esters was examined using a ternary-organic reaction system consisting of a mixture of n-hexane, 1- or 2-butanol and water. Reaction parameters including the type of methyl hydroxycinnamate, the composition of the reaction media, the temperature, and the substrate concentration were investigated to evaluate their effect on initial rate and conversion to butyl esters of sinapic acids. Optimisation of the reaction parameters lead to 78% and 9% yield for the synthesis of 1-butyl and 2-butyl sinapate, respectively. For the first time, a feruloyl esterase was introduced in the reaction system as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), after optimisation of the immobilisation procedure, allowing the recycling and reuse of the biocatalyst. The inhibition of copper-induced LDL oxidation by hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding butyl esters was investigated in vitro. Kinetic analysis of the antioxidation process demonstrates that sinapate derivatives are effective antioxidants indicating that esterification increases the free acid's antioxidant activity especially on dimethoxylated compounds such as sinapic acid compared to methoxy-hydroxy-compounds such as ferulic acid.

100	56142264	56142264	Charter School Statutes and Special Education	Charter schools are a growing and evolving component of the public education sector. These schools may be exempt from state or local regulations, but they are part of the public system and subject to federal laws and many regulations. Research has documented policy tensions and basic challenges associated with developing special education programs in charter schools. A key source of these issues is ambiguity in individual state charter laws regarding roles and responsibilities related to special education. This article presents findings from a review of 41 charter statutes. The review reveals variability and lack of specificity among states in the legislative structures they maintain for charter schools and how responsibility for special education is assigned. These findings highlight the importance of federal, state, and district policy leaders developing a nuanced understanding of statutes shaping the parameters of responsibility for special education in the charter sector.

101	34545989	34545989	Influence of ultraviolet C bystander effect on inflammatory response in A375 cell on subsequent exposure to ultraviolet C or hydrogen peroxide.	Ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation (λ: 200-280 nm) causes release of several secretory cytokines responsible for inflammation. Our objective was to investigate whether inflammatory response was also induced in bystander cells. For this purpose, the conditioned medium containing the released factors from UVC irradiated A375 cells was used in this study to evaluate the expression of inflammatory markers, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in its bystander cells. Inflammatory responses in bystander cells subjected to further irradiation by UVC or other damaging agent like H2O2 were also examined. It was observed that TNFα, NFκB and p38 MAPK were not induced in UVC-bystander cells, but their expression was suppressed in the UVC-bystander cells treated with UVC or H2O2. This lowering in inflammatory response might be due to smaller depletion in the reduced glutathione (GSH) content present in these treated bystander cells. The study indicated that UVC-induced bystander effect was an intrinsic protective response in cells, capable of suppressing inflammation induced in cells on exposure to damaging agents.

The morphogenetic pathway leading to plant differentiation in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts could be regulated. The course of development via organogenesis or embryogenesis was controlled by manipulating nutrient media, culture conditions and hormone requirements. A lowering of molarity of medium after 5 weeks of protoplast culture, inclusion of GA3 (0.5 mg/l) in the medium for first 8 weeks of culture and exclusion of reduced nitrogen in the medium resulted in shoot organogenesis, while maintenance of higher molarity of the medium till 8 weeks, reduced nitrogen in the medium and removal of 2, 4-D after 5 weeks of culture induced embryogenesis. Regenerability of viable plants was obtained by both developmental pathways. The implications of tobacco embryogenesis system in plant molecular genetics were highlighted.

103	131191336	131191336	Magnetostratigraphy and paleomagnetic poles from Late Triassic-earliest Jurassic strata of the Newark basin	The Newark basin contains a 7-km-thick sedimentary section, which spans approximately 25 m.y. of the Late Triassic and earliest Jurassic (middle Carnian to Hettangian). Previously paleomagnetic study of the Newark red beds has demonstrated that complete progressive thermal demagnetization can effectively isolate a high-temperature characteristic magnetization. In the lower Newark strata (middle Carnian to early Norian in age), this magnetization yielded a pole position at 54°N, 102°E, and in the upper Newark strata (Hettangian in age) a pole position at 55°N, 95°E. Results from 23 new sites in the middle and upper Norian red beds of the Passaic Formation, including 15 sites from the Jacksonwald region that yield a positive fold test, fill the temporal gap between our two prior studies and yield a pole position at 56°N, 95°E (A 95 = 4.4°). These results from the middle Newark confirm that North American apparent polar wander was very slow (∼0.2°/m.y.) during the Late Triassic through earliest Jurassic. These new sites define reversed and normal polarity magnetozones that are stratigraphically consistent with and extend our previous results. The Newark reversed and normal polarity characteristic magnetizations form a correlatable pattern of 12 magnetozones that are stratigraphically coherent throughout the basin with respect to independent lithostratigraphic marker units that reflect synchronous, basinwide variations in water depth. Temporal calibration of the Newark magnetostratigraphy on the basis of biostratigraphy, radiometric age determinations, and Milankovich-driven cyclostratigraphy indicates that geomagnetic polarity was reversed 70% of the time and that the mean polarity duration was 2 m.y. or less during the Late Triassic and earliest Jurassic.

107	53367297	53367297	Large Josephson current in Weyl nodal loop semimetals due to odd-frequency superconductivity	Weyl nodal loop semimetals (WNLs) host a closed nodal line loop Fermi surface in the bulk, protected zero-energy flat band, or drumhead, surface states, and strong spin-polarization. The large density of states of the drumhead states makes WNL semimetals exceedingly prone to electronic ordering. At the same time, the spin-polarization naively prevents conventional superconductivity due to its spin-singlet nature. Here we show the complete opposite: WNLs are extremely promising materials for superconducting Josephson junctions, entirely due to odd-frequency superconductivity. By sandwiching a WNL between two conventional superconductors we theoretically demonstrate the presence of very large Josephson currents, even up to orders of magnitude larger than for normal metals. The large currents are generated both by an efficient transformation of spin-singlet pairs into odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing by the Weyl dispersion and the drumhead states ensuring exceptionally proximity effect. As a result, WNL Josephson junctions offer unique possibilities for detecting and exploring odd-frequency superconductivity.	[19]	['Physics']

[14C]-nanoparticles were prepared using the nanoprecipitation/solvent diffusion method, while fluorescent nanoparticles were prepared by incorporating rhodamine B. In situ phagocytic uptake was evaluated by flow cytometry. Body distribution in mice was evaluated by determining radioactivity in tissues using a scintillation method.Results:Phagocytic uptake by macrophages can be efficiently evaded by fluorescent PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles. After 48 h, 31% of the radioactivity of the stealth [14C]-PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles after iv injection was still found in blood, whereas non-stealth PHDCA nanoparticles were cleaned up from the bloodstream in a short time. The distribution of stealth PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles and non-stealth PHDCA nanoparticals in mice was poor in lung, kidney, and brain, and a little higher in hearts. Lymphatic accumulation was unusually high for both stealth and non-stealth nanoparticles, typical of lymphatic capture. The accumulation of stealth PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles in the spleen was 1.7 times as much as that of non-stealth PHDCA (P<0.01). But the accumulation of stealth PEG-PHDCA nanoparticles in the liver was 0.8 times as much as that of non-stealth PHDCA (P<0.05).Conclusion:PEGylation leads to long-circulation of nanoparticles in the bloodstream, and splenotropic accumulation opens up the potential for further development of spleen-targeted drug delivery.

Militão Plácido de França Antunes and his faction declared war on the family of Captain Bernardo José Guerreiro. Both families were based in the river town of Pilão Arcado, but the fighting spread to the nearby town of Sento-Sé, and by 1848 violence had engulfed the entire region from Barra to Juazeiro (see Figures 1 and 2). Bands of armed men loyal to Militão roamed the streets and attacked the households of people they considered to be on the side of the Guerreiros. Many people were killed, and others fled the region altogether. The violence ended only after Militão's faction killed Guerreiro's last adult son on August 1, 1848. Although a family feud in the backlands was not unusual, this fight resonated with coastal lawmakers who, in Brazil's Second Empire, had been looking toward conquering the west and consolidating their own vast territory. The reports of wrenching violence in the backlands, unchecked by the rule of law, represented the deepest fears of the coastal elite and made the need to conquer the Brazilian interior even more urgent.

These two objectives are antagonistic and leaking data might be more rewarding than concealing them. Unlike classical concepts of privacy that focus on the first point, we consider instead agents that optimize a natural trade-off between both objectives. We formalize this as an optimization problem where the objective mapping is regularized by the amount of information leaked by the agent into the system (measured as a divergence between the prior and posterior on the private data). Quite surprisingly, when combined with the entropic regularization, the Sinkhorn divergence naturally emerges in the optimization objective, making it efficiently solvable. We apply these techniques to preserve some privacy in online repeated auctions.	[5]	['Computer science']

However, some methods used to measured cytokines hinder their use as a diagnostic tool in renal rejection. In this report, cytokine levels were determined in the plasma and urine of kidney transplant patients, with renal rejection and without it, using a cytometric bead array (CBA) technique. Concentrations of six human cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-alpha and INF-gamma) were established. Results show that patients who develop renal rejection presented high levels of IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokines in plasma and urine compared to patients without renal rejection. The CBA technique displayed greater sensitivity in the determination of cytokines in urine than the conventional ELISA technique. Finally, when standard cytokines in plasma and in urine were compared, it was observed that, in plasma, levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were detected, whereas in urine the levels detected were of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-gamma. These results indicate that the CBA assay is a sensitive method to measure cytokines in urine. In kidney transplant patients undergoing acute renal rejection, the presence of cytokines in urine reflects renal damage and could be a useful method in the diagnosis of renal rejection.

Here, we obtained a total of 252.90 Gb of short Illumina reads and 31.60 Gb of long PacBio Sequel reads, representing approximate genome coverage of 256× and 50×, respectively. The final assembled genome is about 583.47 Mb with contig N50 sizes of 2.87 Mb, which accounts for 91.44% of the estimated genome size of 638.07 Mb. Using Hi-C–based chromatin contact maps, 99.31% of the genome assembly was placed into 25 chromosomes, and the N50 is 22.3 Mb. The gene annotation completeness was evaluated by BUSCO, and 2,470 of the 2,586 conserved genes (95.5%) could be found in our assembly. Repetitive elements were calculated to reach 33.08% of the whole genome. Moreover, we identified 25,406 protein-coding genes, of which 92.59% have been functionally annotated. This genome assembly will be a valuable genomic resource to understand the biology of the Tibetan loaches and will also set a stage for comparative analysis of the classification, diversification, and adaptation of fishes in Cobitoidea.

Pullulan-hydrolysing enzymes, more commonly known as debranching enzymes for starch and other polysaccharides, are of great interest and have been widely used in the starch-saccharification industry. Type III pullulan hydrolase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (TK-PUL) possesses both pullulanase and α-amylase activities. Until now, only two enzymes in this class, which are capable of hydrolysing both α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds in pullulan to produce a mixture of maltose, panose and maltotriose, have been described. TK-PUL shows highest activity in the temperature range 95-100°C and has a pH optimum in the range 3.5-4.2. Its unique ability to hydrolyse maltotriose into maltose and glucose has not been reported for other homologous enzymes. The crystal structure of TK-PUL has been determined at a resolution of 2.8 Å and represents the first analysis of a type III pullulan hydrolyse. The structure reveals that the last part of the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain are significantly different from homologous structures. In addition, the loop regions at the active-site end of the central catalytic domain are quite different. The enzyme has a well defined calcium-binding site and possesses a rare vicinal disulfide bridge. The thermostability of TK-PUL and its homologues may be attributable to several factors, including the increased content of salt bridges, helical segments, Pro, Arg and Tyr residues and the decreased content of serine.

Phishing is a difficult problem to address because there are many permutations, messages, and value propositions that can be sent to targets. Spear phishing is also associated with social engineering, which can be difficult for even trained or savvy employees to detect. This makes the user the critical point of entry for miscreants seeking to perpetrate cyber crimes such as identity theft and ransomware propagation, which cause billions of dollars in losses each year. Researchers are exploring many avenues to address this problem, including educating users and making them aware of the repercussions of becoming victims of phishing. The purpose of this study was to interview security professionals to gain better insight on preventing users and employees from succumbing to phishing attack. Seven subject-matter experts were interviewed, revealing nine themes describing traits that identify users as vulnerable to attack or strongly resistive to attack, as well as training suggestions to empower users to resist spear phishing attacks. Suggestions are made for practitioners in the field and future research.	[3]	['Business']

125	140559313	140559313	Anatomy of a mining-induced fault zone	A mining-induced fault zone that formed in the East Rand Proprietary Mine, Boksburg, South Africa, during the sloping of a large, highly stressed pillar is associated with two large seismic events that occurred within 17 days of each other; each event caused appreciable rock-burst damage in the neighboring stopes. The zone consists essentially of two high-angle normal faults intersecting at about 30°, across which shear displacements of as much as 10 cm were measured. In detail, the fault zone comprises two approximately planar shear zones, each of which strikes subparallel to the stope working faces at the time of the seismic events, and which encompass areas of at least 500 and 600 m 2 , respectively. The shear zones are themselves made up of smaller, en echelon shear planes, which are connected by subsidiary conjugate shears and extension fractures. These shear planes become diffuse and are replaced by extension and bedding-plane fractures at the boundaries of the fault zone. Microscopically, the shear planes are seen to contain a layer of finely comminuted gouge material within which fluxion structure may be developed. The wall rock adjacent to the gouge is a microbreccia formed by shattered quartz grains and larger areas of rock, cut by conjugate shear and extension fractures across which some comminution has also occurred. The microscopic observations suggest the following sequence of events resulting in the formation of the fault zone: (1) development of extension cracks in the region of planes of maximum shearing stress, (2) coalescence of extension cracks to form conjugate shear planes, and (3) rapid movement along the more favorably oriented of these shear planes to form the major gouge zone and feather fractures. Dynamic analyses of the attitudes of the microfractures and macrofractures define the stress field operating at the time of the seismic event. There is a striking similarity between the fault zones and natural faults, both in macroscopic and microscopic form and in the development of cataclastic rock types.	[11]	['Geology']

130	140535940	140535940	The sedimentology and context of Late Ordovician glacial marine sediments from Sierra Leone, West Africa	Abstract Glacial marine deposits (the Waterfall Formation of the Saionia Scarp Group) from northern Sierra Leone, West Africa, correlate with sequences in Guinea and Senegal and indicate a Late Ordovician age. The sediments (150 m in thickness) are laminated mudstones (rhythmites) of alternating fine laminae and lenticular, graded, coarse laminae a few millimetres thick. Dispersed clasts of various rock types occur within the rhythmites, which also locally contain slump structures. Interbedded with the rhythmites and dropstones are turbidites, with sole structures, amalgamated and graded beds. Transport directions are from the north. Deposition from low-density melt-water suspension currents derived from a shelf glacier is suggested for the rhythmites, with the clasts emplaced by iceberg rafting. Underlying the glacial sediments are subarkoses with heavy-mineral laminae and cross-bedded, super-mature quartz arenites attributed to a shallow-water tidal origin. The occurrence of glacial marine sediments in Sierra Leone provides a southwestern boundary to the ice-sheet which is well-documented as covering much of the Sahara and Northwest Africa during Late Ordovician time, and further emphasizes the great area affected by this glaciation.

Drawing from relevant literature, a predictive model was developed to test the influence of demography, religiosity and porting behaviour on CSB. Empirical data were collected through a cross-sectional survey design involving 736 mobile subscribers from six telecoms in Ghana. Data were analysed using binary logistics regression to test the proposed model. The results indicate that the effect of some demographics (age, income and length of relationship) and porting behaviour were statistically significant in predicting mobile subscribers’ switching behaviour, while other demographics (gender, education, marital status and phone use experience) and religiosity did not contribute to predicting switching behaviour of mobile subscribers in Ghana. The theoretical and managerial implications of this study are discussed. The limitations of this study offer avenues for future research.	[3]	['Business']

135	24880084	24880084	Transverse bacterial migration induced by chemotaxis in a packed column with structured physical heterogeneity.	The significance of chemotaxis in directing bacterial migration toward contaminants in natural porous media was investigated under groundwater flow conditions. A laboratory-scale column, with a coarse-grained sand core surrounded by a fine-grained annulus, was used to simulate natural aquifers with strata of different hydraulic conductivities. A chemoattractant source was placed along the central axis of the column to model contaminants trapped in the heterogeneous subsurface. Chemotactic bacterial strains, Escherichia coli HCB1 and Pseudomonas putida F1, introduced into the column by a pulse injection, were found to alter their transport behaviors under the influence of the attractant chemical emanating from the central source. For E. coil HCB1, approximately 18% more of the total population relative to the control without attractant exited the column from the coarse sand layer due to the chemotactic effects of alpha-methylaspartate under an average fluid velocity of 5.1 m/d. Although P. putida F1 demonstrated no observable changes in migration pathways with the model contaminant acetate under the same flow rate, when the flow rate was reduced to 1.9 m/d, approximately 6-10% of the population relative to the control migrated from the fine sand layer toward attractant into the coarse sand layer. Microbial transport properties were further quantified by a mathematical model to examine the significance of bacterial motility and chemotaxis under different hydrodynamic conditions, which suggested important considerations for strain selection and practical operation of bioremediation schemes.

140	142585522	142585522	Engineering Philadelphia: The Sellers Family and the Industrial Metropolis	in the nation’s capital, in the museum world, and in cultural diplomacy circles. Neil Harris’s new book Capital Culture: J. Carter Brown, the National Gallery of Art, and the Reinvention of the Museum Experience charts the career of this administrator, a power broker who negotiated the international worlds of arts, politics, and commerce and placed the National Gallery at the forefront of innovation in exhibition, sponsorship, and visitor services. In the eyes of the press and the public, Brown, one of the superstar museum directors of the 1970s and 80s, came to embody the National Gallery. The relationship between the individual and the institution and how both developed in the context of postwar shifts in funding, international relations, and cultural heritage are at the heart of Harris’s book. The National Gallery is an apt case study for the drastic changes in American art museums in the postwar period: it embodied the move from specialization and connoisseurship to public appeal, as well as the democratization of the arts in a cultural context of heightened public interest and increased funding, first, from the government and, later, from corporations. Harris, the Preston and Sterling Morton Professor of History and Art History Emeritus at the University of Chicago and an accomplished historian who has written about the complex relationship between individuals, institutions, and the larger culture, is well suited to this ambitious project. Like P. T. Barnum, who is perhaps Harris’s most notable subject, J. Carter Brown was a larger-than-life personality who was both a product of his particular cultural context and someone who changed it significantly. Although the trajectory of the National Gallery is emblematic of many of the larger changes to the postwar institutional landscape, it was and remains somewhat idiosyncratic: a museum with sometimes complicated ties to the federal government, as well as to the neighboring Smithsonian Institution. Although Harris’s focus is on Brown and the National Gallery, he includes two chapters on Brown’s counterpart S. Dillon Ripley, the longtime secretary of the Smithsonian, who shared with Brown a patrician background and a commitment to opening up museums to scholars and to the public. Likewise, New York’s Metropolitan Museum and its director Thomas Hoving—both a competitor and a collaborator throughout Brown’s tenure in Washington—often appear in Harris’s narrative. Chapters are loosely chronological and are, for the most part, organized around the signature projects undertaken by Brown: the acquisition of new pieces, such as Da Vinci’s Ginerva de’ Benci; the planning and construction of the National Gallery’s modernistic East Building; the cultivation of new sponsors and partners; and, above all, the blockbuster exhibitions that defined the National Gallery for much of the postwar period. Each chapter highlights a different part of the exhibit process, laying bare the intricate machinations necessary to mount shows such as The Treasure Houses of Britain and Circa 1492, which required international negotiations, fundraising, and complex installation by Brown and his colleagues. Brown’s skills at networking and diplomacy and his position at the center of cultural affairs are highlighted in a chapter on his longtime work with Washington, DC’s Commission of Fine Arts, presiding over difficult debates regarding the Vietnam War Memorial and other issues. Harris has used a rich archive to build his history, from the personal and professional papers of Brown, Ripley, and others at the National Gallery, the Smithsonian, and other institutions, to extensive interviews with Brown’s family, friends, colleagues, and contemporaries. He also makes use of journalistic sources. A subtheme of many chapters is the tension between Brown’s Washington, DC, and the New York of the Metropolitan Museum, and Harris’s perceptive analyses of reviews and reporting in the New York Times and Washington Post give us a sense of how critics and observers were thinking about the developments at both institutions. Harris’s lively and engaging book is an important addition to the growing field of museum studies and reflects more recent critical interest in the histories of cultural institutions. Capital Culture joins Edward Linenthal’s Preserving Memory (Columbia University Press, 2001), William Walker’s A Living Exhibition (University of Massachusetts Press, 2013), and others in presenting a valuable account of the interplay between politics and culture. The book contains important lessons for both students and practitioners, but it is also an interesting and appealing reading for any museumgoer—particularly one who, like myself, has visited the National Gallery of Art and remembers vividly some of the spectacular exhibitions that J. Carter Brown helped to create.	[12]	['History']

In the first phase, effects of lithium triflate content on ionic conductivity and structural properties of the SPEs are analysed and optimized. The ionic conductivity studies show that the AC and DC conductivities of SPEs increase with increasing the lithium triflate content and reach to orders of 10− 2 and 10− 3 S/cm, respectively. In the second phase, composite polymer electrolytes are fabricated by incorporating a ceramic filler, barium titanate (0–12 wt.%), to the optimized lithium triflate composition (15 wt.%) in PVdF-HFP matrix. The ionic conductivity of composite polymer electrolytes increases up to an order of one with the addition of filler up to 6 wt.% and decreases with further increase in the filler wt.%. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that the thermal stability of the electrolytes enhances by the addition of ceramic filler. The structural studies of the electrolytes show that the crystallinity decreases on addition of lithium triflate and barium titanate.	[15]	['Materials science']

As expected, positive affect increased the extent to which subjects formed inclusive group representations, anticipating that the members of two groups would feel like one, superordinate group. Also as predicted, subjects in dissimilarly dressed groups expected the memberships to feel less like one group. Consistent with the common in-group identity model, stronger superordinate group representations, in turn, predicted more positive out-group evaluations and lower levels of intergroup bias. The conceptual and applied implications of affect and social representations for improving intergroup relations are considered.	[21]	['Psychology']
143	147760077	147760077	Postmodernism and Institutionalism: Toward a Resolution of the Debate on Relativism	Probably the major event in the philosophy of science over the last several decades has been the death of foundationalism. It was Kuhn's revolutionary 1962 book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, that first announced this death to the world. But Kuhn was not alone; other philosophers too-Michael Polanyi, H. G. Gadamer, Richard Rorty, Paul Feyerabend, Charles Taylor, and Jurgen Habermas-have all pronounced foundationalism dead and have sought to move beyond it. Briefly stated, foundationalism is the notion that we can come to a true understanding of the world if our theories are logically based on some indubitable foundation, the fabled Archimedean fixed point from which we can leverage the rest of the world. But no such foundation apparently exists. Philosopher Richard Bernstein points out that since Descartes, there have been numerous attempts to establish such a foundation, but no sooner is a foundation posited than the process of critical undercutting begins, and after a while we come to see that the foundation is not so sound as originally thought. It is now widely accepted that there exists no grand or meta-narrative that explains the world from some objective, disinterested standpoint. There are only narratives based on particular perspectives and viewpoints. But though philosophers have generally agreed to jettison foundationalism, many of the sciences have not been so quick to throw it overboard, for they have long histories of allegiance to	[6]	['Economics']

Specifically, I posit that within an organization's IT department, OSS opinion leaders should have different social network profiles in terms of degree of centrality, betweenness, closeness and in-degree centrality from their peers who are not OSS opinion leaders. I also postulate that differences exist in the two groups' demographic characteristics such as age, educational level, tenure in organization, position in organization, and personality profiles such as openness and extraversion. A field survey using Social Network Analysis technique was carried out to test the hypotheses. Based on the findings, important theoretical and practical implications are identified.

146	123168469	123168469	The theory of the absorption of flame radiation by molecular bands.	The absorption of radiation by molecular bands is calculated when the source emits its energy in discrete spectral lines. The results are compared with those for a blackbody source. The absorption of flame radiation by the molecular bands of an absorbing medium is derived for a number of different conditions when the spectral lines do not overlap. These results are then extended to the case when the overlapping of the spectral lines in either the source or absorber can be described either by the Elsasser model or by the statistical model. When the same spectral lines are involved in the emission and absorption processes, the absorptance of flame radiation is always greater than the absorptance of blackbody radiation by the same medium. All of the above results are derived both for the case when the absorbing medium is homogeneous and when the pressure, temperature, and amount of absorbing gas vary along the path.	[19]	['Physics']

One hundred and thirteen admissions to alcohol and drug treatment facilities participated in the study. Twenty-six met the criteria for alcoholism (group I), seventy-eight subjects were alcohol-/cocaine- and cannabis-dependent (group II), and the remaining nine were patients with DSM-III-R diagnosis of cocaine addiction (group III). MAO activity was assayed radiochemically with [14C]tyramine as a substrate (221 microM).

The DNA from the rhizosphere soil was extracted and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced, whereas the abundances of the genes encoding for the PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (RHD) of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were quantified by real-time PCR. Both the contamination and the plant genotype significantly affected the bacterial communities. In particular, the allopolyploid S. anglica, harbored a more diverse bacterial community in its rhizosphere. The interspecific hybrid and the allopolyploid also harbored significantly more copies of the PAH-RHD gene of gram-negative bacteria in their rhizosphere than the parental species, irrespective of the contamination treatments. Overall, our results are showing that the recent polyploidization events in the Spartina affected its rhizosphere bacterial communities, both under normal and contaminated conditions, possibly increasing its phytoremediation potential.

Our starting point is a quark-diquark model for the baryons (obeying approximate covariance; the mesons are kept as elementary objects), together with the relative phases for the NN vertices, as determined from low energy NN scattering. From the explicit representation of the N and N* baryons, we exemplify the derivation of the coupling constants and form factors of the NN*(1535,1/2-)transition vertices for pseudo-scalar, scalar and vector mesons.

"The far-lateral approach (FLA) has become a mainstay for skull base surgeries involving the anterior foramen magnum and lower clivus. The authors present a surgical technique using the FLA for the management of lesions of the anterior/ anterolateral foramen magnum and lower clivus. The authors consider this modification a ""lazy"" FLA. The vertebral artery (VA) is both a critical anatomical structure and a barrier that limits access to this region. The most important nuance of this FLA technique is the management of this critical vessel. When the lazy FLA is used, the VA is reflected laterally, encased in its periosteal sheath and wrapped in the dura, greatly minimizing the risk for vertebral injury while preserving a wide working space. To accomplish this step, drilling is performed lateral to the point where the VA pierces the dura. The dura is incised medial to the VA entry point by using a slightly curved longitudinal cut. Drilling of the condyle and the C-1 lateral mass is performed in a manner that preserves craniocervical stability. The lazy FLA is a true FLA that is based on manipulation of the VA and lateral bone removal to obtain excellent exposure ventral to the spinal cord and medulla, yet it is among the most conservative FLA techniques for management of the VA and provides a safer window for bone work and lesion management. Among 44 patients for whom this technique was used to resect 42 neoplasms and clip 2 posterior inferior cerebral artery aneurysms, there was no surgical mortality and no injury to the VA."

This article follows the approach of Mallows (1973, 1975) and modifies these estimators so that the resulting estimators have bounded-influence functions. The large-sample behavior of these estimators is studied, and it is shown that they have the same asymptotic distribution. The small-sample behaviors of the ordinary-regression and bounded-influence-regression trimmed means are then investigated by means of a Monte Carlo study and by applying the estimators to water-salinity data (see Ruppert and Carroll 1980). Based on these results we conclude that one can potentially gain much by using bounded-influence-regression trimmed means over ordinary-regression trimmed means; however, there does not seem to be a clear choice between the Koenker-Bassett and Welsh versions.

A common and challenging situation occurs when the objective function (in Bayesian applications, the expected utility) is very expensive to evaluate, perhaps because it requires integration over a space of very large dimensionality. Our goal is to explore a class of optimization algorithms designed to gain efficiency in such situations, by exploiting smoothness of the expected utility surface and borrowing information from neighboring design points. The central idea is that of implementing stochastic optimization by curve fitting of Monte Carlo samples. This is done by simulating draws from the joint parameter/sample space and evaluating the observed utilities. Fitting a smooth surface through these simulated points serves as estimate for the expected utility surface. The optimal design can then be found deterministically.

166	219706591	219706591	PIF4 and PIF5 regulate axillary branching via bud abscisic acid and stem auxin signaling.	The ratio of red light to far-red light (R:FR) is perceived by phytochrome B (phyB) and informs plants of nearby competition. A low R:FR indicative of competition induces the shade avoidance syndrome and suppresses branching by incompletely understood mechanisms. PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) are transcription factors targeted by phytochromes to evoke photomorphogenic responses. PIF4 and PIF5 promote shade avoidance responses and become inactivated by direct interaction with active phyB in the nucleus. Here, genetic and physiological assays show that PIF4 and PIF5 contribute to the suppression of branching resulting from phyB loss of function and a low R:FR, though roles for other PIFs or pathways may exist. The suppression of branching is associated with PIF4/PIF5 promotion of the expression of the branching inhibitor BRANCHED 1 and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in axillary buds, and is dependent on the function of the key ABA biosynthetic enzyme NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 3. However, PIF4/PIF5 function is not confined to a single hormonal pathway, as they also promote stem indole-3-acetic acid accumulation and stimulate systemic auxin signaling, which contribute to the suppression of bud growth when phyB is inactive.

Rat epididymal fat-pads were incubated for 30min with glucose (2mg/ml) in the presence or absence of insulin. A twofold or greater increase in acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was observed in extracts from insulin-treated tissue provided that assays were performed rapidly after extraction. This effect of insulin was evident whether or not extracts were prepared with albumin, and was not noticeably diminished by the presence of citrate or albumin or both in the assay. Incubation of extracts before assay led to activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and a marked diminution in the insulin effect. The enzyme in extracts was very sensitive to reversible inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA even in the presence of albumin (10mg/ml); inhibition persisted on dilution of enzyme and inhibitor. It is suggested that the observed activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by insulin may reflect changes in enzyme activity in the fat-cell resulting from the reduction of long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA that occurs in the presence of insulin. Activation of the enzyme with loss of the insulin effect on incubation of the extracts may be due to the slow dissociation of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA from the enzyme.

After the acoustic exposure, the level of Hb-NO-complexes have increased by more than 6 times. The intensity of the EPR signal of the plasma peptide transferrin increased by 1,5 times. The level of blood methemoglobin was also elevated, though not significantly, after the acoustic stress.

An evaluation of feedstock and conversion alternatives	The feasibility of meeting California’s low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) using ethanol from various feedstocks is assessed. Lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, direct agricultural land use, petroleum displacement directly due to ethanol blending, and production costs for a number of conventional and lignocellulosic ethanol pathways are estimated under various supply scenarios. The results indicate that after considering indirect land use effects, all sources of ethanol examined, except Midwest corn ethanol, are viable options to meet the LCFS. However, the required ethanol quantity depends on the GHG emissions performance and ethanol availability. The quantity of ethanol that can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass resources within California is insufficient to meet the year 2020 LCFS target. Utilizing lignocellulosic ethanol to meet the LCFS is more attractive than utilizing Brazilian sugarcane ethanol due to projected lower direct agricultural land use, dependence on imported energy, ethanol cost, required refueling infrastructure modifications and penetration of flexible fuel E85 vehicles. However, advances in cellulosic ethanol technology and commercial production capacity are required to support moderate- to large-scale introduction of low carbon intensity cellulosic ethanol. Current cellulosic ethanol production cost estimates suffer from relatively high uncertainty and need to be refined based on commercial scale production data when available.

During the earliest Holocene (10,930−9000 cal yr BP), the climate was warm and wet, allowing thermophilous hardwoods to occupy mid- and low-elevations surrounding a palaeo-Changjiang estuary. The climate became gradually cooler, and cool-tolerant conifers, grasses and ferns became dominant until 7600 cal yr BP, when the estuary became a delta. A mid-Holocene climatic optimum occurred between 7600 and 4800 cal yr BP, when evergreen and broadleaved deciduous trees flourished at mid- and low-elevations surrounding the delta front-prodelta. After this time, climate became cooler again until 1340 cal yr BP. During this period, evergreen and broadleaved deciduous trees were replaced by conifers and grasses inhabiting the inter/subtidal flat-delta front. This development of conifer–grassland vegetation was shortly interrupted between 3860 and 3200 cal yr BP when thermophilous tree cover increased and open vegetation with scattered conifers was reduced. Since 1340 cal yr BP, the vegetation has been similar to that at present under warm, wet conditions. Human impacts are recognized by the first appearance of Fagopyrum and a sudden increase in herb pollen at 4500 and 1340 cal yr BP, respectively.	[9, 10]	['Environmental science', 'Geography']
179	16103238	16103238	European starlings are capable of discriminating subtle size asymmetries in paired stimuli.	Small deviations from bilateral symmetry (fluctuating asymmetries) are cues to fitness differences in some animals. Therefore, researchers have considered whether animals use these small asymmetries as visual cues to determine appropriate behavioral responses (e.g., mate preferences). However, there have been few systematic studies of animals' abilities to visually discriminate such minor asymmetries. If the asymmetries cannot be discriminated, fluctuating asymmetry can not be a visual cue. Here, we report an investigation of European starlings' (Sturnus vulgaris) abilities to discriminate small size asymmetries. We trained starlings, through operant conditioning in a free-flight aviary, to discriminate achromatic, symmetric paired stimuli from size-matched asymmetric stimuli. By starting the learning process with a large asymmetry and progressing through sequential trials of decreasing asymmetry, we elucidated a behavioral limit to asymmetry discrimination. We found that starlings are capable of discriminating a 10% size asymmetry. There was weaker evidence for discrimination of 5% asymmetry but no evidence for signal discrimination at 2.5% size asymmetry. This level of asymmetry discrimination suggests that many size asymmetry cues in nature can be discriminated by birds. At each level of asymmetry discrimination, we also tested whether starlings could generalize their learned symmetry preference to unreinforced novel images. Consistent with previous findings, we found that starlings could generalize their symmetry preferences.	[2, 21]	['Biology', 'Psychology']

The increased number of wavelength-tuneable synchrotron beamlines capable of performing challenging MAD experiments, coupled with the widespread availability of charge-coupled device (CCD) based X-ray detectors with fast read-out times have brought MAD structure determination to a new exciting level. Ultrafast MAD data collection is now possible and, with the widespread use of selenium in the form of selenomethionine for phase determination, the method is growing in popularity. Recent developments in crystallographic software are complementing the above advances, paving the way for rapid protein structure determination. An overview of a typical MAD experiment is described, with emphasis on the rates and quality of data acquisition now achievable at third-generation synchrotron sources.	[4]	['Chemistry']

187	152900675	152900675	Location Tax Incentive Not Federal Taxable Income	The IRS said in a coordinated issue paper that a location tax incentive paid or credited to a business by a unit of state or local government is not included in the business's gross income but rather reduces its tax expense. A location tax incentive is a tax reduction by abatement, credit, deduction, rate reduction or exemption given to a taxpayer as an incentive to locate in, remain in or expand its operations in a particular area. These incentives are not considered purchases from the taxpayer because they do not require the taxpayer to provide any services or property to the taxing jurisdiction. They benefit the taxpayer but are provided primarily for the economic benefit of the community at large. The taxpayer also does not realize an accession to wealth resulting in gross income. Some corporate taxpayers have argued that such rebates should be treated as an exclusion from taxable income as a nonshareholder contribution to capital under IRC [section] 118, while they also include them in the full amount of tax expense deductible under section 164, the IRS said. These taxpayers would then reduce their basis of property under section 362(c) by the amount of the purported nonshareholder capital contribution. IRC [section] 118(a) does allow the money or value of property given to the corporation by the government or a civic group to be excluded from gross income (IRC [section] 61) as a nonshareholder contribution to capital. However, since a tax rebate is more like a discount on a liability than new incoming money or property, it is not a nonshareholder contribution to capital, the IRS said. Even if such incentives were otherwise deemed to be gross income, they still generally would not be eligible for IRC [section] 118 treatment, which requires taxpayers to meet five factors, the IRS said, citing U.S. v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. (412 U.S. 401, 413 (1973)): (1) The contribution must become a permanent part of the transferee's working capital structure; (2) the contribution must not be compensation for specific, quantifiable services provided by the transferee to the transferor; (3) the contribution must be bargained for; (4) the asset transferred must result in a benefit to the transferee commensurate with its value; and (5) the asset transferred ordinarily, if not always, will be used to produce additional income.

Subjects and Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey in which we interviewed 500 community-dwelling Kuwaiti adults over 65 years of age. The data collection occurred during a 4-month period from March to July 2017. Results: Fifty-two percent (n = 260) of the patients were males, with a mean age of 71.73 ± 5.32 years. The prevalence of polypharmacy (5–8 drugs) and excessive polypharmacy (>8 drugs) was 58.4% (n = 292) and 10.2% (n = 51), respectively. The risk factors associated with an increased number of medicines used were: female gender (p = 0.019), a lower level of education (p = 0.003), a high number of hospital admissions (p = 0.000), clinics visited by the patient (p =0.000), and number of comorbidities (p = 0.000). The most commonly used medications (82.6% of the study population) were blood glucose-lowering agents, excluding insulin. Other commonly used medications were antihypertensive drugs and lipid-modifying agents. Conclusion: A significant sector of the older Kuwaiti patient population has a high prevalence of polypharmacy and is thus exposed to its potential hazards. The current study highlights the need to revise the drug-dispensing policy among community-dwelling, older Kuwaiti people, as well as to initiate educational programs among healthcare practitioners concerning prescribing issues in older individuals.

195	123043072	123043072	Three-dimensional holographic display	A system of superimposed volume holographic gratings was used to construct a three-dimensional display operating in real time. The number of such gratings was equal to the number of cross sections of the imaged information. The principle of operation of the display was analyzed. The main characteristics of the image and their dependences on the parameters of the display components were determined. The results of an experimental study of the holographic components of the display confirmed its principle of operation.	[8, 19]	['Engineering', 'Physics']

198	14216257	14216257	A pivotal role for reductive methylation in the de novo crystallization of a ternary complex composed of Yersinia pestis virulence factors YopN, SycN and YscB.	Structural studies of a ternary complex composed of the Yersina pestis virulence factors YopN, SycN and YscB were initially hampered by poor solubility of the individual proteins. Co-expression of all three proteins in Escherichia coli yielded a well behaved complex, but this sample proved to be recalcitrant to crystallization. As crystallization efforts remained fruitless, even after the proteolysis-guided engineering of a truncated YopN polypeptide, reductive methylation of lysine residues was employed to alter the surface properties of the complex. The methylated complex yielded crystals that diffracted X-rays to a maximal resolution of 1.8 A. The potential utility of reductive methylation as a remedial strategy for high-throughput structural biology was further underscored by the successful modification of a selenomethionine-substituted sample.

199	63058945	63058945	AN ADAPTIVE IMPORTANCE SAMPLING METHOD FOR ESTIMATION OF RELIABILITY SENSITIVITY	On the basis of the simulated annealing algorithm for global optimization, an adaptive importance sampling method is presented for evaluation of reliability sensitivity. In the presented method, the simulated annealing optimization is employed to seek, in the failure region gradually, the most probable failure point used as the sampling center of the adaptive importance sampling function. The samples generated by the adaptive importance sampling functions are utilized to estimate the reliability sensitivity. The reliability sensitivity evaluation, the variance and the variation coefficient of the evaluation are derived for the adaptive importance sampling based on the reliability sensitivity method. Compared to the Monte-Carlo method through the demonstration of examples, it can be observed that the presented method is more efficient.	[8]	['Engineering']
