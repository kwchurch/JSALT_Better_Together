This method can transform standard multi material topology optimization formulations into a series of equivalent single material topology optimization ones to overcome the various limitations inherent to conventional techniques. First, typical multi material topology optimization methods utilize material interpolation schemes that restrict the study to the isotropic domain with a constant Poisson's ratio, limiting practical applications and solution accuracy. Additionally, in attempts to further extend these classical multi material topology optimization methods to anisotropic materials, preparing the necessary element information matrices becomes increasingly laborious or even impossible for complex models, preventing the application of sensitivity analysis for robust gradient based optimization methods. To directly address these limitations, the element interpolation method replaces material interpolation schemes with an element interpolation framework, where each design cell property is determined using a weighted sum of various coincident single material elements. This paper provides a thorough description of element interpolation and presents several numerical examples demonstrating successful implementation.	2019	Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	2	-0.44999998807907104

Previous approaches use a combination of different sensors, or work well, only in scenarios with noticeable road marking or borders. Our robot is used for chemical, nuclear and biological contamination measurement. Thus, to avoid complications with decontamination, only a monocular camera serves as a sensor since it is already equipped. In this paper, we propose a novel approach a fusion of frequency based vanishing point estimation and probabilistically based color segmentation. Detection of a vanishing point, is based on the estimation of a texture flow, produced by a bank of Gabor wavelets and a voting function. Next, the vanishing point defines the training area, which is used for self supervised learning of color models. Finally, road patches are selected by measuring of the roadness score. A few rules deal with dark cast shadows, overexposed highlights and adaptivity speed. In addition to the robustness of our system, it is easy to use since no calibration is needed.	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	0.31200000643730164	1.160640001296997	4	0.03700000047683716

Their relevance for current medical practice is investigated. The status which is ascribed to these documents will be shown and the status which they can reasonably claim to have will be explored. Arguments in favor of the Hippocratic Oath that rely on historical stability or historical origin are being examined. It is demonstrated that they get caught up in paradoxes. Should doctors swear the Hippocratic Oath or the Declaration of Geneva? The Hippocratic Oath is a remarkable historic document, which contains important elements still relevant for medical ethics today. Its interpretation as a timeless, still valid medical code is unfounded. The historical arguments, that should justify its validity, are untenable. The Declaration of Geneva, and not the Hippocratic Oath, can legitimately claim to come close to representing the most important principles of professional medical conduct in today's globalised world.	2019	Medicine, health care, and philosophy	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	1	-0.6940000057220459

Analysis shows that widespread of rumors typically results from deliberately promoted information campaigns which aim to shape collective opinions on the concerned news events. In this paper, we attempt to fight such chaos with itself to make automatic rumor detection more robust and effective. Our idea is inspired by adversarial learning method originated from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) We propose a GAN style approach, where a generator is designed to produce uncertain or conflicting voices, complicating the original conversational threads in order to pressurize the discriminator to learn stronger rumor indicative representations from the augmented, more challenging examples. Different from traditional data driven approach to rumor detection, our method can capture low frequency but stronger non trivial patterns via such adversarial training. Extensive experiments on two Twitter benchmark datasets demonstrate that our rumor detection method achieves much better results than state of the art methods.	2019	WWW	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

Specifically, combination of the planar/homogenic and homeotropic alignment, forming thus spatially limited regions characterized by a different LC molecular orientation, has been tested, as achieved by means of the photo orientation and photo polymerization processes, independently. An influence of molecular orientation on the light beam propagation has been checked for different directions of the linear polarization. Thanks to the molecular reorientation induced by the low frequency external electric field and also to the reorientational nonlinearity taking place in NLCs, propagation direction of the light beam can be additionally controlled by the electric bias and/or optical power, respectively. Proposed structural solutions and techniques, related to the photo orientation and photo polymerization processes described in this communication, give rise to the novel LC geometries and structures. The latter act as promising candidates for new practical photonic applications as they are expected to be of a particular importance for integrated optic elements and devices.	2017		0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	6	0.5249999761581421

However, most of deep learning based bearing fault diagnosis methods are based on the assumption that the recorded samples are labeled data, though most of field data are recorded without label information. To address this issue, an effective semi supervised learning method based on the principle of consistency regularization is proposed in this study. The principle of consistency regularization underlines that the model predictions should be less sensitive to the extra perturbation imposed on the input samples. In the proposed method, a data augmentation method is proposed to serve as the extra perturbation, which is imposed on both the labeled and unlabeled samples to enrich the data library. Meanwhile, a label predicting process is formulated to estimate the appreciable label distribution for the unlabeled sample. Correspondingly, two consistency loss terms are introduced to regularize the model predictions for both the labeled and unlabeled samples to be invariant to the extra perturbation, among which a supervised loss term is adopted to enforce the model predictions for augmented labeled samples to be consistent with its true label information and an unsupervised loss is proposed to minimize the discrepancy between label distributions for the original unlabeled samples and its appreciable label distributions. The analysis result on an experimental bearing fault dataset demonstrates that the proposed method can provide an excellent identification performance under limited labeled samples situation.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716

Highlights are usually manually specified by the authors. This paper presents a supervised approach, based on regression techniques, with the twofold aim at automatically extracting highlights of past articles with missing annotations and simplifying the process of manually annotating new articles. To this end, regression models are trained on a variety of features extracted from previously annotated articles. The proposed approach extends existing extractive approaches by predicting a similarity score, based on n gram co occurrences, between article sentences and highlights. The experimental results, achieved on a benchmark collection of articles ranging over heterogeneous topics, show that the proposed regression models perform better than existing methods, both supervised and not.	2020	Expert Syst.

Molecular characterization of the disease has led to the rapid development of personalized medicine and swift delivery of targeted therapies to patients. The discovery of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in patients with NSCLC has resulted in rapid bench bedside transition of several active drugs, with several others currently in clinical trials. After the first generation ALK inhibitor crizotinib, next generation ALK inhibitors have entered clinical applications for ALK rearranged NSCLC. Ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib have all received approval for ALK positive patients who have failed prior crizotinib, as well as first line therapy in treatment naive patients based on favorable efficacy. Most recently, lorlatinib, a potent, newer generation ALK inhibitor, has been approved as second or third line treatment. These advances have led to better patient outcomes, but concurrently have led to several crucial unanswered questions about optimal care for ALK positive NSCLC patients. The ultimate acquisition of resistance to ALK inhibitor therapy poses a challenge to ongoing research efforts, in addition to the routine management of these patients in the clinic. This review provides a summary of the clinical development of crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib and highlights current management paradigms, current and evolving clinical information, emerging clinical decision making and sequencing of therapy in advanced, metastatic, or recurrent ALK positive NSCLC.	2020	Cancer management and research	0.875	3.255000114440918	2	-0.44999998807907104

The progress performed in that field is continuously growing, also thanks to a huge amount of investments done by all the main car manufacturers. Vision systems play a key role into this process of driving automation, that's why during this work two of them will be accurately analyzed through a validation procedure that allows to evaluate their limits and the main critical issues depending on the environmental conditions. The two systems that will be analyzed are: a lane detection system (fundamental to perform autonomous lane keeping) and an object detection system (needed for a lot of functions like the automatic braking or the recognition of road signs) The choice of these two systems is mainly due to the fact that they perform some of the most important tasks needed for autonomous driving. The lane detection system has been implemented in Matlab(r) using the same working principle of the GOLD system developed by Massimo Bertozzi and Alberto Broggi. The object detection system, instead, is YOLOv3, which is the most powerful algorithm for object detection in real time currently available. It is based on neural networks and has been developed by Joseph Redmond et al. The validation procedure has been done through a series of tests performed using a specific dataset for each system. Each dataset has been developed taking into account the following parameters: lighting condition, presence of defects and weather conditions. The main aim of this work is to evaluate how and if these parameters influence the level of performance, in order to understand what must be improved and what, instead, has reached a sufficient level of maturity. The results of this analysis shown a certain level of robustness for both the systems, especially for YOLOv3, however also some weaknesses have been discovered. The lane detection system gave bad results in roads with unclear or colored road markings, moreover, bad weather conditions and macro defects leaded to a significant performance degradation. For what concerns YOLOv3, it shown to have a higher level of robustness in every condition, detecting most of the objects even with low resolution input images. The parameter that influenced most significantly the performances are the lighting conditions, which leaded every time to a worsening of the results.	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	1	-0.6940000057220459

Although almost every popular Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is designed with an architecture to provide higher efficiency, ultimately a single database management service will read the database and serve the results through http in the common scenario. So, a drastic performance reduction is visible while serving the http requests with the fetched data from the databases.This research examines the efficiency difference between micro service architecture and mono service architecture for web based database management systems by analyzing the time taken to get the response with data for READ operations with different record sizes. This research proposes a simple and generic web service architecture in managing HTTP requests which require fetching data from the underlying SQL adhering the micro service concepts.	2020	2020 20th International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)	0.875	3.255000114440918	1	-0.6940000057220459

Machine Learning Applied to Initial Romantic Attraction	Matchmaking companies and theoretical perspectives on close relationships suggest that initial attraction is, to some extent, a product of two people's self reported traits and preferences. We used machine learning to test how well such measures predict people's overall tendencies to romantically desire other people (actor variance) and to be desired by other people (partner variance) as well as people's desire for specific partners above and beyond actor and partner variance (relationship variance) In two speed dating studies, romantically unattached individuals completed more than 100 self report measures about traits and preferences that past researchers have identified as being relevant to mate selection. Each participant met each opposite sex participant attending a speed dating event for a 4 min speed date. Random forests models predicted 4% to 18% of actor variance and 7% to 27% of partner variance; crucially, however, they were unable to predict relationship variance using any combination of traits and preferences reported before the dates. These results suggest that compatibility elements of human mating are challenging to predict before two people meet.	2017	Psychological science	0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	3	-0.2070000022649765

Jan became an accomplished scholar of the New Testament, and I would like to honour him for his friendship, collegiality and scholarship with this article. Drawing on information from my field of specialisation, I might shed more light on the world in which the New Testament was embedded. It is commonly accepted that the world of the New Testament was characterised by relative peace and prosperity (Furnish 1984:365) and yet the New Testament contains several references to violence. Jesus told his disciples that should anyone slap them on the right cheek, they should let the person slap their left cheek too (Mt 5:39) Selvidge (1984:214) points out that 'there are many statements in Matthew that contain violent implications, both physical and verbal' adding that 'readers of the gospel are not normally aware of (much less outraged by) the violent traditions preserved in Matthew' In a parable Jesus refers to disobedient servants being beaten with many blows (see Lk 12:35 48) Paul describes how false teachers slap the Corinthians in the face (2 Cor 11:20) We also read in Acts 23:1 that the High Priest (of all people) ordered those who were standing close to Paul to strike him on the mouth. We can interpret some of these instances metaphorically, but the reality is that violence was quite common in the ancient world. Peter Brown (1992:50) describes late antiquity as 'a world characterized by a chilling absence of legal restraints on violence in the exercise of power' Pinker (2011:xxi) even argues that 'today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence'	2017		0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	1	-0.6940000057220459

Yet, current models still fail to capture the full range and scales of variations of atmospheric perturbations. This work explores the use of an image to image translation method, CycleGAN, to learn a function that wraps and improves an imperfect model for atmospheric correction. CycleGAN is a generative adversarial network, in which discriminators determine which images are real, and generators produce images to fool the discriminators. Training the discriminators and generators against each other improves the resulting translation function. We have tested this approach using Sentinel 1A data gathered around Puebla, Mexico, which was the starting point of the 2017 earthquake that devastated Mexico City. CycleGAN can generate visually compelling fringes, including small scale perturbations that are absent from the atmospheric models, while limiting noisy areas. However, it fails to capture the variations of amplitude behind the fringes, especially at large scale, and the generated interferograms remain too different from the real interferograms. Solving that amplitude issue could create practical applications for a CycleGAN type method in atmospheric correction or phase unwrapping. The large amount of InSAR data and the continuous progress of deep learning methods provide ample opportunity for improvement.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716

This study investigates the contribution of EI and AM on the two major leadership categories: the task oriented and relationship oriented leadership. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a quantitative study with the implementation of correlation and hierarchical regression analysis. The surveys (i.e. EI scale, AM scale, leadership style questionnaire) were sent randomly to 280 elementary school principals in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and 90 of them completed the survey (mostly male=77.78 percent) Findings Principals' EI significantly predicted both task oriented and relationship oriented leadership. In contrast, the principals' AM yielded non significant results in predicting both task oriented and relationship oriented leadership style. The results also suggested that the effect of EI on two major leadership styles (i.e. task and relationship orientation) outperformed the leader's AM. Research limitations/implications This study did not consider the principals' performance in the analysis. Future studies should also address this issue by considering leadership performance as well as different culture and context. On the other hand, the authors developed new measures rather than using preexisting measures. Although the measures have been constructed according to the scale construction principles and reached an acceptable standard, future research should advance the psychometric property of the scales. Originality/value This study discusses the effect of EI and AM on task and relationship orientation leadership. In addition, this study has also brought a new insight into understanding leadership styles in collective culture such as Indonesia.	2019	International Journal of Educational Management	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

The rapidly changing landscape of oncology has brought new light, and with it, new challenges to optimizing therapeutic strategies for patients. Although the concept of patient heterogeneity is well known to any practicing clinician, a more detailed understanding of the biologic changes that underscore the clinical picture is beginning to emerge. Thus, tumor heterogeneity has come to encompass more than just the clinical picture and can represent both intratumor and intertumor differences. Within the fields of thoracic oncology and melanoma, the discovery of key molecular drivers has resulted in landmark breakthroughs in therapy. However, the complexities of tumor genetics and the interaction within the environment continue to drive the search for better therapies. Ongoing challenges include the accurate and timely assessment of genetic changes as well as the development of resistance and the resultant compensatory mechanisms. Novel technologies, including commercially available next generation sequencing, have allowed for a greater breadth and depth of information to be gained from a single pathologic specimen, and it is now being incorporated into routine clinical practice. Translational advances have subsequently provided valuable insight into mechanisms of resistance, with the development of novel treatment strategies. Future work will focus on novel diagnostic techniques and adaptive mechanisms that can ultimately drive the development of the next generation of cancer therapy.	2016	American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Modern public cloud platforms heavily rely on virtualization for efficient resource sharing, the potentials of which have yet to be explored. Migrating gaming to a public cloud is nontrivial, however, particularly considering the overhead for virtualization and that the graphics processing units (GPUs) for game rendering has long been an obstacle in virtualization. This paper takes a first step toward bridging the online gaming system and the public cloud platforms. We present the design and implementation of a fully virtualized cloud gaming platform with the latest hardware support for both remote servers and local clients. We explore many critical design issues inherent in cloud gaming, including the choice of hardware or software video encoding, and the configuration and the detailed power consumption of thin client. We demonstrate that with the latest hardware and virtualization support, gaming over virtualized cloud can be made possible with careful optimization and integration of the different modules. We also highlight critical challenges toward full fledged deployment of gaming services over the public virtualized cloud.	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	0.5619999766349792	2.090640068054199	3	-0.2070000022649765

However, because the culture of Chinese is much different from that of American, so do their attitude towards their family, friends, colleague and boss, and their principles and ways to deal with their interpersonal relationships. In order to make this kind of cross culture communication go on much more smoothly, it is necessary to explore and learn their differences of interpersonal relationships.

The severity, repetition frequency and the fault excited resonance zone by these impulses are the key indicators for diagnosing bearing faults. In this paper, a methodology based on over complete rational dilation wavelet transform (ORDWT) is proposed, as it enjoys a good shift invariance. ORDWT offers flexibility in partitioning the frequency spectrum to generate a number of subbands (filters) with diverse bandwidths. The selection of the optimal filter that perfectly overlaps with the bearing fault excited resonance zone is based on the maximization of a proposed impulse detection measure ""Temporal energy operated auto correlated kurtosis"" The proposed indicator is robust and consistent in evaluating the impulsiveness of fault signals in presence of interfering vibration such as heavy background noise or sporadic shocks unrelated to the fault or normal operation. The structure of the proposed indicator enables it to be sensitive to fault severity. For enhanced fault classification, an autocorrelation of the energy time series of the signal filtered through the optimal subband is proposed. The application of the proposed methodology is validated on simulated and experimental data. The study shows that the performance of the proposed technique is more robust and consistent in comparison to the original fast kurtogram and wavelet kurtogram."	2018		0.75	2.7899999618530273	3	-0.2070000022649765

The nonlinearity f is assumed to be either superlinear or resonant. In the latter case, least energy sign changing solutions are second eigenfunctions of the zero Dirichlet p Laplacian in O. We show that the nodal set of any least energy sign changing solution intersects the boundary of O. The proof is based on a moving polarization argument.	2019	Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Section A Mathematics	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	2	-0.44999998807907104

Intrathecal fentanyl, a m opioid receptor agonist, was employed to attenuate afferent feedback from the leg muscles during intense cycling exercise characterized by either no or severe peripheral locomotor muscle fatigue. In the absence of locomotor muscle fatigue, group III/IV mediated leg afferent feedback facilitates the responsiveness of the motor pathway to upper limb flexor muscles. By contrast, in the presence of leg fatigue, group III/IV locomotor muscle afferents facilitate supraspinal fatigue in a remote muscle not involved in the exercise and disfacilitate the responsiveness of associated corticospinal projections.	2014	The Journal of physiology	0.5	1.8600000143051147	9	1.2569999694824219

A meta analysis of 85 independent effect sizes extracted from 46 primary studies involving a total of 36,793 learners indicated statistically significant positive effects of CT on mathematics achievement. In addition, several characteristics of primary studies were identified as having effects. For example, CT showed advantage in promoting mathematics achievement of elementary over secondary school students. As well, CT showed larger effects on the mathematics achievement of special need students than that of general education students, the positive effect of CT was greater when combined with a constructivist approach to teaching than with a traditional approach to teaching, and studies that used non standardized tests as measures of mathematics achievement reported larger effects of CT than studies that used standardized tests. The weighted least squares univariate and multiple regression analyses indicated that mathematics achievement could be accounted for by a few technology, implementation and learner characteristics in the studies.	2010		0.25	0.9300000071525574	2	-0.44999998807907104

Accordingly, ISOs should solve an optimal power flow to minimize the operating cost of a system while meeting the system's security constraints. However, transmission congestion could drastically limit more economical generating units from being dispatched in the power system operation. In this paper, a decentralized transmission switching is introduced in the operation of multi area power systems to manage the congestion both on regional transmission lines and tie lines while considering credible contingencies. Our proposed methodology relies on a decentralized optimization methodology. Thus, regional control centers in areas would be able to locally manage the congestion within their regional networks as well as tie lines connecting them to their neighboring areas. Several testing systems are studied in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed method.	2018	IEEE Transactions on Power Systems	0.75	2.7899999618530273	3	-0.2070000022649765

Dengue virus (DV) exists in four different serotypes and infection caused by one serotype predisposes its host to another DV serotype heterotypic re infection. We undertook virtual ligand screening (VLS) to filter compounds against DV that may inhibit inclusively all of its serotypes. Conserved non structural DV protein targets such as NS1, NS3/NS2B and NS5, which play crucial role in viral replication, infection cycle and host interaction, were selected for screening of vital antiviral drug leads. A dataset of plant based natural antiviral derivatives was developed. Molecular docking was performed to estimate the spatial affinity of target compounds for the active sites of DV's NS1, NS3/NS2B and NS5 proteins. The drug likeliness of the screened compounds was followed by ADMET analysis whereas the binding behaviors were further elucidated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments. VLS screened three potential compounds including Canthin 6 one 9 O beta glucopyranoside, Kushenol W and Kushenol K which exhibited optimal binding with all the three conserved DV proteins. This study brings forth novel scaffolds against DV serotypes to serve as lead molecules for further optimization and drug development against all DV serotypes with equal effect against multiple disease causing DV proteins. We therefore anticipate that the insights given in the current study could be regarded valuable towards exploration and development of a broad spectrum natural anti dengue therapy.	2019	Scientific Reports	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	11	1.74399995803833

In the year 2000 Garrison, Anderson and Archer introduced CoI framework in order to find solutions to reduce the gaps in online learning and the framework that they have introduced has become the most referenced framework of study in online education so far. According to them, a very satisfactory education takes place within a community of inquiry which consists of teachers and students. Further they assume the learning takes place as a result of interaction among social, cognitive and teaching presence (Garrison, Anderson and Archher, 2000) Though the CoI framework has shaped many studies of e learning in higher education, it is highly recommended that much more research work should be done on this framework to clarify the mounting body of disconfirming evidence.	2017		0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	1	-0.6940000057220459

Kinematic parameters were gained by two dimension analyser Consport Motion Analysis System (CMAS) There are involved 19 female pole vault jumpers with sport performance 408.1 490.5 cm (average result 431.2 cm) From the point of biomechanical movement activity analyse we consider as a more objective performance criterion (dependent variable) maximal centre of gravity height that were reached at valid attempts by female pole vault jumpers. By two dimension (2 D) analyse of group of female pole vault jumpers there were revealed 76 independent variables that entered into process of multiple correlation and regression analysis. On 1st sport structure performance factor level we isolated two complex parameters absolute grip and standing over by which we can explain dependent variable maximal centre of gravity height on 100% With stated proceeding we could separate seven factors on 2nd level. Three of the parameters horizontal speed of centre of gravity at moment of take off end, centre of gravity height at moment of take off end and operating angle during take off are bound with explanation of absolute grip variable. Four others parameters vertical speed of centre of gravity at the end of pull with turn, centre of gravity height at moment of end of lifting, time duration of take off and climb angle explain standing over. 14 more factors are found on 3rd sport structure performance level. Thus we succeeded in this process to reduce number of decisive variables with their mutual relationships and hierarchy. Transparent and simplified model of female pole vault sport performance structure enables to coaches and jumpers improve technical training.	2017		0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	2	-0.44999998807907104

The present study is to investigate the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of the Hooghly estuary, with specific reference to stability of Eden navigational fairway and permanent operation of the channel as a possible main navigational route to HDC in the place of Auckland channel from the Bay of Bengal. Impact of stoppage of dredging at Auckland bar on the other channels (Eden and the Rangafalla channel that connect to Kolkata Dock System, KDS) is investigated. Simulations involving different scenarios like Auckland channel dredged and non dredged conditions are considered to investigate the stability of the Eden channel and also to address the aspects relating to the maintenance of other channels. In the study, for the Auckland open condition, the predicted siltation levels are of about 8 12 cm over Auckland and about 4 8 cm over Eden bar, over 15 days of simulation. For Auckland closed condition and for Auckland with two tracks, the results indicate a marginal reduction in siltation over the entire Eden area, and it is also observed that the siltation in Jellingham and Haldi River confluence is significantly reduced. For the monsoon conditions in all the above scenarios, the results, as per the siltation patterns and as per the siltation levels on the edges of the channels, indicate that there will be a marginal increase in siltation, by about 20% when higher silt load is considered. The study suggests that Eden channel could continuously be used with little dredging in the longer term of more than 5 years with monitoring and realignment of the channel to cater for movement of sandbars. Further, non dredging of Auckland channel may not have any bearing on the operation of Eden, Jellingham and Rangafalla channels.	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

BRAF mutations that constitutively activate MAPK signalling and bypass the need for upstream stimuli occur with high prevalence in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. In this report we characterize the novel, potent, and selective BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (GSK2118436) Cellular inhibition of BRAFV600E kinase activity by dabrafenib resulted in decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation through an initial G1 cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death. In a BRAFV600E containing xenograft model of human melanoma, orally administered dabrafenib inhibited ERK activation, downregulated Ki67, and upregulated p27, leading to tumor growth inhibition. However, as reported for other BRAF inhibitors, dabrafenib also induced MAPK pathway activation in wild type BRAF cells through CRAF (RAF1) signalling, potentially explaining the squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas arising in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors. In addressing this issue, we showed that concomitant administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogated paradoxical BRAF inhibitor induced MAPK signalling in cells, reduced the occurrence of skin lesions in rats, and enhanced the inhibition of human tumor xenograft growth in mouse models. Taken together, our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for dabrafenib as a specific and highly efficacious BRAF inhibitor and provide evidence for its potential clinical benefits when used in combination with a MEK inhibitor.	2013	PloS one	0.43799999356269836	1.6293599605560303	15	2.7200000286102295

Nowadays, many edge detection methods create doubts in choosing the right edge detection method and according to image conditions. Based on the problems, a study was conducted to compare the performance of edge detection using methods of canny, Sobel and laplacian by using object of rice field. The program was created by using the Python programming language on OpenCV. The result of the study on one image test that the Canny method produces thin and smooth edges and did not omit the important information on the image while it has required a lot of computing time. Classification is generally started from the data acquisition process; pre processing and post processing. Canny edge detection can detect actual edges with minimum error rates and produce optimal image edges. The threshold value obtained from the Canny method was the best and optimal threshold value for each method. The result of a test by comparing the three methods showed that the Canny edge detection method gives better results in determining the rice field boundary, which was 90% compared to Sobel 87% and laplacian 89%	2019	EPI International Journal of Engineering	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

More pertinently, we term them as Lambert W kink type solitons, begotten under the influence of intrapulse Raman scattering. Parameter domains are delineated in which these optical solitons exit in the ensuing model. We report the effect of model coefficients on the amplitude of Lambert W kink solitons, which enables us to control efficiently the pulse intensity and hence their subsequent evolution. Also, moving fronts or optical shock type solitons are obtained as a byproduct of this model. We explicate the mechanism to control the intensity of these fronts, by fine tuning the spectral filtering or gain parameter. It is exhibited that the frequency chirp associated with these optical solitons depends on the intensity of the wave and saturates to a constant value as the retarded time approaches its asymptotic value.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	5	0.2809999883174896

Meanwhile, new immersive and high stake control applications with much stricter reliability, latency and scalability requirements are posing unprecedented challenges in terms of system design and algorithmic solutions. This article aspires at providing a fresh and in depth look into URLLC by first examining the limitations of 5G URLLC, and putting forward key research directions for the next generation of URLLC, coined eXtreme ultra reliable and low latency communication (xURLLC) xURLLC is underpinned by three core concepts: (1) it leverages recent advances in machine learning (ML) for faster and reliable data driven predictions; (2) it fuses both radio frequency (RF) and non RF modalities for modeling and combating rare events without sacrificing spectral efficiency; and (3) it underscores the much needed joint communication and control co design, as opposed to the communication centric 5G URLLC. The intent of this article is to spearhead beyond 5G/6G mission critical applications by laying out a holistic vision of xURLLC, its research challenges and enabling technologies, while providing key insights grounded in selected use cases.	2020	ArXiv	0.875	3.255000114440918	7	0.7689999938011169

This paradigm forms the basis of clinical trial null hypotheses, where trials are built to test the null hypothesis: patients garner no overall survival benefit from targeting metastatic lesions. However, with advancing imaging technology and increasingly precise techniques for targeting lesions, a much larger proportion of metastatic disease can be treated. As a result, the life extending benefit of targeting metastatic disease is becoming increasingly clear. In this work, we suggest shifting this qualitative null hypothesis, and describe a mathematical model which can be used to frame a new, quantitative null. We begin with a very simple formulation of tumor growth, an exponential function, and use it to show that while any amount of cell kill will extend survival, in many cases the extent is so small as to be unnoticeable in a clinical context or out weighed by factors related to toxicity and treatment time. Recasting the null in these quantitative terms will allow trialists to design trials specifically to increase understanding of what circumstances (patient selection, disease burden, tumor growth kinetics) can lead to improved OS when targeting metastatic lesions, rather than whether or not targeting metastases extends survival for patients with (oligo )metastatic disease.	2020	medRxiv	0.875	3.255000114440918	2	-0.44999998807907104

In this paper, a parametric modeling method of graded lattice structure is proposed. The continuum damage model is used to evaluate the failure load of the structures. In this paper, two types of graded lattice structure are built by parametric modeling method: the cell size changed graded lattice structure (the densities of the structures are constant) and the bar width changed graded lattice structure (the masses of the structures are constant) The failure loads of the structures under three point bending load are investigated. The results show that the smaller middle cell improves the bending failure load of the cell size changed graded lattice structures up to 52% and the wider sandwich bar in the middle of the structure improves the bending failure load of the Bar width changed graded lattice structures up to 31% Meanwhile, the graded parameter of the structures will influence the failure mode of the structures.	2019	Journal of Sandwich Structures Materials	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716

Focusing on partially linear models, we extend the Double ML framework to allow for (1) a number of treatments that may grow with the sample size and (2) the analysis of panel data under sequentially exogenous errors. Our low dimensional treatment (LD) regime directly extends the work in [Chernozhukov et al. 2016] by showing that the coefficients from a second stage, ordinary least squares estimator attain root n convergence and desired coverage even if the dimensionality of treatment is allowed to grow. In a high dimensional sparse (HDS) regime, we show that second stage LASSO and debiased LASSO have asymptotic properties equivalent to oracle estimators with no upstream error. We argue that these advances make Double ML methods a desirable alternative for practitioners estimating short term demand elasticities in non contractual settings. *We would like to thank Vasilis Syrgkanis, Whitney Newey, Anna Mikusheva, Brian Quistorff and participants of MIT Econometrics Lunch for valuable comments. ar X iv :1 71 2. 09 98 8v 2 st at .M L 1 0 Ja n 20 18	2018		0.75	2.7899999618530273	1	-0.6940000057220459

60	218726195	218726195	The Impact of Service Learning Course Characteristics on University Students' Learning Outcomes.	"Undergraduate students 'reports of their service learning course experiences and their gains fivm participation in those courses were investigated with a sample of 250 students at Tulane University. The students completed a survey in which they rated their service learning courses in terms of three aspects: Value of Service, Focus on Service, and Opportunities for Reflection. These course attributes predicted students' reported outcomes from service learning, including Learning about the Community, Academic Learning, Gains in Problem solving and Leadership Skills, and Satisfaction with the University. A Social Change orientation in the service learning course contributed independently to the prediction of outcomes. Replicating an earlier study, a ""match"" between student preferences for service orientations and the nature of service experienced was shown to predict service learning course outcomes for students who expressed a positive orientation preference. In a previous study, Moely and Ilustre (2013a) showed that longitudinal changes in certain civic attitudes and knowledge were related to the experiences that students had at a university characterized by a strong commitment to community engagement. In this paper, we attempt to identify aspects of students' experiences, especially related to their service learning courses, that were important for learning outcomes. The importance of students' own preferences for different kinds of service was also investigated. The students' experiences in service learning were examined through a consideration of the quality of their service learning courses. The National Youth Leadership Council has published standards for high quality service learning for Grades K through 12 (Billig, 2007) The eight ""promising practices"" for K 12 service learning that Billig describes are curriculum integration, ongoing cognitively challenging reflection activities, youth voice, respect for diversity, meaningful service, progress and process monitoring, duration of service learning activity, and reciprocal partnerships. Many scholars have addressed the issue of high quality service learning in higher education, but there is still limited research on the effects of course characteristics on student outcomes. Bringle, Hatcher, and Muthiah (2010) conducted one of the few efforts to date to measure service learning course quality. They were interested in whether service learning participation might affect retention in college and to study this, compared the effects of service learning participation with that of enrollment in non service learning courses. To index quality for both service learning and non service learning courses, they developed a 24 item ""Quality of the Learning Environment"" scale. Items concerned the extent of peer and faculty interaction, course satisfaction, perceived learning, degree of active learning, and personal relevance. They found that course quality was important as a mediator of service learning effects on students' plans for continued study at the university and their actual re enrollment the following year. Furco and Moely (2006) developed a 12 item scale to measure course quality, aimed more specifically at service learning. They found, in a large, multi campus study, that course quality was predictive of service learning outcomes reported by college students. The same scale was used in a longitudinal study at Tulane (Moely Ilustre, 2011, 2013a) from which the data for the present study were derived. In the present study, factor analysis and content analysis were used to group the course quality items into three categories, providing a more detailed description of service learning course quality: Value of Service, Focus on Service, and Opportunities for Reflection. Value of Service reflects Billig's category ""meaningful service"" but adds self evaluation items about how well the service was performed. Focus on Service includes integration of the service component with the academic course content, similar to Billig's ""curriculum integration, "" as well as preparation of both students and community agencies for the student's service."	2014		0.5	1.8600000143051147	2	-0.44999998807907104

However, two dimensional matrix factorization models may not be able to cope with the recommendation problem that involves additional criterion specific rating data. This study introduces a tensor factorization method to handle three dimensional user item criterion rating data. Moreover, we observe that using single global tensor factorization alone may not be sufficient to characterize diverse preferences among different groups of users, and a combined global and local tensor factorization method (GLTF) for multi criteria recommendation is thus proposed. One key benefit of the GLTF is that it can leverage global user item criterion rating patterns while also exploiting local user subset specific rating behaviors to jointly infer the latent factor representations for users, items, and specific item criteria. Experimental results, which used real life data available to the public, demonstrated that the GLTF is superior to well established baseline methods.	2020	Patterns	0.875	3.255000114440918	6	0.5249999761581421

In this study, we examine patterns of body mass evolution in Felidae (Placentalia, Carnivora) to assess the effects of phylogeny, mode of evolution, and the relationship between body mass and prey choice in this charismatic mammalian clade. Our data set includes 39 extant and 26 extinct taxa, with published body mass data supplemented by estimates based on condylobasal length. These data were run through 'SURFACE' and 'bayou' to test for patterns of body mass evolution and convergence between taxa. Body masses of felids are significantly different among prey choice groupings (small, mixed and large) We find that body mass evolution in cats is strongly influenced by phylogeny, but different patterns emerged depending on inclusion of extinct taxa and assumptions about branch lengths. A single Ornstein Uhlenbeck optimum best explains the distribution of body masses when first occurrence data were used for the fossil taxa. However, when mean occurrence dates or last known occurrence dates were used, two selective optima for felid body mass were recovered in most analyses: a small optimum around 5 kg and a large one around 100 kg. Across living and extinct cats, we infer repeated evolutionary convergences towards both of these optima, but, likely due to biased extinction of large taxa, our results shift to supporting a Brownian motion model when only extant taxa are included in analyses.	2015	Journal of evolutionary biology	0.5619999766349792	2.090640068054199	6	0.5249999761581421

How can we train such a classifier when data on the protected group is difficult to attain? In many settings, finding out the sensitive input attribute can be prohibitively expensive even during model training, and sometimes impossible during model serving. For example, in recommender systems, if we want to predict if a user will click on a given recommendation, we often do not know many attributes of the user, e.g. race or age, and many attributes of the content are hard to determine, e.g. the language or topic. Thus, it is not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the sensitive attribute. Here, we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural network. In particular, we study how the choice of data for the adversarial training effects the resulting fairness properties. We find two interesting results: a small amount of data is needed to train these adversarial models, and the data distribution empirically drives the adversary's notion of fairness."	2017	ArXiv	0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	4	0.03700000047683716

Blended learning combines traditional teaching and self learning using internet resources, leading to develop autonomy of trainees. Content curation is still a recent concept with applications in marketing but less in use for teaching and learning in colleges and universities. Methods Implementation of content curation tools (Scoop.it preferred because of potential) for blended learning and information literacy training during 5 years of #400 french (and chinese in the context of Nancy Wuhan medical training program) students in two knowledge domains: immunology in medical university, geography in ""classes preparatoires litteraires"" Results: Teachers opened and maintained one or more general topics related to the discipline as well as topics focusing on annual examinations programs. Students opened and maintained during various periods of time (from months to years) topics of their choice in related areas. They were evaluated on number of posts, regularity of posting, commentaries and tagging, pictures, sharing on social networks and impact of their topic. Discussion: Content curation allowed teachers to select relevant resources in rapidly evolving topics and share them with students. Using curation, researchers followed scientific knowledge evolution, detected new topics, build interest networks and became thought leaders. Content curation allowed students to (1) acquire and develop information, media and digital literacy learning by practicing focused information research, (2) discover usage of diverse resources (primary documents, secondary information, databases, press releases. (3) develop critical minds about sources and contents. Content curation stimulated reading, analyzing and mastering digital information, helping create scientific watching competencies. Reading, tagging, commenting information in foreign languages helps students improve reading and writing fluency. Students were able to build information portfolios, create their digital identity, useful for recruiting interviews. Content curation should be used in teaching in the context of blended learning programs to train students and trainees for multimodal literacy as well as future work capacities, research competencies and lifelong learning."	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	2	-0.44999998807907104

As times goes on, It is widely recognized that transfer learning methods are effective for low resource language problems. However, existing transfer learning methods are typically based on the parent child architecture, which does not adequately take advantages of helpful languages. In this paper, inspired by human transitive inference and learning ability, we handle this issue by proposing a new hierarchical transfer learning architecture for low resource languages. In the architecture, the NMT model is trained in the unrelated high resource language pair, the similar intermediate language pair and the low resource language pair in turn. Correspondingly, the parameters are transferred and fine tuned layer by layer for initialization. In this way, our hierarchical transfer learning architecture simultaneously combines the data volume advantages of high resource languages and the syntactic similarity advantages of cognate languages. Specially, we utilize Byte Pair Encoding(BPE) and character level embedding for data pre processing, which effectively solve the problem of out of vocabulary(OOV) Experimental results on Uygur Chinese and Turkish English translation demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed architecture over the NMT model with parent child architecture.	2019	IEEE Access	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	5	0.2809999883174896

Juices were pasteurized at 97 o C for 5 mins and stored for 35 days in PET bottles at refrigerated temperature. The TSS and pH of the different types of juice were found in the range of 7.73 to 8.53 and 4.33 to 4.53 respectively. Maximum acidity (0.785% and vitamin C (37.1 mg/100 ml) were found in the sample A (in a ratio 1:1) Aerobic plate count was found within the range of (92 x 10 6 to 233x 10 6 cfu/ml. The produced juice blends were subjected to chemical and sensory evaluation at one week interval for five weeks storage time. The chemical analysis showed that, there is a gradual decrease in titratable acidity and Vitamin C along the storage period. TSS and pH increased progressively during storage period. The mean overall acceptability scores of more than 8 for juice samples indicated the commercial scope for manufacturing good and nutritious pineapple juice blended with orange juice. From all the analysis, it can be observed that the juice blend can be kept conveniently for three weeks without preservatives and 28 days with sodium benzoate at the rate of 0.6 mg/L.

68	51797392	51797392	MULTIPLE INTENTIONS	Recent advances in learning from demonstrations (LfD) with deep neural networks have enabled learning complex robot skills that involve high dimensional perception such as raw image inputs. LfD algorithms generally assume learning from single task demonstrations. In practice, however, it is more efficient for a teacher to demonstrate a multitude of tasks without careful task set up, labeling, and engineering. Unfortunately in such cases, traditional imitation learning techniques fail to represent the multi modal nature of the data, and often result in sub optimal behavior. In this paper we present an LfD approach for learning multiple modes of behavior from visual data. Our approach is based on a stochastic deep neural network (SNN) which represents the underlying intention in the demonstration as a stochastic activation in the network. We present an efficient algorithm for training SNNs, and for learning with vision inputs, we also propose an architecture that associates the intention with a stochastic attention module. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method on real robot visual object reaching tasks, and show that it can reliably learn the multiple behavior modes in the demonstration data.

As such, auto encoder structures, a type of classical unsupervised method, have recently been utilized in this field. These structures consist of an encoder followed by a decoder and are typically adopted to restructure a current input frame or predict a future frame. However, regardless of whether a 2D or 3D autoencoder structure is adopted, only single scale information from the previous layer is typically used in the decoding process. This can result in a loss of detail that could potentially be used to predict or reconstruct video frames. As such, this study proposes a novel spatio temporal U Net for frame prediction using normal events and abnormality detection using prediction error. This framework combines the benefits of U Nets in representing spatial information with the capabilities of ConvLSTM for modeling temporal motion data. In addition, we propose a new regular score function, consisting of a prediction error for not only the current frame but also future frames, to further improve the accuracy of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on common anomaly datasets, including UCSD (98 video clips in total) and CUHK Avenue (30 video clips in total) validated the performance of the proposed technique and we achieved 96.5% AUC for the Ped2 dataset, which is much better than existing autoencoder based and U Net based methods.	2019	IEEE Access	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	5	0.2809999883174896

Coordinated changes in energy metabolism develop to support gestation and lactation in the periparturient dairy cow. Maternal physiology involves the partitioning of nutrients (i.e. glucose, amino acids and fatty acids (FA) for fetal growth and milk synthesis. However, the inability of the dairy cow to successfully adapt to a productive lactation may trigger metabolic stress characterized by uncontrolled adipose tissue lipolysis and reduced insulin sensitivity. A consequence is lipotoxicity and hepatic triglyceride deposition that favors the development of fatty liver disease (FLD) and ketosis. This review describes contemporary perspectives pertaining to FA surfeit and complex lipid metabolism in the transition dairy cow. The role of saturated and unsaturated FA as bioactive signaling molecules capable of modulating insulin secretion and sensitivity is explored. Moreover, the metabolic fate of FA as influenced by mitochondrial function is considered. This includes the influence of inadequate mitochondrial oxidation on acylcarnitine status and the use of FA for lipid mediator synthesis. Lipid mediators, including the sphingolipid ceramide and diacylglycerol, are evaluated considering their established ability to inhibit insulin signaling and glucose transport in non ruminant diabetics. The mechanisms of FLD in the transition cow are revisited with attention centered on glycerophospholipid phosphatidylcholine and triglyceride secretion. The relationship between oxidative stress and oxylipids within the context of insulin antagonism, hepatic steatosis and inflammation is also reviewed. Lastly, peripartal hormonal involvement or lack thereof of adipokines (i.e. leptin, adiponectin) and hepatokines (i.e. fibroblast growth factor 21) is described. Similarities and differences in ruminant and non ruminant physiology are routinely showcased. Unraveling the lipidome of the dairy cow has generated breakthroughs in our understanding of periparturient lipid biology. Therapeutic approaches that target FA and complex lipid metabolism holds promise to enhance cow health, well being and productive lifespan.	2020	Animal an international journal of animal bioscience	0.875	3.255000114440918	1	-0.6940000057220459

The non degree courses are divided into three categories, such as the professional knowledge class, the subject progress class and the scientific research skill class. Through the implementation, the innovative consciousness and the innovation ability of the graduate students are preliminarily improved, and the aim of objective evaluation can be achieved. Introduction In the curriculum of postgraduate training in our country, degree courses refer to the courses of basic theory and professional knowledge, and non degree courses refer to professional elective courses, including experimental skills training courses selected according to research directions and frontiers knowledge courses, research design and thesis writing skills courses, etc. Degree courses can train the basic abilities of graduate students, while non degree courses develop graduate research skills and innovative abilities. Therefore, we should strengthen the management of non degree courses, because it is an indispensable link to ensure the training quality of graduate students, especially to improve their scientific research skills and innovation ability. On the College level [1 3] it is imperative to perfect the examination system of non degree courses. The Necessity of Perfecting the Examination System of Non degree Courses Perfecting the evaluation system of non degree courses is conducive to standardizing the teaching behavior of teaching teachers. In general, the examination of ""English"" and ""Politics"" in the public compulsory courses in degree courses is organized by the University, and the examination of the basic theory and professional knowledge is often arranged by the College, and the teacher is responsible for the assessment of non degree courses. From the actual situation at present, the management of non degree courses in colleges and even disciplines is rare. That is, the assessment of the non degree course is the responsibility of the teaching teacher, and the teaching effect and the teaching quality are completely related to the teacher's level and sense of responsibility, but some teachers do not pay attention to what graduate students need to learn, and part of the knowledge that they teach is the repetition or continuation of the undergraduate course[4] Therefore, the examination requirement of non degree course is relatively loose, and it often cannot play a role of supervision, diagnosis, correct evaluation, and significantly improve the innovative ability of graduate students. At the same time, it cannot promote the cultivation of good style of study and teaching style. Therefore, it is necessary to establish or perfect the evaluation system of non degree courses for postgraduates. Perfecting the examination system of Non degree courses is beneficial to the cultivation of Graduate students' innovative ability. The innovation refers to the existing thinking mode, which is different from the traditional or ordinary thinking. The core of graduate training is the cultivation of scientific research and innovation ability. Most of the non degree courses are related to the cultivation of innovation ability, but the improvement of innovation ability is affected by many International Conference on Education Reform and Management Science (ERMS 2018) Copyright (c) 2018, the Authors.

We investigate a projection based model in which we first translate Chinese and Arabic into English, run a publicly available coreference system, and then use a new projection algorithm to map the coreferring entities back from English into mention candidates detected in the Chinese and Arabic source. We compare to a baseline that just runs the English coreference system on the supplied parses for Chinese and Arabic. Because our method does not beat the baseline system on the development set, we submit outputs generated by the baseline system as our final submission.	2012	EMNLP CoNLL Shared Task	0.375	1.3949999809265137	2	-0.44999998807907104

The VO2 and Mo/VO2/Mo films with a VO2 thickness of 300 nm were prepared on quartz glass substrates: the former was used for the characterization of electrical properties, and the latter was used for the thermal conductivity measurement. The VO2 films were deposited by reactive rf magnetron sputtering using a V2O3 target and an Ar O2 mixture gas at 645 K. The VO2 films consisted of single phase VO2 as confirmed by X ray diffraction and electron beam diffraction. With increased temperature, the electrical resistivity of the VO2 film decreased abruptly from 6.3 x 10 1 to 5.3 x 10 4 O cm across the TMIT of around 325 340 K. The thermal conductivity of the VO2 film increased from 3.6 to 5.4 W m 1 K 1 across the TMIT. This discontinuity and temperature dependence of thermal conductivity can be explained by the phonon heat conduction and the Wiedemann Franz law.	2015		0.5619999766349792	2.090640068054199	7	0.7689999938011169

Initially a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used to classify partial boundary images of pepper leaves. After the partial leaf boundary detection, active shape models (ASMs) are subsequently built to employ the images of entire leaves based on a priori knowledge using landmark. Two deformable models were developed with pepper leaves: Boundary ASM and MLP ASM. Matching processes are carried out by deforming the trained leaf models to fit real leaf images collected in the greenhouse. MLP ASM detected 76.7 and 87.8% of overlapping and occluded pepper leaves respectively, while Boundary ASM showed detection rates of 63.4 and 76.7% The detection rates by the conventional ASM were 23.3 and 29.3% The leaf models trained with pepper leaves were further tested with leaves of paprika, in the same family but with more complex shapes (e.g. holes and rolling) Although the overall detection rates were somewhat lower than those for pepper, the rates for the occluded and overlapping leaves of paprika were still higher with MLP ASM (ranging from 60.4 to 76.7% and Boundary ASM (ranging from 50.5 to 63.3% than using the conventional active shape model (from 21.6 to 30.0% The modified active shape models with the boundary classifier could be an efficient means for detecting multiple leaves in field conditions.

77	85494264	85494264	Anti inflammatory Effect of Ghrelin in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines From Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder	The gut hormone ghrelin has been implicated in a variety of functional roles in the central nervous system through the brain gut axis, one of which is an anti inflammatory effect. An aberrant brain gut axis producing immune dysfunction has been implicated in the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and elevated expression of inflammatory markers has been shown in blood and brain tissue from subjects with ASD. We hypothesized that ghrelin may mitigate this effect. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from typically developed children (TD C) (N 20) and children with ASD (ASD C) (N 20) were cultured with PBS or human ghrelin (0.01 mM) for 24 h, and mRNA expression levels of the inflammation related molecules interleukin 1b (IL 1b) interleukin 6 (IL 6) tumor necrosis factor a (TNF a) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB) were measured to examine the effects of ghrelin as an anti inflammatory agent. Expression levels of TNF a and NF kB mRNA, but not IL 1b or IL 6, were significantly elevated in ASD C compared to TD C. Ghrelin showed a tendency to reduce the expression of TNF a and NF kB, but this was not statistically significant. Considering the heterogenous pathobiology of ASD, we examined the effects of ghrelin on TD C and ASD C with expression levels of TNF a and NF kB in the highest and lowest quartiles. We found that ghrelin markedly reduced mRNA expression of TNF a and NF kB s in ASD C with highest quartile expression, but there were no effects in ASD C with lowest quartile expression, TD C with highest quartile expression, or TD C with lowest quartile expression. Together, these findings suggest that ghrelin has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for ASD with inflammation and/or immune dysfunction.	2019	Front.

78	216846342	216846342	The Theoretical Construction of Leibniz's Monadology	"Leibniz's Monadology is constructed by combining analysis with synthesis. With the help of ancient Greek atomic theory and on the basis of its inheritance and improvement, he thinks that the monad is the foundation of all things in the world. Expounding the specific meaning and characteristics of monad in his book ""Monadology"" Leibniz thought that God is a monad of monad. It is the existence of God that unites the disordered monad and makes the world a harmonious cosmic order. Therefore, God chose the best of all possible worlds for us, because our world must contain the greatest and most possible of the best, and use the principle of ""pre established harmony"" to explain the conditions of the existing world. He placed the whole philosophical system in the framework of monad theory and opened up another kind of philosophical thinking. Keywords Leibniz, Monad, Monadology, God, Pre Established Harmonious In the history of Western philosophy, the concept of monad can be traced back to the ancient Greek era Democritus' atomic theory that the tangible atom is the real entity. Until modern times,Leibniz originally put forward the concept of ""monad"" in order to solve the problem of continuous transition between entities in modern philosophy. Monad is put forward on the basis of the concept of atom, but they are not the same. Atom is a passive, non divisible, non independent material entity, while monad is a kind of entity which does not have extensive or quantitative specifications but only has a certain quality.Leibniz's concept of a single molecule is much broader than that of an atom, In Leibniz's view, the monad is the element of things, each monad has its own internal structure and the law of action, are completely different from other monads, but the whole universe constitutes a harmonious system between numerous monads. Therefore, the monad is a non material spiritual entity, which is the most basic unit of the universe. The world composed of the monad is a continuous sequence. I. THE CONNOTATION OF LEIBNIZ'S MONADOLOGY A. Definition of Monad According to Leibniz's philosophical theory, the entity of all things in the universe is not a single atom as Democritus said, nor is it the three entity of matter, spirit and God described by Descartes, a theorist, but a plurality of monads .He said, ""monad, a Greek word means"" one ""or"" simple. "" Complex entities or substances are numerous, simple entities, life entities, soul entities, spiritual entities are simple. There are simple entities everywhere. It should be everywhere, because there is no simple entity without complex entities.[1] In Leibniz's view, the entity is positive, active, with its own vitality and energy. The monomorphic entity must exist, it is not extensive and passive, and does not rely on external forces to promote. Therefore, it is an objective existence. It is a simple entity without complex shape, and its quantity is huge. B. Characteristics of Monad Simplicity. Simplicity is the most basic characteristic of Leibniz's monad theory. Monads are spiritual things. They do not possess material entities and can also be regarded as ""one"" So Leibniz argues that a monad as a world entity must be something that can no longer be divided, the simplest thing. In addition, the monad ""since there are complexes, there must be pure entities, because the complex is nothing more than a group or a bunch of simple things""[2] It can also be said that only with simple entities can it become everything. The so called ""simplicity"" means that there is no shape, no size, no extension of the pure entity must be spiritual entity, because only the spirit is the simplest entity, it has the ""no part"" characteristics. Therefore, the monads are purely spiritual entities. Variety. Leibniz believes that the number of monads is infinite. First of all, because there is no extension of the number of monads, so its number can not be expressed in terms of simple physical quantities. Secondly, this is also the intrinsic requirement of ""compounding"" in the complex. Since ""compounding"" means the aggregation of many simple substances, the number of monads can not be quantified. Thirdly, the monad has the property of physical particle, and the physical particle of the same object is infinite, then, the monad is infinite. Initiative. In Leibniz's view, to establish the cause of the movement of all things in the universe, it is necessary to go beyond the scope of sensible matter, and to recognize the dynamic nature of the entity that constitutes everything in an insensible world. Monads are spiritual, and only the spirit is dynamic, to avoid material changes, so the monads are dynamic. Initiative is the nature of the general entity. Leibniz's monad theory also has an important concept ""force"" he believes that the entity itself has a dynamic force, this force exists only in itself, each single is under its impetus to constantly move and change, and become the basic elements of things. Qualitative Differences. Leibniz thinks that every monad is different from any individual monad. Because there are no two identities in nature, it is impossible to find an intrinsic difference or a distinction based on an intrinsic trait.[3] Leibniz 2018 8th International Conference on Education, Management, Computer and Society (EMCS 2018) Copyright (c) (2018) Francis Academic Press, UK DOI: 10.25236/emcs.2018.141 569 emphasizes that the difference between things must be distinguished qualitatively, because the undifferentiated things can only be the same thing, there can not be exactly the same thing, different quality determines the existence of different monads. Therefore, there is no qualitative difference between monads. Self Motivation. Monad has no parts, it can not be further divided. But monad is developing continuously. Contrary to the fact that the atom must rely on its own external impetus, the evolution of the monad cannot come from external sources, but from internal causes. Therefore, the monad must be the cause of its own production, there is a certain degree of ""self sufficiency"" between them, it is itself the cause of their own movement. So Leibniz believes that the birth and death of the monad can not be produced or eliminated by natural means, only from God's creation or destruction.[4] Independence. Because monad has no part or extension, other monads can not enter its interior to cause any change. It can neither increase nor decrease, and do not interrelate with each other. No object can enter the monad from outside because it ""has no window for something to go in."" [5]Monads are closed and isolated. They can not have any influence or effect on all monads around them. Therefore, the isolation of monads also guarantees the value of monads. C. Classification of Monads The number of monads in the universe is infinite, and the countless monads are graded according to the degree of clarity of their perception. According to the clarity of the list, it can be divided into four different types: The first is the lowest monad, which is made up of some inanimate inorganic substances and plants. This kind of monad does not have any cognitive ability in itself, nor does it have clear and clear representation, nor does it have the function of memory and consciousness. But it has a weak micro perception of other things, also known as ""naked monad"" Such monads exist only in thought, and are abstract products. The second is the kind of monad with clear perception and memory, which can also be continuous, but not conscious or rational. They are made up of the soul of animals, though they are only perceptual souls, but they can be called real souls. The third is a monad composed of the human soul, which is more advanced than the previous two. It not only has clear perception and self consciousness, but also has the ability of perception and rational thinking, and can use concepts for reasoning, judgment and other thinking activities. This ""spiritual monad"" can also be called ""spiritual soul"" or ""rational soul"" by rational reflection to understand their own knowledge. The fourth is the highest order, that is, God.God's omniscience, omnipotence, and perfection determine that it is a monad, and that it possesses the most complete wisdom and ability, which is why it created other monads, and through God's relatively independent monad it is universally linked and interacted. God is the creator of monad, the aim of all monads, and the fountain of eternal truth.[6] II. PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONIOUS SYSTEM OF LEIBNIZ'S MONADOLOGY From the above discussion of the monads, we can see that there is no correlation between the monads, and they move and change in isolation according to their own will, completely independent of other monads. The world is made up of countless monads, and monad can be regarded as a mirror of the universe. In this way, these monads will intertwine chaotically and become the ultimate cause of all things in the world, and then our world will become disorderly and chaotic. In fact, however, this is not the case. The world we live in is so harmonious and orderly that it requires a premise for all monads to change and develop in unison. [7]Therefore, when Leibniz's monad theory develops to the critical moment, it inevitably leads to the appearance of God. In Leibniz's view, God is the highest form. God connects different forms in concept. It is God who makes the forms interdependent and coordinated. And all the monads were created by God, who cared and interfered with the change and development of the world from beginning to end, and arranged the trajectory of all the monads in advance. The change of each monad is the development of its own nature, and the other monads also play their respective roles, but the monads can develop in harmony and make it a continuous whole. The power to form this harmonious cosmic order is God, who creates and keeps the existing order in order. God is everything. The"	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	1	-0.6940000057220459

It is a debilitating condition that can occur spontaneously (primary or idiopathic adhesive capsulitis) or following shoulder surgery or trauma (secondary adhesive capsulitis) Here, we review the pathophysiology of adhesive shoulder capsulitis, highlighting its clinical presentation, natural history, risk factors, pathoanatomy and pathogenesis. Both current non operative and operative treatments for adhesive capsulitis are described, and evidence based studies are presented in support for or against each corresponding treatment. Finally, the review also provides an update on the gene expression profile of adhesive capsulitis and how this new understanding can help facilitate development of novel pharmacological therapies.	2017	Shoulder elbow	0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	4	0.03700000047683716
80	196642101	196642101	Near optimal combination of disparity across a log polar scaled visual field	The human visual system is foveated: we can see fine spatial details in central vision, whereas resolution is poor in our peripheral visual field, and this loss of resolution follows an approximately logarithmic decrease. Additionally, our brain organizes visual input in polar coordinates. Therefore, the image projection occurring between retina and primary visual cortex can be mathematically described by the log polar transform. Here, we test and model how this space variant visual processing affects how we process binocular disparity, a key component of human depth perception. We observe that the fovea preferentially processes disparities at fine spatial scales, whereas the visual periphery is tuned for coarse spatial scales, in line with the naturally occurring distributions of depths and disparities in the real world. We further show that the visual field integrates disparity information across the visual field, in a near optimal fashion. We develop a foveated, log polar model that mimics the processing of depth information in primary visual cortex and that can process disparity directly in the cortical domain representation. This model takes real images as input and recreates the observed topography of disparity sensitivity in man. Our findings support the notion that our foveated, binocular visual system has been moulded by the statistics of our visual environment. Author summary We investigate how humans perceive depth from binocular disparity at different spatial scales and across different regions of the visual field. We show that small changes in disparity defined depth are detected best in central vision, whereas peripheral vision best captures the coarser structure of the environment. We also demonstrate that depth information extracted from different regions of the visual field is combined into a unified depth percept. We then construct an image computable model of disparity processing that takes into account how our brain organizes the visual input at our retinae. The model operates directly in cortical image space, and neatly accounts for human depth perception across the visual field.	2020	PLoS Comput. Biol.	0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716

The study group of the research conducted with the relational screening model consists of 1561 students in the 5 th 6 th 7 th and 8 th grades from the cities located in six different regions of Turkey. Morphological awareness test and the reading comprehension tests developed separately for each grade were used in the collection of data obtained between the years of 2016 2018. According to the results, it was seen that the reading comprehension levels of the middle school students were moderate that there was a significant difference between the grades in terms of the success in the reading comprehension in favor of the upper grades, and that the female students had better reading comprehension skills compared to the male students. According to the other results obtained from the research, it was observed that the students in the 5 th and 6 th grades were at a low level in terms of morphological awareness, that the levels of the students in the 7 th and 8 th grades were moderate and that there was a significant difference among the grades and between the genders in terms of the success. Lastly, it was understood that there was a high level relationship between the reading comprehension and morphological awareness. Accordingly, it was determined that the success in morphological awareness was at a higher level in the students having a high rate of success in terms of reading comprehension, and that the students having lower morphological awareness got lower scores in reading comprehension tests.	2019	Dil ve Dilbilimi Calismalari Dergisi	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	1	-0.6940000057220459

Previous research in this area is scant and has produced contradictory findings (Blair et. al. 2001, 2004; Glass Newman, 2006; Kosson et al. 2002) One hundred and forty five male jail inmates, rated using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version participated in a facial affect recognition task. Participants were shown faces containing one of five emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, or shame) displayed at one of two different levels of intensity of expression (100% or 60% The authors predicted that psychopathy would be associated with decreased affect recognition, particularly for sad and fearful emotional expressions, and decreased recognition of less intense displays of facial affect. Results were largely consistent with expectations in that psychopathy was negatively correlated with overall facial recognition of affect, sad facial affect, and recognition of less intense displays of affect. An unexpected negative correlation with recognition of happy facial affect was also found. These results suggest that psychopathy may be associated with a general deficit in affect recognition.	2008	Personality and individual differences	0.125	0.4650000035762787	3	-0.2070000022649765

Paris was the birthplace of modernist art, Tokyo was the first city to receive a western painting in modern Asia and played an important role in nurturing the art of Asian modern art. Chinese artists from Shanghai, went to Tokyo and Paris to study western painting, providing evidence that Shanghai was influenced from Paris and Tokyo from this western painting communication. In addition to the inheriting relationship, international cooperation and interaction were also found. As a matter of fact, the three cities, Paris, Tokyo and Shanghai play an important role in the development of Chinese western painting. Artists were free to create, imitate the trend, exchange ideas and interact, which promoted the development of Chinese modern art.	2016		0.625	2.325000047683716	2	-0.44999998807907104

86	225858405	225858405	Methodology for wear mapping error quantification	"The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology to quantify the error on wear volume evaluation using optical interferometry with image analysis (OI+IA) to establish a lower threshold for wear mapping in practical applications.,A three dimensional surface wear map is quantified by measuring the same area of a surface before and after a wear process using optical interferometry. Then, by subtracting the matching images, the wear map (volume of wear) is obtained. To access the error related to wear mapping, the difference between several consecutive measurements of the same unworn surface was performed and deeply investigated.,The paper shows that the difference between two consecutive measurements of the same unworn surface, which ideally should be zero, is not. Thus, the magnitude of this ""wear map"" is the error. The main causes of such uncertainties are because of sample motion in a subpixel scale; a combination between surface roughness with the selected resolution; and numerical errors on the relocation process that is used to match the surfaces before subtracting them.,The proposed methodology allows one to define the lower threshold for wear map analysis using OI+IA. To know the limitation of OI+IA for wear mapping prevents misevaluation of the so called almost zero wear.,This paper covers and identifies main uncertainties and numerical errors related to optical interferometry assisted by image analysis for wear mapping. Several other papers deal with uncertainties of OI; however, this paper proposes a simple methodology to evaluate the lower threshold for wear mapping.,The peer review history for this article is available at: https:/publons.com/publon/10.1108/ILT 08 2019 0354"	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	2	-0.44999998807907104

Depending on the complexity of the case, the diagnostic phase can be lengthy and ridden with errors and delays. Such errors have a high likelihood to cause patients severe harm or even lead to their death and are estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system several hundred billion dollars each year. To avoid diagnostic errors, physicians increasingly rely on diagnostic decision support systems drawing from heuristics, historic cases, textbooks, clinical guidelines and scholarly biomedical literature. The evaluation of such systems, however, is often conducted in an ad hoc fashion, using non transparent methodology, and proprietary data. This paper presents DC3, a collection of 31 extremely difficult diagnostic case challenges, manually compiled and solved by clinical experts. For each case, we present a number of temporally ordered physician generated observations alongside the eventually confirmed true diagnosis. We additionally provide inferred dense relevance judgments for these cases among the PubMed collection of 27 million scholarly biomedical articles.	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

Since information in microblogs is highly dynamic, an up to date index coupled with pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) with an external corpus has a higher chance of retrieving more relevant documents and improving ranking. In this paper, we focus on the research question:how can we reduce the query expansion computational cost while maintaining the same retrieval precision as standard PRF? Therefore, we propose to accelerate the query expansion step of pseudo relevance feedback. The hypothesis is that using an expansion corpus organized into verticals for expanding the query, will lead to a more efficient query expansion process and improved retrieval effectiveness. Thus, the proposed query expansion method uses a distributed search architecture and resource selection algorithms to provide an efficient query expansion process. Experiments on the TREC Microblog datasets show that the proposed approach can match or outperform standard PRF in MAP and NDCG@30, with a computational cost that is three orders of magnitude lower.	2018	ICTIR	0.75	2.7899999618530273	3	-0.2070000022649765

Many microbial sources produce either intracellular or extracellular biopolymers. For example, Azotobacter vinelandii is a non pathogenic soil bacterium that produces alginate, an extracellular polysaccharide. Alginates are used mainly in the food and pharmaceutical industries as stabilizing, thickening, gel or film forming agents. Due to its characteristics of biocompatibility, biodegradability and non antigenicity, new applications for alginate are being discovered, such as biomaterial in the biomedical field and tissue engineering. It is well established that alginate is first synthesized as a polymannuronate from its cytosolic precursor. However, the mechanisms involved in the polymerization, modification (acetylation, epimerization and depolymerization) and translocation of alginate have been poorly elucidated. Two of the most important parameters in alginate production by A. vinelandii are dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) and the oxygen supply conditions, as these impact both the polymer concentration and its composition, particularly its molecular weight (MW) Several studies have revealed that increased alginate molecular weight occurs in oxygen limited conditions, specifically at oxygen concentrations near zero. This article reviews recent studies examining the influence of oxygen, under limitation (microaerophilic) and non limitation conditions (measured as DOT and oxygen transfer rate, OTR) on the polymerization and degradation of alginate produced by A. vinelandii. This review also provides evidence for understanding these processes at the cellular level and the effect of oxygen on alginate biosynthesis.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe the evolution of thoracoscopic spine surgery from basic endoscopic procedures using fluoroscopy and anatomical localization through developmental iterations to the current technology use in which endoscopy and image guided surgery are merged with intraoperative CT scanning. METHODS The authors provided detailed explanations of their thoracoscopic spine surgery techniques, beginning with their early generation endoscopy with fluoroscopic localization, which was followed with point surface matching techniques and early image guidance. The authors supplanted this with the modern era of image guidance, thoracoscopic spine surgery, and seamless integration that has reached its current level of refinement. RESULTS A retrospective review of single institution thoracoscopic procedures performed by the senior author over the course of 19 years yielded a total of 160 patients, including 73 women and 87 men. The mean patient age was 55 years, and the range included patients 16 94 years of age. There were no patients with worsened neurological function. One hundred sixteen patients underwent surgery for thoracic disc herniation, 18 for underlying neoplasms with spinal cord compression, 14 for osteomyelitis and discitis, 12 for thoracic deformity with neurological changes, and 8 for traumatic etiologies. CONCLUSIONS More than 19 years of experience has revealed the benefits of integrating thoracoscopic spine surgery with intraoperative CT scanning and image guided surgery, including direct decompression without manipulation of neural elements, superior 3D spatial orientation, and localization of complex spinal anatomy. With the exponential growth of machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence, and advances in imaging techniques and endoscopic imaging, there may be further refinements of this technique on the horizon.	2021	Neurosurgical focus	0.9380000233650208	3.4893600940704346	5	0.2809999883174896

Automated manipulators have been applied to hazardous environments and routine manufacturing functions. Because automated manipulators are nonlinear dynamic systems with a high degree of uncertainty, it is difficult to obtain precise dynamic equations to design control laws. VR is an important part of applications in industrial, medicine, statistics, and other areas where 3D object can help understand complex systems. In this application, interaction with the virtual system can be enhanced by a sense of touch, and rapid feedback can be used to apply representative forces from the virtual environment to a human user. The ANFIS approach has become one of the main areas of interest because it gains the benefits of neural networks (NN) as well as mysterious logic systems and eliminates individual defects by combining them with common features. The artificial neural network (ANN) has injected new momentum into the mysterious literature. ANN can be used as a universal learning model for any smooth parameter models, including the mysterious inference system. The mixed learning base used to combine the gradient ratios technique and the Least Square Estimator (LSE) to train the ANFIS network for a particular problem. This chapter introduces the design of the ANFIS for the 7 DOF manipulator model built by the VR environment and simulates this model by connecting Matlab Simulink with VR to execute commands produced by the system based ANFIS console. Satisfactory results are obtained in simulations which improve the design as a basic application of this control design.	2019	2019 12th International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE)	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

The problems addressed in this contribution are, first, that the interconnectedness of the world's countries calls for inter country governing structures, which are difficult to achieve on a large and world wide scale and, second, that global forces impede democracy within single countries. Starting from the premise that effectively addressing the second problem is necessary for making major progress in resolving the first, the contribution approaches this problem on the terrain of political culture. To this end, it draws on the theory of ""developmental democracy"" expounded by C.B. Macpherson to argue that citizens motivated by the counter possessive individualist values of developmental democracy are best placed to resist anti democratic pressures on their respective countries and are also prone to support trans country democratic initiatives and institutions."	2008		0.125	0.4650000035762787	1	-0.6940000057220459

The aim of the present systematic review was to clarify the effects of probiotics on BP using a meta analysis of randomized, controlled trials. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library (Central) Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and Clinicaltrial.gov databases were searched until January 2014 to identify eligible articles. Meta analysis using a random effects model was chosen to analyze the impact of combined trials. Nine trials were included. Probiotic consumption significantly changed systolic BP by 3.56 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 6.46 to 0.66) and diastolic BP by 2.38 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 2.38 to 0.93) compared with control groups. A greater reduction was found with multiple as compared with single species of probiotics, for both systolic and diastolic BP. Subgroup analysis of trials with baseline BP =130/85 mm Hg compared with <130/85 mm Hg found a more significant improvement in diastolic BP. Duration of intervention <8 weeks did not result in a significant reduction in systolic or diastolic BP. Furthermore, subgroup analysis of trials with daily dose of probiotics <1011 colony forming units did not result in a significant meta analysis effect. The present meta analysis suggests that consuming probiotics may improve BP by a modest degree, with a potentially greater effect when baseline BP is elevated, multiple species of probiotics are consumed, the duration of intervention is =8 weeks, or daily consumption dose is =1011 colony forming units.	2014	Hypertension	0.5	1.8600000143051147	4	0.03700000047683716

The absence of any reliable and practical physical device that can demonstrate the perceived behaviors of the memristor has been hindering the experimental work and the implementation of memristor based applications. Therefore, most of the research works are still at the analytical stage and depend on mathematical models or emulator circuits of the memristor. In this chapter, the fundamental concepts and the theoretical background of memristor are briefly illustrated to provide a background for the memristor models and emulator circuits to be presented in this book.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	2	-0.44999998807907104

This paper presents the design and development of a mobile application for promoting learners' experiences in learning the English vocabularies by formulating the compound words generated from images. The proposed system is based on the multi agent system (MAS) covering three main agents: matching learners agent, combination vocabulary agent, and feedback agent. The innovation of the proposed approach is that many learners (matching learners agent) can formulate the new vocabulary that is formed from the combination algorithm (combination vocabulary agent) and learners can experience new vocabulary represented by using the image results (feedback agent) The two experiments of the system performance evaluation are reported. The experimental results show that the performance of the vocabularies' detection and the sub processes execution were achieved the high accuracy.	2019	2019 16th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716

The author argues that the successful implementation of such systems requires a comprehensive approach involving the development or the adaptation of MAB philosophy taking into account the software functionality and related business processes. The author demonstrates that ERP software is the most effective technological platform for corporate MAB systems of project oriented companies. This is explained by the fact that the ERP systems have both sufficient functionality for project management automation and appropriate tools for management accounting and budgeting. Relying on this analysis, a comprehensive approach and appropriate solutions for developing corporate MAB systems in project oriented construction companies are proposed. The methodological solutions proposed in the field of MAB design take into account the specific nature of a contractor who carries out construction projects for external customers. In particular, the following methodological solutions are presented: establishing temporary project based profit centers in the construction company's financial structure; using administrative quasi projects and the ""direct costing"" method for fixed overheads costing in certain departments; establishing temporary profit centers related to production departments (internal subcontractors) This paper also shows how such a financial structure may be used in the SAP ERP system relying on the end to end ""project"" attribute. A budgeting structure with two versions of the corporate master budget is proposed. The first version of the structure is based on the contracting plans and the second on the last approved project budget versions. The paper shows that monitoring implementation is necessary for both master budget versions. The main assertions and results of the paper are applied in the implementation of a corporate MAB information system based on SAP ERP in a construction company. The results ofthe system's implementation and operation have shown significant improvement in the key financial indicators of the company, including _ profits, rate of return and net cash flow."	2016		0.625	2.325000047683716	1	-0.6940000057220459
102	158672825	158672825	Drivers, motivations, and barriers to the implementation of corporate social responsibility practices by construction enterprises: A review	Abstract Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has gained increasing attention in the construction industry. The implementation of CSR integrates the desires of construction enterprises to achieve competitive advantages and demonstrate their commitments to be socially responsible. Previous studies have mainly explored the factors influencing CSR implementation in a broader field of management, recognizing that there are discrete sets of influencing factors for different industry sectors. Based on a systematic review of 69 relevant CSR research in construction, this study aims to identify and conceptualize the influencing factors drivers, motivations, and barriers for CSR implementation by construction enterprises. The descriptive analysis shows an increasing trend in CSR studies in construction with studies focused on both developed and developing countries. The content analysis results show that the drivers can be categorized into three sub themes: policy pressure, market pressure, and innovation and technology development. The key motivations include: financial benefits, branding, reputation and image, relationship building, organizational culture, and strategic business direction. Next, the barriers were grouped into five perspectives, namely: government policy, construction enterprise, the attributes of CSR, the stakeholder perspective, and the construction industry. To conceptualize these influencing factors, this study proposed a theoretical perspective that combined the stakeholder, institutional and self determination theories. The findings have implications for government agencies in the development of relevant policies to encourage the adoption of CSR practices in the industry. For construction enterprises, the findings have implications to their new or existing CSR practices in enhancing organizational competitive advantages and in achieving their goals to be socially responsible.	2019	Journal of Cleaner Production	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

It includes two classical exact LB schemes, i.e. Bosch Karlin (BK) scheme and He Luo (HL) scheme, and the present Taylor expansion (TE) scheme. TE scheme originates from the extension of BK scheme. The mathematical mechanism and the equilibrium distribution evolution behind these exact schemes have been detailedly addressed. After that, an analysis is carried out to discuss the cause of the LB equation difference among the schemes, which offers an insight of the exactness in these schemes and brings up their continuity precondition. At last, the schemes are systematically addressed for their pros and cons in the further development of LB equations.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	3	-0.2070000022649765

(MO) root, possessing various pharmacological properties including anti osteoporosis, anti inflammation and anti rheumatism activities.The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the pharmacological actions of MO by investigating the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of IGs in MO.MethodsAn ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of MON and DA levels in plasma and various tissues of Wistar rats. MON, DA and acetaminophen (ACE) as the internal standard (IS) were extracted from rat plasma and tissue samples by direct deproteinization with methanol. The rats were administered orally at 1650 mg/kg MO and 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg MO iridoid glycosides (MOIGs) or intravenously at MOIG 25 mg/kg for pharmacokinetic study of MON and DA. In addition, 100 mg/kg MOIG was administered orally for tissue distribution study of MON and DA. Non compartmental pharmacokinetic profiles were constructed. Tissue distributions were calculated according to the validated methods.ResultsSignificant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in male and female rats. The AUC0 t, Cmax and bioavailability of MON and DA in female rats were higher than those in male rats. MON and DA mainly distributed in the intestine and stomach after oral administration, and noteworthily high concentrations of MON and DA were detected in the rat hypothalamus.ConclusionThe results of the present study may shed new lights on the biological behavior of MOIGs in vivo, help explain their pharmacological actions, and provide experimental clues for rational clinical use of these IGs extracted from the MO root.	2018	BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine	0.75	2.7899999618530273	13	2.2320001125335693

Metodologia: L'A. utilizza la matrice concettuale dell'Approccio Sistemico Vitale (ASV) per identificare principali caratteristiche, punti di forza e di debolezza degli Strumenti Finanziari. Il lavoro si basa sull'analisi empirica di diversi casi in Italia nel precedente periodo 2007 13, per arrivare a identificare elementi di criticita e possibili aree di miglioramento, in particolare nell'ambito dell'evoluzione dell'economia e pratica d'impresa legata ai concetti di strumento, tecnica e metodo. Risultati: Il lavoro fornisce un'analisi dei diversi Strumenti Finanziari e propone potenziali aree di miglioramento per una loro virtuosa implementazione nel periodo di Programmazione 2014 20. Limiti della ricerca: Ulteriori spunti e approfondimenti potrebbero riguardare eventuali limiti del processo negoziale a monte (a livello di Commissione Europea) e a valle (tra i diversi organismi coinvolti nel processo multilivello di implementazione) Ulteriori indagini potrebbero inoltre essere volte ad avvalorare, attraverso analisi empiriche, i meccanismi che possono costituire fattori limitanti dello sviluppo territoriale in ottica di coesione. Implicazioni pratiche: Se il territorio e un ""sistema vitale"" allora gli operatori (pubblici, privati, del mondo no profit, cittadini, intermediari finanziari, ecc. che vi operano, interagiscono tra loro come componenti sistemiche, sicche il programmatore non puo esimersi dall'evolvere metodi, tecniche e strumenti della Programmazione per rispondere sinergicamente alle istanze di diversi sovrasistemi. Per la loro natura revolving, integrata e partecipativa, gli Strumenti Finanziari a valere su fondi SIE risultano particolarmente idonei a sfruttare l'impianto concettuale e interpretativo della teoria sistemico vitale, come piattaforma di lancio verso modelli innovativi, che ottimizzino l'uso di tali fondi, massimizzando l'impatto per il territorio. Originalita del lavoro: Il paper si pone secondo un modus pensandi innovativo alla programmazione territoriale, che superi visioni struttura centriche, focalizzate sui finanziamenti a fondo perduto di singole iniziative, per adottare approcci di tipo sistemico, che implementino direttrici di sviluppo ""a raggio"" basate sulle relazioni e interrelazioni tra le componenti e i sovrasistemi rilevanti, mediante progetti integrati e strumenti di co creazione di valore. Secondo tale visione, i diversi attori del territorio collaborano, in una logica partenariale, allineando i propri percorsi evolutivi, in un meccanismo di progressivo appressamento a condizioni di consonanza di contesto, tali da garantire la sostenibilita e quindi la sopravvivenza nel lungo periodo del sistema: non soltanto il sistema impresa, sistema finanziario o sistema politico, ma il sistema quartiere, citta, area vasta, ossia il ""sistema territorio"" A tal fine, l'A. sostiene si renda necessaria una riflessione critica e un conseguente affinamento del metodo di approccio alle problematiche territoriali nell'ambito della Politica di Coesione."	2018		0.75	2.7899999618530273	1	-0.6940000057220459
106	53648654	53648654	Evaluating Embodied Navigation in Virtual Reality Environments	Virtual reality has become more accessible and affordable to the general public in recent years, introducing the exciting potential of this technology to new audiences. However, the mechanisms of navigating within a virtual environment have primarily been constrained to handheld input devices akin to gaming controllers. For people unfamiliar with traditional gaming input devices, VR navigation devices are not intuitively mapped to real world modes of locomotion and can be frustrating and disorienting. Designers have largely focused on utility (the ability to efficiently accomplish a task) to the detriment of usability (ease of use) The industry lacks an intuitive, universal method of navigation that can be easily learned by novice participants. Dr. Jakob Nielsen identified five factors that impact usability in human computer interactions (HCI) learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Previous research in virtual environment locomotion incorporated teaching time periods where the researchers explained the control devices to participants. We believe that this neglected one of the key usability factors in human computer interactions: learnability, or the ability and ease to accomplish a task the first time a user encounters it. Our research focuses on comparing existing modes of navigation (game controller based) with a mode of controller less fully embodied navigation between two demographics based on Nielsen's usability factors. Existing research has demonstrated little noticeable learnability difference between modes of rotation and lean based navigation, and joystick navigation in VR [1] however, similar study demonstrates that partially embodied leaning mechanics can positively affect sensory perception in VR [2] While previous Studies in controller less VR navigation methods have demonstrated an inclination toward subject motion sickness when controllers are removed [3] other research has yielded positive qualitative results (sans motion sickness) when partially embodied alternative controller systems are used [4] Additional research into partially embodied alternative controller systems has, in fact, indicated a preference toward existing modes of controller based joystick navigation in VR subjects [5] however, when partially embodied leaning mechanics are combined with another mode of sensory perception, like foot haptics, self motion perception (vection) is enhanced [6] In this study, we test a fully embodied mode of navigation to evaluate whether a fully engaged body experiences more positive usability results according to HCI measures. We test our results within communities of self identified gamers and non gamers, evaluating navigation modes designed for joystick control pads, trigger based teleportation, and controller less embodied navigation. Our research inquires whether embodied navigation enhances usability in accordance with Nielsen's usability factors, specifically enabling easier access and engagement for inexperienced subj e ct s, compared with controller based modes of navigation.	2018	2018 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM)	0.75	2.7899999618530273	5	0.2809999883174896
107	206957962	206957962	miR 125a and miR 34a expression predicts Richter syndrome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia. It is characterized by the accumulation of CD19+/CD5+ lymphocytes and can have variable outcomes. Richter syndrome (RS) is a lethal complication in CLL patients that results in aggressive B cell lymphomas, and there are no tests to predict its occurrence. Because alterations in microRNA expression can predict the development and progression of several cancers, we investigated whether dysregulation of specific microRNAs can predict RS in CLL patients. Thus, we compared microRNA expression levels in samples from 49 CLL patients who later developed RS with samples from 59 CLL patients who did not. We found that high expression of miR 125a 5p or low expression of miR 34a 5p can predict ~50% of RS with a false positive rate of ~9% We found that CLL patients predicted to develop RS show either an increase of miR 125a 5p expression ~20 fold) or a decrease of miR 34a 5p expression ~21 fold) compared with CLL patients that are not predicted to develop RS. Thus, miR 125a 5p and miR 34a 5p can be valuable predictor markers of RS and have the potential to provide physicians with information that can indicate the best therapeutic strategy for CLL patients.	2018	Blood	0.75	2.7899999618530273	10	1.5

The two month old fish were fed fish meal SBM based diets with replacement by FPKM at 25% (25FPKM) 50% (50FPKM) 75% (75FPKM) and 100% (100FPKM) for 12 weeks, while an FPKM free diet (0FPKM) was used as a control. Based on growth performance, feed utilization, digestive enzyme activities, flesh quality, carcass composition, hematological parameters and liver histoarchitecture, the 50% replacement level of SBM by FPKM support this alternative. Findings from the current study support the use of FPKM in aquafeed production, providing a low cost diet for tilapia farming. Abstract The solid state fermentation by effective microorganisms (containing photosynthetic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, nitrogen fixing bacteria, yeast and Bacillus sp. improved the nutritive values of palm kernel meal (PKM) Increased crude protein (20.79% nitrogen free extract (40.07% and gross energy (19.58% were observed in fermented PKM (FPKM) relative to raw PKM while crude lipid (15.65% crude fiber (36.45% and ash (29.54% were decreased. Replacement of soybean meal (SBM) with FPKM as a protein source was investigated for its effects in sex reversed red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus x O. mossambicus) The two month old fish (14.85 0.28 g initial weight) were fed fish meal SBM based diets with replacement by FPKM at 25% (25FPKM) 50% (50FPKM) 75% (75FPKM) and 100% (100FPKM) while an FPKM free diet (0FPKM) was used as a control. The five treatments, comprising triplicate cement ponds and forty fish each, were conducted in a recirculating system over 12 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, fish fed the 50FPKM diet were superior in growth performance, while the feed utilization parameters were similar across all five treatments. Physiological adaptation of the protein digesting (pepsin and trypsin) and lipid digesting (lipase) enzymes was detected at all protein replacement levels (except for 25FPKM) as well as of the enzyme for cellulose digestion (cellulase) but not of the carbohydrate digesting enzymes (amylase) Protein synthesis capacity in flesh was improved in fish fed the 50FPKM diet, while the quality of the main flesh proteins, actin and myosin, showed no significant differences across the five treatments. No differences in carcass composition and no negative effects on hematological parameters or liver histoarchitecture at the 50% replacement level of SBM by FPKM also support this alternative. Findings from the current study indicate the low cost FPKM containing diet for tilapia in comparison with control diet.	2021	Animals an open access journal from MDPI	0.9380000233650208	3.4893600940704346	4	0.03700000047683716

The complex nature of this chemical diversity has previously been probed via directed analyses of a small number of compounds, identified through targeted assays rather than more comprehensive biochemical profiling approaches such as metabolomics. Insights into ecological and evolutionary relationships within bacterial genera can be derived through comparative analysis of broader secondary metabolite patterns, and this can also eventually assist biodiscovery search strategies for new natural products. Here, we investigated the species level chemical diversity of the two marine actinobacterial species Salinispora arenicola and Salinispora pacifica, isolated from sponges distributed across the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) via their secondary metabolite profiles using LC MS based metabolomics. The chemical profiles of these two species were obtained by UHPLC QToF MS based metabolic profiling. The resultant data were interrogated using multivariate data analysis methods to compare their (bio)chemical profiles. We found a high level of inter species diversity in strains from these two bacterial species. We also found rifamycins and saliniketals were produced exclusively by S. arenicola species, as the main secondary metabolites differentiating the two species. Furthermore, the discovery of 57 candidate compounds greatly increases the small number of secondary metabolites previously known to be produced by these species. In addition, we report the production of rifamycin O and W, a key group of ansamycin compounds, in S. arenicola for the first time. Species of the marine actinobacteria harbour a much wider spectrum of secondary metabolites than suspected, and this knowledge may prove a rich field for biodiscovery as well as a database for understanding relationships between speciation, evolution and chemical ecology.	2014	PloS one	0.5	1.8600000143051147	7	0.7689999938011169

These properties of social networks which are known as 5'Vs of big data has led to many unique and enlightenment algorithms and techniques applied to large social networking datasets and data streams. Many of these researches are based on detection and tracking of hot topics and trending social media events that help revealing many unanswered questions. These algorithms and in some cases software products mostly rely on the nature of the language itself. Although, other techniques such as unsupervised data mining methods are language independent but many requirements for a comprehensive solution are not met. Many research issues such as noisy sentences that adverse grammar and new online user invented words are challenging maintenance of a good social network topic detection and tracking methodology; The semantic relationship between words and in most cases, synonyms are also ignored by many of these researches. In this research, we use Transformers combined with an incremental community detection algorithm. Transformer in one hand, provides the semantic relation between words in different contexts. On the other hand, the proposed graph mining technique enhances the resulting topics with aid of simple structural rules. Named entity recognition from multimodal data, image and text, labels the named entities with entity type and the extracted topics are tuned using them. All operations of proposed system has been applied with big social data perspective under NoSQL technologies. In order to present a working and systematic solution, we combined MongoDB with Neo4j as two major database systems of our work. The proposed system shows higher precision and recall compared to other methods in three different datasets.	2020	ArXiv	0.875	3.255000114440918	5	0.2809999883174896

Models of WM suggest that these demands are coordinated by a gate between perceptual input and WM. Previous work with a letter updating paradigm (Kessler Oberauer, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 40, 738 754, 2014) supported a scanning and gate switching (SGS) model of WM updating. The present work provides further evidence for the SGS model. Participants were required to keep track of the last letter that appeared in each of a row of frames on the screen. On each updating step, a variable subset of letters in varying positions in the row had to be updated. The SGS model assumes that on each updating step, participants scan through the memory set sequentially, opening the gate when a letter requires updating, and closing the gate when the next letter needs to be maintained. As is predicted by the SGS model, the reaction times for each updating step increased with the number of updated items and with the number of gate switches. In addition, the present experiment provides direct evidence supporting the scanning assumption of the model. Hebrew speaking participants performed the task with either Hebrew or English letter stimuli, in different blocks. As was predicted, the scanning direction of the stimulus set was from left to right in English and from right to left in Hebrew. The SGS model fit the data only when the scanning direction was taken into account, establishing the role of item based forward scanning during WM updating.	2015	Psychonomic bulletin review	0.5619999766349792	2.090640068054199	2	-0.44999998807907104

Satellite borne microwave stratospheric temperature measurements up to 1 mb, from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A (AMSU A) the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and the Special Sensor microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S) were assimilated into the WRF model over the continental U.S. during winter and summer 2015 using the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system. Adjusted stratospheric temperature related to upper stratospheric ozone absorption of short wave (SW) radiation further lead to vibration in downward SW radiation in winter predictions and overall reduced with a maximum of 5.5% reduction of downward SW radiation in summer predictions. Stratospheric signals in winter need 48 to 72 h to propagate to the lower troposphere while near instant tropospheric response to the stratospheric initial conditions are observed in summer predictions. A schematic plot illustrated the physical processes of the coupled stratosphere and troposphere related to radiative processes. Our results suggest that the inclusion of the entire stratosphere and better representation of the upper stratosphere are important in regional NWP systems in short term forecasts.	2019	Climate	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716

Especially for maritime industry, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) launched new noise regulation since July 2014, which demands a maximum acceptable sound pressure level of 110 dB at any individual measurement position in the machinery space. Wartsila has a decade of experience on large medium speed diesel engine noise and vibration research and development. Today's Wartsila is capable to technically reduce the engine noise level by 5 dB without any insulation panel even with increased engine power and higher fuel efficiency. This paper will explain in detail both the structure borne noise and air borne noise from an engine, from the source of excitation, transmission path and the structure noise radiation. Major noisy engine components that contributes the engine room noise level will be addressed, from both theoretical and experimental point of view. This paper will also explain the methodology of noise reduction on different engine noise sources. In the end, other important factors that matter with final engine room noise level will be pointed out. Introduction Wartsila is a global leader in advanced technologies and complete lifecycle solutions for the marine and energy markets. One of its major products is large medium speed engines for shipyards and power plants. The engines being mentioned in this paper refer to W32 type, which has cylinder bore of 32 cm in diameter. Depending on different cylinder configurations ranging from 6 to 20, the weight of W32 in line engines ranges 30 50 tons and V engines ranges 50 90 tons. At full load the engine output is 580 kW per cylinder and nominal speed is 720 or 750 rpm. At operating conditions, such massive machinery can produce significant amount of noise that may easily damage hearing within seconds if no hearing protection is used. The main driving force for research of engine noise reduction is from relevant regulations. For the power plants there are various local occupational health and safety related and environment related regulations. For maritime industry the regulations are mainly from IMO (International Maritime Organization) With the increasing awareness of safety and comfort, the importance of noise has increased dramatically in the past 20 years. In July 2014, IMO has adopted regulation II 1/3 12 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974 as amended, concerning protection against noise. The new regulation has become mandatory and it requires a maximum of 110 dB at every individual measurement location 1 m away from the engine surface. This new regulation is much stricter comparing to the old one and it may pose great challenges to shipyards. Wartsila started research work in engine noise and vibration since 1990s. The manpower in the engine acoustics has increased from one to nowadays seven [1] The noise research area covers not only engine noise itself, but also exhaust noise, environmental noise and personnel daily noise exposure. Latest relevant papers can be found [2 5] The pace of development of engine noise reduction solutions has speeded up in the past decade, with great amount of research projects in cooperation with various institutes, mainly in Scandinavian countries. Today's Wartsila is capable of reduce engine noise by more than 5 dB without any insulation panels, even though the engine output has increased by 16% This has made Wartsila extremely competitive in the market where nowadays customers intend to select a manufacture with quieter engines. Meanwhile, shipyards are expected to take the leading role and responsibility of engine room acoustical design which will significantly influence the resulted engine room noise level. 2 Aachen Acoustics Colloquium 2016 Measurement Techniques The SOLAS regulation on machinery room noise requires maximum 110 dB as sound pressure level, which will not only depend on the engine sound power but also the on site room acoustical properties. As engine manufacture, Wartsila is responsible for the engine sound power, which is a unique property of the product. In order to deliver reliable data, the instruments used in Wartisla for standardized sound power reporting meet the requirements of the IEC 1043 and the measurement procedure is based on ISO 9614 ""Acoustics Determination of sound power levels of noise sources using sound intensity"" Part 2 ""Measurement by scanning"" Concerning the measurement uncertainty and accuracy, the ""Engineering grade"" (grade 2) defined in ISO 9614 Part 2 is used. The method of measuring the component of sound intensity normal to a measurement surface which is chosen so as to enclose the engine of which the sound power level is to be determined is specified in house. Surface integration of the intensity component normal to the measurement surface is approximated by subdividing the measurement surface into contiguous segments, and scanning the intensity probe over each segment along a continuous path which covers the extent of the segment. To standardise sound intensity measurement, the engine to be measured is divided into partial sources. Moreover, in most cases the measurements are on purpose of research aiming at localizing the sound sources of an engine, a partial source should be in turn divided into even smaller measurement segments which can completely encloses the engine, Figure 1. Figure 1: Left, partial sources division on a Wartsila V engine; Right, example of detail measurement segments for sound intensity scanning for a Wartsila in line engine. With increasing knowledge gained through standard sound intensity measurements, there have been more and more need for sound source localization for engine product in Wartsila. Scan and paint (S&P) technology has drawn Wartsila's attention for this purpose. Comparing to traditional sound intensity probe which consists of two microphones, the S&P probe consists of one microphone and one velocity sensor, Figure 2. Figure 2: Left, example of traditional sound intensity probe composed by two microphones; Right, example of S&P probe composed by one microphone and one particle velocity sensor. Aachen Acoustics Colloquium 2016 3 The S&P probe is supposed to be used at near field for sound source localization, and at further distance for sound intensity identification. As a relatively new technology in the market, the device was assessed by Wartsila in cooperation with VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland) in 2015. Measurements were carried out on the top part of a Wartsila in line engine by both the traditional probe and S&P probe. The results are demonstrated in Figure 3. Figure 3: Left, particle velocity level of engine top part at a certain frequency band; Right, A weighted sound power levels comparison between results from traditional and S&P probe. It is found out that this new technology of measuring sound intensity by a probe consisting of one microphone and one velocity sensor is feasible to be used for noise localization and sound intensity measurement on large heavy duty medium speed engines at Wartsila. Engine Mechanical Noise Engine noise is complex in the way that there are multiple excitation mechanisms generate noise and vibration energy that transfers through all engine components giving rise to both structureborne and airborne noise. The typical noise spectrum of a medium speed engine is similar to white noise, i.e. energy distributed in broadband, Figure 4. Figure 4: A weighted sound power level of a certain type of Wartsila diesel engines. 90% of the measured engines have noise level within the grey area. As can be seen from Figure 4, the dominating frequency range is about 500 2k Hz. In this frequency range most of the noise is caused by engine mechanical excitations. From experience, com4 Aachen Acoustics Colloquium 2016 bustion noise is not so important for a large diesel engine because it has relatively low frequency ranges, i.e. below 500Hz, and especially when the engine runs on full load other noise sources will dominate. At higher frequencies above 3k Hz, typically there is turbocharger tonal noise, which can reach over 130 dB at 1 m distance if no silencer is applied. Typically, a diesel engine is noisier than a gas engine. Figure 5 shows an example of a Wartsila dual fuel gen set noise levels on diesel and gas modes. Figure 5: A weighted sound power levels of a certain type of Wartsila dual fuel gen set running on diesel and gas modes. The total noise level of diesel mode is about 4 dB higher than gas mode. The main difference exists in the mechanical noise frequency range, i.e. 500 2k Hz. This is due to the fuel injection process of the diesel mode. When the cam drives the fuel injection pump, high torsional vibration will be generated on the camshaft. This torsional vibration will cause gear teeth impact in the gear train. The energy generated by gear teeth impact will transfer via shaft bearings to engine block and attached structures, thus radiates noise. This phenomenon has been investigated earlier at Wartsila in cooperation with KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) and Lloyd's Register ODS [6] To illustrate the gear teeth impact, the shaft torques were measured and demonstrated in Figure 6. Figure 6: Camshaft and intermediate shaft torques measured on a Wartsila in line engine with 6 cylinders. Red intermediate shaft; Blue camshaft. Aachen Acoustics Colloquium 2016 5 Yellow ovals mark the fuel injection moment for each cylinder. One may also notice that there are sharp negative peaks in the torque measurement results. These peaks marked by blue and red ovals indicate that the gear teeth of the mesh between camshaft and intermediate shaft have traveled through its backlash and are impacting with each other on the non working flank. Before and after gear impacts a loss of contact between the teeth occurs, marked by black ovals. The gear impacts are more"	2016		0.625	2.325000047683716	2	-0.44999998807907104

Similar to the difference coarray perspective, we first construct a virtual space time snapshot from the direct covariance matrix of the received signals. Then, a new CNCM estimation corresponding to the virtual space time snapshot can be computed by the spatial temporal smoothing technique for STAP filter. Furthermore, the comparative simulations and analyses with the traditional uniform STAP and the recently reported coprime STAP are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the O2LN STAP approach.	2019	Mathematical Problems in Engineering	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	3	-0.2070000022649765

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading pathogen in surgical site, intensive care unit, and skin infections, as well as healthcare associated pneumonias. These infections are associated with an enormous burden of morbidity, mortality, and increase of hospital length of stay and patient cost. S. aureus is impressively fast in acquiring antibiotic resistance, and multidrug resistant strains are a serious threat to human health. Due to resistance or insufficient effectiveness, antibiotics and bundle measures leave a tremendous unmet medical need worldwide. There are no licensed vaccines on the market despite the significant efforts done by public and private initiatives. Indeed, vaccines tested in clinical trials in the last two decades have failed to show efficacy. However, they targeted single antigens and contained no adjuvants and efficacy trials were performed in severely ill subjects. Herein, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of potential target populations for efficacy trials taking into account key factors such as population size, incidence of S. aureus infection, disease outcome, primary endpoints, as well as practical advantages and disadvantages. We describe the whole blood assay as a potential surrogate of protection, and we show the link between phase III clinical trial data of failed vaccines with their preclinical observations. Finally, we give our perspective on how new vaccine formulations and clinical development approaches may lead to successful S. aureus vaccines.	2017	Current topics in microbiology and immunology	0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	6	0.5249999761581421

However, the knowledge about the impact on compressor performance of a diffuser vane clearance between vane and diffuser wall which is mandatory since the diffuser geometry adjustment has to take place during operation, is still not satisfying.This two part paper summarizes results of investigations performed at the Institute of Jet Propulsion and Turbomachinery at RWTH Aachen with an industrial like centrifugal compressor, featuring a design pressure ratio of 4 and a design speed of 35200 rpm. Particular attention was directed to the influence of the diffuser clearance on the operating behavior of the entire stage, the pressure recovery in the diffuser and on the diffuser flow by a systematic variation of the parameters diffuser clearance height, diffuser vane angle, radial gap between impeller exit and diffuser inlet, and rotor speed.Compressor map measurements provide a summary of the operating behavior related to diffuser geometry and impeller speed, whereas detailed flow measurements with temperature and pressure probes allow a breakdown of the losses between impeller and diffuser and contribute to a better understanding of relevant flow phenomena. The results presented in Part I show that an one sided diffuser clearance does not necessarily has a negative impact on the operation and loss behavior of the centrifugal compressor, but instead may contribute to an increased pressure ratio and improved efficiency.The flow phenomena responsible for this detected performance behavior are exposed in Part II [28] where the results of detailed measurements with pressure probes at diffuser exit and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements conducted inside the diffuser channel, revealing the complex and unsteady flow leaving the impeller and passing the diffuser channel, are discussed.The experimental results are published as an open CFD testcase ""Radiver 2"" [26] extending the experimental data base of the testcase ""Radiver"" published in 2003 by Ziegler [31].Copyright (c) 2014 by ASME"	2014		0.5	1.8600000143051147	2	-0.44999998807907104

Several intermediate metabolites like pentachlorocyclohexenes, tetrachlorocyclohexenes, trichlorocyclohexane, dichlorocyclohexane, aliphatic chlorinated compounds, phenols were detected using GC MS. It was observed that after 120 h, lindane was efficiently degraded after treatment with bacteria algal culture. To assess the detoxification extent in different modes of lindane degradation, methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay for cytotoxicity and 7 ethoxyresorufin O deethylase (EROD) assay for xenobiotics were determined using human hepato carcinoma cell line HepG2. After 168 h treatment by bacto algal co culture, LC50 was increased by 1.89 folds and 3.1 fold decrease in EROD induction confirmed the reduction in toxicity. Integrated toxico chemical analysis clearly indicated that the artificial bacterial and algal consortia could be considered as a prospective approach for degradation and detoxification of environments contaminated with lindane and other organochlorinated pesticides.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716
121	218518802	218518802	An intensive form of trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy in an acute adolescent inpatient unit: An uncontrolled open trial	Purpose: Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates among hospitalised adolescents are between 21% and 32% and there is a lack of evidence based interventions for this population. Trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy (TF CBT) is an evidence based intervention for children and adolescents with PTSD; however, it has not been implemented in an acute adolescent inpatient unit. This study examines the implementation of an intensive form of TF CBT in an adolescent inpatient unit. Method: An uncontrolled open trail study was conducted where 15 adolescents diagnosed with PTSD were treated with an intensive form of TF CBT. Measures used were the University of California, Los Angeles' (UCLA) PTSD Reaction Index for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. Adolescent Version; DSM IV Adolescent Version) the National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) Results: Adolescents received an average of nine sessions of TF CBT over a period of 28 days. The average NSESSS on admission was 23.73 and 8.27 at discharge; the CGAS average on admission was 19 and on discharge was 48.7; both were statistically significant changes. Conclusion: Preliminary findings support the use of an intensive form of TF CBT to treat adolescents with PTSD admitted to acute adolescent inpatient units indicating the need for further research in this area.	2020	Clinical child psychology and psychiatry	0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716

Here we provide a national scale analysis of SARS CoV 2 outbreaks in Austria, a country that played a major role for virus transmission across Europe and beyond. Capitalizing on a national epidemiological surveillance system, we performed deep whole genome sequencing of virus isolates from 576 samples to cover major Austrian SARS CoV 2 clusters. Our data chart a map of early viral spreading in Europe, including the path from low frequency mutations to fixation. Detailed epidemiological surveys enabled us to calculate the effective SARS CoV 2 population bottlenecks during transmission and unveil time resolved intra patient viral quasispecies dynamics. This study demonstrates the power of integrating deep viral genome sequencing and epidemiological data to better understand how SARS CoV 2 spreads through populations.

In addition, this study explores the effect of these tutorials on academic performance. Understanding the perceptions of students regarding the effectiveness of using web conferencing is both influential and critical to the success or failure of the integration of web conferencing in accounting education. In general, attendance of web conference based tutorials was found to positively and statistically significantly impact the students' academic performance, and the majority of the respondents agreed that regularly attending the web conferences and connecting with instructors improve their academic performance. These findings offer support for the continued use of web conferencing as a beneficial teaching and learning intervention. While this study is limited to a single site, the positive results of this study may encourage other instructors to explore web conferencing tutorials and enable subsequent multiple site investigations.	2018		0.75	2.7899999618530273	3	-0.2070000022649765

Controllable synthesis of large size single crystal h BN is highly desirable but challenging. A great deal of h BN synthesis is carried out on various transition metal substrates, such as Cu,[1,2,14] Co,[15,16] Ni,[17,18] and Fe,[19 21] thanks to their catalytic activities favorable for the nucleation and growth of high quality h BN. Nevertheless, rational engineering of catalytic effects of a given transition metal substrate by alloying or incorporating dissimilar species has been rarely studied for the h BN growth in order to enhance the control of layer number, nucleation density, and domain size; the only available efforts to date are Si doping or N doping of Fe substrates,[19,21] oxygen passivation of Cu substrates,[22] and carbon incorporation of Co/Ni substrates.[10] While majority of the h BN synthesis effort have been performed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is versatile in terms of its ability to precisely control solid, gas, and plasma sources and tune the growth parameters. MBE has already been used to grow 2D h BN and h BN/graphene heterostructures.[10,23 29] In this work, we report the synthesis of millimeter size single crystal h BN domains through an interstitial carbon assisted approach in an MBE system. While the interstitial carbon assisted growth of h BN has been proposed in our recent effort,[10] leading to a large single crystal h BN flake of 600 700 mm, it is essential to achieve even larger single crystal h BN flakes with edge lengths on the order of millimeters or even continuous waferscale single crystal 2D films. In addition, the growth thermodynamics and kinetics in terms of temperature dependent growth and substrate surface engineering have not been comprehensively studied; numerical simulations are necessary to further elucidate the effect of the carbon incorporation on the The outstanding physical properties of 2D materials have sparked continuous research interest in exploiting these materials for next generation highperformance electronic and photonic technology. Scalable synthesis of highquality large area 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h BN) is a crucial step toward the ultimate success of many of these applications. In this work, a synthetic approach in which secondary recrystallized Ni (100) substrates underwent a carburization process, followed by the growth of h BN in a molecular beam epitaxy system is designed. The h BN growth dynamics is studied by tuning different growth parameters including the substrate temperature, and the boron and nitrogen source flux ratio. With assistance from density functional theory calculations, the role of interstitial C atoms in promoting h BN growth by enhancing the catalytic effect of the transition metal, which lowers the nucleation activation energy barrier, is rationalized. Through the control of the growth parameters, a single crystal h BN monolayer domain as large as 1.4 mm in edge length is achieved. In addition, a high quality, continuous, large area h BN single layer film with a breakdown electric field of 9.75 MV cm 1 is demonstrated. The high value of the breakdown electric field suggests that single layer h BN has extraordinary dielectric strength for high performance 2D electronics applications.	2019	Advanced Materials Interfaces	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	8	1.0130000114440918

Two SST data sets with data periods of approximately 51 years and longer than 100 years, respectively, were obtained from the National Institute of Fisheries Science and Japan Meteorological Agency. SST of Korean waters clearly increased during last 51 years (1968 2018) which was 2.5 times higher than the global trend. This significant increasing trend was caused by the dominant increasing SST trend during winter. However, a negative and positive SST anomaly frequently appeared during winter and summer, respectively, in a recent decade. These features of seasonal SST variation have changed the annual amplitude of SST, and resulted in a drastically increasing trend after 2009. Using the longer SST data set, it was revealed that the decreasing SST trend in winter began in the 2000s and the increasing SST trend in summer bagan in the 1990s. During a recent decade, there was a distinctive SST increase in summer, whereas a clear decrease in winter. In summary, the annual amplitude of SST around the Korean Peninsula significantly changed from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend during a recent decade.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	2	-0.44999998807907104
127	73462876	73462876	The HMGB1/RAGE axis triggers neutrophil mediated injury amplification following necrosis.	In contrast to microbially triggered inflammation, mechanisms promoting sterile inflammation remain poorly understood. Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are considered key inducers of sterile inflammation following cell death, but the relative contribution of specific DAMPs, including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is ill defined. Due to the postnatal lethality of Hmgb1 knockout mice, the role of HMGB1 in sterile inflammation and disease processes in vivo remains controversial. Here, using conditional ablation strategies, we have demonstrated that epithelial, but not bone marrow derived, HMGB1 is required for sterile inflammation following injury. Epithelial HMGB1, through its receptor RAGE, triggered recruitment of neutrophils, but not macrophages, toward necrosis. In clinically relevant models of necrosis, HMGB1/RAGE induced neutrophil recruitment mediated subsequent amplification of injury, depending on the presence of neutrophil elastase. Notably, hepatocyte specific HMGB1 ablation resulted in 100% survival following lethal acetaminophen intoxication. In contrast to necrosis, HMGB1 ablation did not alter inflammation or mortality in response to TNFor FAS mediated apoptosis.

128	753512	753512	Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories	Recently dense trajectories were shown to be an efficient video representation for action recognition and achieved state of the art results on a variety of datasets. This paper improves their performance by taking into account camera motion to correct them. To estimate camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be complementary. These matches are, then, used to robustly estimate a homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in general different from camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve the estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given the estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it. We also use this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This significantly improves motion based descriptors, such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results on four challenging action datasets (i.e. Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50) significantly outperform the current state of the art.	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision	0.43799999356269836	1.6293599605560303	2	-0.44999998807907104

As a result, the Department of Education urges teachers to develop instructional materials. This study was conducted at Bulusan National High School, Bulusan, Sorsogon, Philippines SY 2018 2019 which was aimed to develop gamified instructional materials in genetics that would aid in teaching and learning process of grade 12 STEM students. The developed gamified materials were collectively called the GIM in Genetics which is comprised of two parts; namely, Student's Portfolio and Gamified Lesson Plans. The GIM was anchored on the Teacher's Guide provided by DepEd. Further, it utilized different game elements, to wit: game mechanics, badges, power cards, scoring system, levels, and leaderboards to deliver innovative teaching strategy and quality education. This paper suggests the development of various innovative teaching strategies and instructional materials as well as its utilization across different fields and subject areas.	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	2	-0.44999998807907104

Aims: We investigated the links between small scale topographic complexity and resultant microclimatic heterogeneity, vascular plant species richness and beta diversity, and realised niche width and trait variation of some target species. Methods: We recorded temperature and soil moisture within 10 sites (40 m x 40 m) of differing topographic complexity in alpine terrain at Finse, Norway (N 60deg 36' E 7deg 33' Plant species occurrence and traits of target species were recorded in 16 sample plots at each site. Results: Sites differed significantly in microclimatic heterogeneity, and topographically rough sites were always more heterogeneous than flatter ones. Greater species richness and turnover was associated with greater microclimatic heterogeneity, and rough sites contained 15 55% more species than flatter ones. Plant species had on average wider realised niches when growing at rough sites. Individuals of Bistorta vivipara, but not those of Luzula spicata, tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation at rough sites. Conclusions: Rough alpine terrains create small scale variation in microclimate, promoting species richness and beta diversity. In the event of climate change, small scale microclimatic heterogeneity might allow plant species to escape from regional climate change by short distance migration to local micro refugia. This study suggests that the opportunity for such responses would be greater in topographically complex terrains.	2015		0.5619999766349792	2.090640068054199	3	-0.2070000022649765

133	119194249	119194249	Quantum process capability	Physical processes in the quantum regime possess non classical properties of quantum mechanics. However, methods for quantitatively identifying such processes are still lacking. Accordingly, in this study, we develop a framework for characterizing and quantifying the ability of processes to cause quantum mechanical effects on physical systems. We start by introducing a new concept, referred to as quantum process capability, to evaluate the effects of an experimental process upon a prescribed quantum specification. Various methods are then introduced for measuring such a capability. It is shown that the methods are adapted to quantum process tomography for implementation of process capability measure and applicable to all physical processes that can be described using the general theory of quantum operations. The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several examples, including processes of entanglement, coherence, and superposition. The formalism proposed in this study provides a generic approach for the identification of dynamical processes in quantum mechanics and facilitates the general classification of quantum information processing.	2019	Scientific Reports	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	6	0.5249999761581421
134	115455409	115455409	Application of artificial neural networks for optimized AHU discharge air temperature set point and minimized cooling energy in VAV system	Abstract Chillers and boilers based air handling unit (AHU) system is one of the most widely used heating and cooling systems in office buildings in Korea. However, in most conventional forced air systems, the guidelines for the AHU discharge air temperature (DAT) are not fully established and thus AHU DAT are constantly fixed to a particular set point, regardless of dynamic changes of operating variables. In this circumstance, this study aimed at developing a control algorithm that can operate a conventional VAV system with optimal set points for the AHU DAT. Three story office building was modeled using co simulation technique between EnergyPlus and Matlab via BCVTB (Building Controls Virtual Test Bed) In addition, artificial neural network (ANN) model, which was designed to predict the cooling energy consumption for the upcoming next time step, was embedded into the control algorithm using neural network toolbox within Matlab. By comparing the predicted energy for the different set points of the AHU DAT, the control algorithm can determine the most energy effective AHU DAT set point to minimize the cooling energy. The results showed that the prediction accuracy between simulated and predicted outcomes turned out to have a low coefficient of variation root mean square error (CvRMSE) value of approximately 24% In addition, the predictive control algorithm was able to significantly reduce cooling energy consumption by approximately 10% compared to a conventional control strategy of fixing AHU DAT to 14 degC. These findings suggest that the ANN model and the control algorithm showed energy saving potential for various types of forced air systems by taking dynamic operating conditions into account in each time step.	2019	Applied Thermal Engineering	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716
135	218554668	218554668	Commercial integrated crop livestock systems achieve comparable crop yields to specialized production systems: A meta analysis	"Production systems that feature temporal and spatial integration of crop and livestock enterprises, also known as integrated crop livestock systems (ICLS) have the potential to intensify production on cultivated lands and foster resilience to the effects of climate change without proportional increases in environmental impacts. Yet, crop production outcomes following livestock grazing across environments and management scenarios remain uncertain and a potential barrier to adoption, as producers worry about the effects of livestock activity on the agronomic quality of their land. To determine likely production outcomes across ICLS and to identify the most important moderating variables governing those outcomes, we performed a meta analysis of 66 studies comparing crop yields in ICLS to yields in unintegrated controls across 3 continents, 12 crops, and 4 livestock species. We found that annual cash crops in ICLS averaged similar yields 7% to +2% to crops in comparable unintegrated systems. The exception was dual purpose crops (crops managed simultaneously for grazing and grain production) which yielded 20% less on average than single purpose crops in the studies examined. When dual purpose cropping systems were excluded from the analysis, crops in ICLS yielded more than in unintegrated systems in loamy soils and achieved equal yields in most other settings, suggesting that areas of intermediate soil texture may represent a ""sweet spot"" for ICLS implementation. This meta analysis represents the first quantitative synthesis of the crop production outcomes of ICLS and demonstrates the need for further investigation into the conditions and management scenarios under which ICLS can be successfully implemented."	2020	PloS one	0.875	3.255000114440918	3	-0.2070000022649765

Design, Construction and Thermal Evaluation	Solar energy for cooking is an interesting option to achieve energy efficient cooking, while reducing environmental impact and facilitating nutritious cooking on a daily basis, especially to provide nutrition for young children. Solar oven delivers high thermal performance running on solar energy alone on clear days. On cloudy days, the amount of solar energy is not enough to use the solar oven. Therefore, it is necessary to cook with electricity, gas or firewood, which breaks the continuity of the use of the solar oven. Then, when it is possible to use the solar oven again (on the subsequent clear day) it is difficult because of the habit established of fuel use. The hybrid oven (solar biomass) allows for cooking every day of the year (clear or cloudy) with the same device, even at night. This paper presents the design, construction and thermal evaluation of a hybrid solar oven with biomass as an auxiliary source of energy. The basis is the drum solar oven, widely used for its characteristics: easy to build, efficient performance and optimum cooking capacity. It incorporates a specially designed appliance which takes advantage of the biomass and generates energy efficient cooking. Thermal tests are carried out to determine the characteristic parameters: figures of Merit F1 =0.100; F2 =0.253, standardized cooking power for 50degC, 31.2 W, and cooking efficiency 23.3% for operation only with solar energy and standardized cooking power for 50degC, 378.3W and cooking efficiency 5.8% for the oven with hybrid operation. Temperatures reached by the absorber plate are 120degC for solar only energy operation and 173degC for hybrid operation. These temperatures do not endanger the integrity of the materials used. Only a minimum amount of energy is needed to reach the necessary temperature and power for cooking. It is therefore an interesting and economical solution for all communities of any climatic condition, especially those that are isolated from energy supply networks.	2019		0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716

Afin d'ameliorer le diagnostic sur les urines, VitaDX a developpe dans le cadre de l'essai clinique VISIOCYT un dispositif medical qui utilise des algorithmes de traitement d'image et de machine learning (IA) pour predire le caractere tumoral des CUM. Methodes VISIOCYT est une etude clinique prospective multicentrique, portant sur 1360 patients repartis en deux groupes les temoins negatifs (TNeg) confirmes par une CUM et une endoscopie negatives et les patients porteur d'une tumeur urotheliale (PTU) par le resultat d'une histologie positive de carcinome urothelial. Les resultats de cette communication portent sur 586 patients 127 TNeg et 459 PTU (242 haut grade et 217 bas grade) Les performances ont ete evaluees par validation croisee, une approche statistique standard en IA. Les 586 patients ont donc ete subdivises aleatoirement 42 fois dans les proportions suivantes 5/6 des donnees pour l'apprentissage et 1/6 pour l'evaluation. Resultats A l'issue de la validation croisee, les mesures de performance obtenues sur chacune des 42 partitions sont moyennees pour evaluer les performances de l'algorithme. La sensibilite moyenne de l'algorithme est de 82,6 pour une specificite de 71,4 En detail, on observe une sensibilite moyenne de 89,3 pour les diagnostics de haut grades et de 76,4 pour les diagnostics de bas grade. Sur les memes partitions, a titre de comparaison, la sensibilite moyenne des praticiens de l'essai clinique est de 43 sur l'ensemble des malades, avec en particulier une sensibilite de 61,1 pour les haut grades et de 26,3 pour les bas grades. La specificite des praticiens est par defaut de 100 car la cytologie negative est un critere d'inclusion pour le groupe temoin Tableau 1 Conclusion L'approche algorithmique (IA) semble permettre un meilleur diagnostic des lesions urotheliales de bas grade par rapport a la CUM traditionnelle.

The research questions concerned the differential effects of e learning featuring contrastive video cases, role play including video feedback and their combination. The training effects were tested to determine whether they were similar across both professional domains. In a randomised controlled trial (N 168) three training conditions were prepared using a wait list control group. The assessment of communication competence was based on videotaped communications between the participants and simulated patients/parents (i.e. trained actors) The results of planned contrast analyses corroborated the study expectations: first, a strong overall treatment effect was observed. Second, the combined condition was more effective than e learning and role play alone when controlling for prior knowledge and cognitive ability. Third, e learning proved more effective than role play. Exploring interaction effects indicated that student teachers benefited more from the training than medical students.	2015		0.5619999766349792	2.090640068054199	9	1.2569999694824219

140	209942818	209942818	Ensembles of Global Climate Model Variants Designed for the Quantification and Constraint of Uncertainty in Aerosols and Their Radiative Forcing	Tropospheric aerosol radiative forcing has persisted for many years as one of the major causes of uncertainty in global climate model simulations. To sample the range of plausible aerosol and atmospheric states and perform robust statistical analyses of the radiative forcing, it is important to account for the combined effects of many sources of model uncertainty, which is rarely done due to the high computational cost. This paper describes the designs of two ensembles of the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model U.K. Chemistry and Aerosol global climate model and provides the first analyses of the uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and their causes. The first ensemble was designed to comprehensively sample uncertainty in the aerosol state, while the other samples additional uncertainties in the physical model related to clouds, humidity, and radiation, thereby allowing an analysis of uncertainty in the aerosol effective radiative forcing. Each ensemble consists of around 200 simulations of the preindustrial and present day atmospheres. The uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing in our ensembles is comparable to the range of estimates from multimodel intercomparison projects. The mean aerosol effective radiative forcing is 1.45 W/m2 (credible interval of 2.07 to 0.81 W/m2) which encompasses but is more negative than the 1.17 W/m2 in the 2013 Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project and 0.90 W/m2 in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. The ensembles can be used to reduce aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty by challenging them with multiple measurements as well as to isolate potential causes of multimodel differences.	2019	Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	16	2.9630000591278076
141	219155513	219155513	Is there antibody dependent enhancement in SARS Coronavirus 2?	When a virus enters the host, several types of antibodies are formed. Some of these antibodies are neutralising, which hinders the replication of the virus by inhibiting essential steps such as the interaction of the virus with the host cell receptor. In some viruses, such as flaviviruses, enhancing antibodies are being described, which may facilitate the entry of the virus into the host cells. This immune mediated enhancement of entry and pathogenesis is termed as ADE.[1] ADE can be mediated by Fc receptors or complement receptors.[1] Besides, ADE has been associated with increased severity. Such an effect has been well characterised with dengue, where antibody to one serotype enhances the severity of infection due to another serotype.	2020	Journal of family medicine and primary care	0.875	3.255000114440918	6	0.5249999761581421

The primary causes of liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) hepatitis C virus (HCV) alcohol consumption, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other factors. Aims: The objective of this study was to evaluate the global and sex age region country and etiology related liver cancer burden, as well as the trends in liver cancer caused by different etiologies. Methods: The causes of liver cancer from 1990 to 2017, including global, regional, and national liver cancer incidence, mortality, and etiology, were collected from the Global Burden of Disease study 2017, and the time dependent change in the trends of liver cancer burden was evaluated by annual percentage change. Results: The global liver cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing. There were 950,000 newly diagnosed liver cancer cases and over 800,000 deaths in 2017, which is more than twice the numbers recorded in 1990. HBV and HCV are the major causes of liver cancer. HBV is the major risk factor of liver cancer in Asia, while HCV and alcohol abuse are the major risk factors in the high sociodemographic index and high human development index regions. The mean onset age and incidence of liver cancer with different etiologies have gradually increased in the past 30 years. Conclusions: The global incidence is still rising and the causes have national, regional, or population specificities. More targeted prevention strategies must be developed for the different etiologic types in order to reduce liver cancer burden.	2020	Liver Cancer	0.875	3.255000114440918	6	0.5249999761581421
143	147565567	147565567	The moderating role of entrepreneurship education on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention	A considerable agreement exists about the importance of promoting entrepreneurship to stimulate economic development. In particular, recent research has paid considerable attention to the role of entrepreneurship education in explaining entrepreneurship intentions; also, numerous studies have found empirical evidence for subjective norms affecting the attitude toward entrepreneurial behavior and the perceived control over that behavior. However, cognitive models have not yet considered the moderating role of entrepreneurship education on these relationships. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we analyze how the interaction between entrepreneurship education and subjective norms shapes the perceptions and attitudes toward entrepreneurship. To this end, structural equation modeling is applied to data from a sample of 338 final year undergraduates using multi sample analysis. Results show that entrepreneurship education has a significant moderating role, mitigating the relationship between subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, and strengthening the relationship between subjective norms and entrepreneurial attitudes. Results also have relevant implications for women's entrepreneurship.	2016		0.625	2.325000047683716	2	-0.44999998807907104
144	186792950	186792950	The Application of Hierarchical Teaching in Advanced Mathematics Teaching in Colleges and Universities	In recent years, China strongly popularizes and promotes the higher education, and the era of mass higher education has come. The enrollment scale of higher institutes is continuously expanding, which also directly results in the decline of college students' comprehensive quality and obvious difference in basic quality between individuals. With insufficient teaching staff and increasing teaching difficulty, the teaching quality cannot satisfy students' basic learning demand currently, and there are serious problems in teaching management and students' management. Therefore, in order to ensure the teaching quality of colleges and universities, teachers are required to actively make innovations on teaching mode, satisfy the learning demand of different students, realize the diversification of teaching mode and ensure the teaching quality. Advanced mathematics is the public basic course in colleges and universities, and students of most majors need to learn it. It is the basis for students to learn other professional courses and plays an important role in improving students' comprehensive ability. College students come from different regions, and there is obvious difference between individuals. If teachers adopt unified teaching method, the effectiveness of classroom teaching will be impacted, which is not conductive to the joint improvement of all students. The application of hierarchical teaching in advanced mathematics can meet the learning demands of different students, realize the joint improvement of all students, and play an important role in students' growth and development, which deserves teachers' in depth research and application. 1. The Necessity and Significance of Applying Hierarchical Teaching in Advanced Mathematics 1.1 The Necessity of Applying Hierarchical Teaching in Advanced Mathematics Advanced mathematics, an important pubic basic course, belongs to compulsory course for most majors. It can comprehensively improve students' overall competence and basic capacity so that they can grasp thinking mode of mathematics, improve scientific competence, and further promote the learning of professional courses to lay a good foundation for the growth and development. Because college students come from different provinces and regions, there is large difference in learning basis. In the teaching of advanced mathematics, teachers are required to perform individualized teaching, give full play to students' specialties, and realize the improvement of all students. In traditional teaching mode, teachers adopted unified teaching content, teaching programme and teaching plan, and students' growth is constrained. The learning burden of many students with lower requirement of mathematics is increased, and learning enthusiasm is declined. Whereas, the learning of some students with higher demand for mathematics cannot be fully satisfied, which influences the overall improvement of teaching quality. The adoption of hierarchical teaching can meet the learning demands of different students, suitable for basic educational concept of individualized teaching [1] The knowledge of advanced mathematics is relatively abstract and the logic is strong, so some students will encounter many problems in learning advanced mathematics. In the advanced mathematics classroom, students need to accept the knowledge which is more difficult in depth and width than middle school mathematics in a short period, so many students cannot adapt to it.

Abstract Christopher Alexander has been a leading pioneer of academic research on architectural and urban design since the early 1960s. He is also a practicing architect and builder with a passion for creating and restoring life and beauty to our physical environment. In this essay I review, evaluate, and reflect on some of his particularly fruitful, promising, or problematic ideas. I will put forth some ideas of my own for clarification, and to indicate avenues for future research. I argue that Alexander's notion of patterns (a verbal medium for capturing and conveying design knowledge in a systematic, reusable form) is in need of conceptual development along lines I suggest, even though Alexander downplayed the significance of patterns as he moved on to other theoretical ideas (mainly about aesthetics) later in his career. While I go into some detail about selected parts of Alexander's work, the intended readership of this essay is not restricted to specialists. I have made an effort to provide guidance and background information to readers not already familiar with Alexander's comprehensive body of theory.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	1	-0.6940000057220459

Un enfoque practico	"Esta contribucion tuvo como objetivo proponer un enfoque practico para poder utilizar herramientas que permitan determinar aquellos articulos mas citados, utilizando los valores del indice h reportado. Se realizo la busqueda en dos directorios: Google Academico, empleando el denominado POP y en Scopus, en relacion con los terminos: Gestion del conocimiento en el titulo de los articulos y Knowledge management, es decir el mismo termino en idioma ingles. Se compararon los articulos mas citados en relacion con los dos terminos de busqueda y se pudo determinar que los articulos encontrados en idioma espanol en Scopus, no han sido referidos en GA. Para los articulos en idioma ingles se presenta una discrepancia entre las citas reportadas y el indice h reportado en Scopus y la posicion de estos en el Google Academico. Estos resultados sugieren que la busqueda utilizando el POP para determinar los articulos con mas citas debe ser analizada con cautela o el autor puede considerar como mas importantes referencias: libros, o articulos publicados en revistas de menor impacto. El caracter gratuito del Google Academico y de la herramienta empleada el POP, unido al hecho de que muchos investigadores no tengan acceso a Scopus, conduce a la utilizacion de herramientas como el POP. Sin una conceptualizacion precisa del termino de busqueda y la revision de este tanto en espanol, como en ingles y el no realizar una analisis de los resultados obtenidos para considerar las revistas de mayor impacto y las posible comparacion de autores, puede conducir a que la utilizacion del Google Academico produzca ""estados del arte"" de muy baja calidad. Como lineas de investigacion importantes para futuras investigaciones se recomienda la realizacion de estudios para otros terminos y en particular para distintas ramas de las ciencias, asi como la posibilidad de poder analizar las formas de poder determinar una real genealogia de los posibles articulos seminales."	2017		0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	3	-0.2070000022649765

In the financial market, the stock price prediction is one of the most challenging topics. This paper presents design and implementation of a stacked system to predict the stock price of the next day. This approach is a method that considers the historical data of the real stock prices from Yahoo Finance. This model uses the wavelet transform technique to reduce the noise of market data, and stacked auto encoder to filter unimportant features from preprocessed data. Finally, recurrent neural network and bidirectional long short term memory are used to predict the future stock price. We evaluate our model by analyzing the performance of different models with time series evaluation criteria.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716

To study the dynamic properties of such devices, a controlled laboratory bushing prototype is designed and fabricated. This device has the capability of varying different combinations of long and short flow passages and flow restriction elements. Transient experiments with step up and step down excitations are conducted on the prototype, and the transmitted force responses are measured. The transient properties of several commonly seen hydraulic bushing designs are experimentally studied. Analytical models for bushings with different design features are developed based on the linear system theory. System parameters are then estimated for step responses based on theory and measurements. Finally, the linear models are utilized to analyze the step force measurements, from which some nonlinearities of the bushing system are identified. CITATION: Chai, T. Dreyer, J. and Singh, R.

In this paper, a new robust blind image watermarking scheme based on Region of Interest (ROI) using Arnold scrambling is proposed. The proposed scheme satisfies the requirements via using a watermark generated from the host image, the used embedding strategy and Arnold scrambling. In this paper, the ROI of the host image is used as the watermark image. First level DWT is applied to the watermark and approximation coefficients are chosen as information to be embedded. Each approximation coefficient is embedded into the low frequency sub band of a selected block of the host image in the wavelet domain. Before embedding, Arnold scrambling is performed on the approximation coefficients of the watermark as well as the blocks of the host image. This makes the scheme more robust and secure. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves high degree of security, imperceptibility and robustness against the variety of attacks.	2016		0.625	2.325000047683716	2	-0.44999998807907104

By integrating OER and HER/CO2RR with renewable energy, it may potentially provide a promising way for a sustainable human society. Nonetheless, lack of understanding of catalysts under working conditions and reaction mechanisms restrict the development of efficient catalysts. In recent years, in situ techniques that can be used to investigate the structural transformation of catalysts during the reaction have attracted considerable research interest. Herein, recent developments in heterogeneous catalysts for OER, HER, and CO2RR explored by using in situ X ray diffraction and X ray absorption spectroscopy techniques have been comprehensively summarized. Finally, challenges and future perspectives in this field are also provided to pave the way for future developments.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	2	-0.44999998807907104

There are many sophisticated schedulers that are widely deployed in the base stations, such as Proportional Fairness (PF) and Round Robin Fashion (RRF) It is known that the Opportunistic (OP) scheduling is the optimal scheduler for maximizing the average user data rate (AUDR) considering the full buffer traffic. But the optimal strategy achieving the highest fairness still remains largely unknown both in the full buffer traffic and the bursty traffic. In this work, we investigate the problem of fairnessoriented user scheduling, especially for the RBG allocation. We build a user scheduler using Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) which conducts distributional optimization to maximize the fairness of the communication system. The agents take the cross layer information (e.g. RSRP, Buffer size) as state and the RBG allocation result as action, then explore the optimal solution following a well defined reward function designed for maximizing fairness. Furthermore, we take the 5% tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the key performance indicator (KPI) of fairness, and compare the performance of MARL scheduling with PF scheduling and RRF scheduling by conducting extensive simulations. And the simulation results show that the proposed MARL scheduling outperforms the traditional schedulers.	2020	ArXiv	0.875	3.255000114440918	4	0.03700000047683716

We examined foraging and movement patterns of 20 wild ship rats (Rattus rattus) within a large, outdoor 'U maze' that was either illuminated or dark to assess if light (an indirect predation cue) could deter rodents from ecologically vulnerable locations. Light did not alter rats' foraging behaviour (latency to approach seed tray, visits to seed tray, time per visit to seed tray, total foraging duration, foraging rate) within the experimental resource patch but three of seven movement behaviours were significantly impaired (53% fewer visits to the maze, 70% less exploration within the maze, 40% slower movement within the maze) The total time males spent exposed to illumination also declined by 45 minutes per night, unlike females. Individual visits tended to be longer under illumination, but the latency to visit and the latency to cross through the U maze were unaffected by illumination. Elevating predation risk with illumination may be a useful pest management technique for reducing ship rat activity, particularly in island ecosystems where controlling mammalian predators is paramount to preserving biodiversity.	2019	Scientific Reports	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716

The resultant blocks were subjected to two hours mineral carbonation at (3 day) after demoulding to enhance the CO2 uptake and sequester carbon in the blocks. Along with that, 28 days compressive strength of un carbonated blocks was determined to gauge the effect of biochar as the filler material on the strength of the specimens. Results showed that there was an enhanced CO2 uptake on 3 days compressive strength and biochar dosage was optimised at 4% and 6% depending on the chosen mix. The 28 days compressive strength of un carbonated blocks showed that there was an increase in the strength as biochar addition increased to a certain extent, however, thereafter it decreased with the further addition of biochar.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	5	0.2809999883174896

Background The treatment efficacy after CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) have not been adequately addressed. The purpose of this study was to investigate pattern of recurrence according to irradiation field after CyberKnife SBRT for early stage non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Methods This retrospective study included patients with peripheral cT1/2N0M0 NSCLC that was treated with SBRT using a CyberKnife between May 2013 and March 2016 at single institute and followed up by more than two imaging examinations. Both operable and inoperable patients were included. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) curves were estimated using the Kaplan Meier method with 95% confidence intervals (CI) Cumulative incidence curves of recurrence were calculated and compared using the Gray's test. Results Total 71 patients were included and analyzed in this study. The median follow up period for surviving patients was 34 months (range, 7 64 months) The 2 year OS and PFS rate were 93% (95% CI: 83 97% and 77% (95% CI: 65 86% respectively. The 2 year cumulative incidence rate of infield recurrence and out of field recurrence were 6% (95% CI: 2 14% and 17% (95% CI: 9 27% respectively. Gross tumor volume (GTV) =9 mL and diagnosis to treatment interval (DTI) =90 days were significantly associated with infield recurrence (P<0.001 and P=0.007) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was significantly associated with out of field recurrence (P=0.014) Conclusions Treatment efficacy after CyberKnife SBRT for peripheral early stage NSCLC was identical to previous conventional linac based SBRT reports. With short follow up period, it was found that GTV and DTI were the significant predictive factor of infield recurrence, and EGFR mutation was the significant predictive factor of out of field recurrence.	2019	Journal of thoracic disease	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	7	0.7689999938011169

We investigated how official guidance documents and academic publications have classified procedures in terms of whether or not they are aerosol generating. We performed a rapid systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses standards. Guidelines, policy documents and academic papers published in english or french offering guidance on aerosol generating procedures were eligible. We systematically searched two medical databases (medline, cochrane central) and one public search engine (google) in march and april 2020. Data on how each procedure was classified by each source were extracted. We determined the level of agreement across different guidelines for each procedure group, in terms of its classification as aerosol generating, possibly aerosol generating, or nonaerosol generating. 128 documents met our inclusion criteria; they contained 1248 mentions of procedures that we categorised into 39 procedure groups. Procedures classified as aerosol generating or possibly aerosol generating by =90% of documents included autopsy, surgery/postmortem procedures with high speed devices, intubation and extubation procedures, bronchoscopy, sputum induction, manual ventilation, airway suctioning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tracheostomy and tracheostomy procedures, non invasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy, breaking closed ventilation systems, nebulised or aerosol therapy, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation. Disagreements existed between sources on some procedure groups, including oral and dental procedures, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, thoracic surgery and procedures, and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing. There is sufficient evidence of agreement across different international guidelines to classify certain procedure groups as aerosol generating. However, some clinically relevant procedures received surprisingly little mention in our source documents. To reduce dissent on the remainder, we recommend that (a) clinicians define procedures more clearly and specifically, breaking them down into their constituent components where possible; (b) researchers undertake further studies of aerosolisation during these procedures; and (c) guideline making and policy making bodies address a wider range of procedures.	2020	BMJ open respiratory research	0.875	3.255000114440918	19	3.694999933242798

Cette pathologie conduit a un risque accru de troubles visuels severes tels qu'un decollement retinien, une degeneration choroidienne, une cataracte ou un glaucome. Plusieurs etudes ont prouve l'interet de l'administration journaliere d'atropine a faible concentration pour bloquer l'evolution de la myopie juvenile. Le dosage de 0,1 mg/mL presente la meilleure balance benefice risque. Pour repondre aux demandes, un collyre d'atropine a 0,1 mg/mL a ete developpe a partir de la specialite a 10 mg/mL. La stabilite physico chimique et microbiologique de cette preparation hospitaliere est de 6 mois a temperature ambiante. L'objectif de ce travail est d'etudier notre cohorte de patients depuis la mise a disposition du collyre d'atropine 0,1 mg/mL soit de mai 2016 a aout 2018. Materiels et methode Les prescriptions de collyre d'atropine dispense en retrocession ont ete extraites du logiciel Phedra(r) Les elements suivants ont ete releves evolution de la file active au cours du temps, age et sexe des patients, posologie et origine des prescripteurs. Resultats et discussion La file active de patients augmente de facon lineaire sur la periode etudiee pour atteindre 64 patients en aout 2018. Quatre vingt trois pour cent des patients ont entre 6 et 15 ans, 9 entre 2 et 5 ans et 9 entre 16 et 29 ans. Il s'agit en majorite de filles 58 vs 42 Les durees de traitement sont tres variables de 1 mois a 2 ans a ce jour. La posologie est systematiquement de 1 goutte par jour dans les deux yeux. L'administration est preconisee tantot le matin tantot le soir selon une repartition 50/50. On note une democratisation de la prescription avec une origine uniquement hospitaliere en 2016, puis une part de prescriptions de ville qui augmente egalement de facon lineaire. Conclusion L'augmentation de notre file active est le reflet du probleme croissant de la myopie dans les pays developpes lie probablement a l'utilisation intensive des ecrans par les enfants allant de pair avec une moindre exposition a la lumiere naturelle. Cette etude montre une heterogeneite du mode d'administration tantot le soir tantot le matin. Or, dans la litterature une administration le soir etait plutot preconisee pour limiter le risque d'effets indesirables. A ce jour, et compte tenu de la diversite de l'origine des prescriptions, il n'a pas ete possible de recueillir des donnees d'efficacite clinique. Une etude de plus grande envergure evaluant l'effet du traitement par collyre d'atropine faiblement dose par rapport aux prises en charge non pharmacologiques serait utile.	2019	Le Pharmacien Hospitalier et Clinicien	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	6	0.5249999761581421

Active biodegradable packaging films were developed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chitosan (CS) and d Limonene (DL) The effect of various DL content levels (0% 2.5% 5% 7.5% and 10% w/w) on the structural, mechanical, biodegradable and antimicrobial properties of PVA/CS films was systematically studied. Good compatibility between DL and PVA/CS, and good dispersion of DL in the PVA/CS matrix were demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) PVA/CS films greatly improved their antibacterial, mechanical and barrier properties, which are associated with the considerable biodegradability, after they were incorporated with DL. However, the overloading with DL may weaken hydrogen bonds between polymer chains, resulting in the negative effects on the physical performances of the film. Particularly, the PVA/CS/DL 5% film showed the highest water contact angle and transmittance value, and also showed effective preservations of packaged mango fruits during 10 day of storage at 20 2 degC, based on the characterization by fruits weight loss, decay rate, firmness, titratable acidity, soluble solids, and ascorbic acid. Consequently, DL/PVA/CS composite films may be a promising eco friendly packaging material for food preservation.	2019	International journal of biological macromolecules	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	6	0.5249999761581421

Therefore, the article implements adaptive update of traffic collection data based on time decay factor, thus ensuring effective prediction of short term transit time. First, data collection is carried out on urban road conditions, and the missing data of traffic flow is complemented by a combination of time and space. Subsequently, the road condition is divided according to the traffic state index, and the semi supervised k Nearest Neighbor Means (k NNM) clustering algorithm is used to obtain the typical similar road segments, for the to be predicted samples and the historical collection samples. Finally, based on the time decay factor, the weighted value of the historical typical similar road segment sample data is weighted, so that the validity of the data value is measured by the time distance, and the transit time prediction model is satisfied to meet the requirements of the road condition update. Experiments show the effectiveness and applicability of the method, so as to provide real time updated road condition data for the prediction of road transit time.	2019	2019 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems (ICCCS)	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	2	-0.44999998807907104

166	76649435	76649435	Understanding procrastination: A motivational approach	Abstract Procrastination is often seen as a self regulatory failure. We want to offer a perspective that shifts the focus from volitional to motivational aspects of procrastination. In an attempt to demystify the phenomenon, we combine two studies exploring the motivational foundations of procrastination with a study aiming to uncover its implicit normative connotations. Study 1 investigated the link between value orientations and procrastination at a general level, showing that people high in procrastination entertain low achievement and high well being value orientations. Study 2 investigated the link between self determination and procrastination within and across daily activities. Low self determination related to low levels of activity completion and to procrastination in general. Finally, Study 3 investigated the link between value as well as political orientations and perceptions of procrastination. Individuals who favored modern, conservative values were more likely to attribute academic procrastination as personal failure, whereas individuals who endorsed post modern, liberal values were more likely to consider situational causes of academic procrastination. Against this background, we argue for a less normative view on procrastination and recommend motivational (e.g. goal selection) rather than volitional (e.g. goal implementation) interventions to prevent procrastination.	2018		0.75	2.7899999618530273	2	-0.44999998807907104

TriviaQA includes 95K question answer pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents, six per question on average, that provide high quality distant supervision for answering the questions. We show that, in comparison to other recently introduced large scale datasets, TriviaQA (1) has relatively complex, compositional questions, (2) has considerable syntactic and lexical variability between questions and corresponding answer evidence sentences, and (3) requires more cross sentence reasoning to find answers. We also present two baseline algorithms: a feature based classifier and a state of the art neural network, that performs well on SQuAD reading comprehension.

Computer assisted detection and diagnosis, and image segmentation and registration have significantly benefited from AI. However, integration of AI into the clinical workflow has been slow due to requirements for libraries that are specific to each model, and also environments that are specific to clinical centers. These challenges demonstrate the need for an AI based solution that can be integrated into any environment with minimum hardware and software overhead. Tesseract Medical Imaging (Tesseract MI) is an open source, web based platform which enables deployment of AI models while simultaneously providing standard image viewing and reporting schemes. The goal of Tesseract MI is to augment 3D medical imaging and provide a 4th dimension (AI) when requested by a user. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of our platform and present ProstateCancer.ai, a web application for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer in MRI.	2019	Medical Imaging	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	8	1.0130000114440918

However, this socio economic development, fueled by coal, has heavily impacted the energy landscape and the environment. Today, China is both the global largest polluter and largest developer of clean energy systems. The unprecedented extent of the country's power sector challenges and opportunities requires to refine current capacity planning models to better inform policy making. Focusing on climate urgency, this study contributes to filling this need by proposing new modeling frameworks. These models offer a fine grain analysis of China's power sector decarbonization potential, by grounding long term electricity mix expansion planning into inter sectoral development. Using large datasets of technical, economic and social factors, levers of the clean power transition are analyzed by quantifying and comparing their decarbonization potential, technical feasibility, and cost efficiency over time and across regions and resources. The first lever lies in the coordinated expansion of a low carbon electricity grid, resilient to renewable energy intermittency and disparities in space and time between energy resources and demand. The high resolution model SWITCH China is used to explore optimal capacity expansion pathways for China's electricity mix under various low carbon policies. Results show that, while natural gas can become a bridge between the current coal dominated grid and a future clean electricity mix, a deep decarbonization scenario mostly relies on the concomitant deployment of nuclear inland, encouraged by advanced nuclear technology development wind, solar, energy storage, coal with carbon capture and storage, and an expanded transmission network. Meeting this long term decarbonization goal increases electricity costs significantly compared to an unconstrained scenario. A modular approach, adaptable to traditional cost minimizing tools used by planning agencies, is proposed to reduce uncertainty of future technological costs as well as costs resulting from electricity generation intermittency. The model finds that there exist alternatives to the least cost strategy, which present slightly higher overall electricity costs, but much lower risks. In particular, given the predominance of fossil fuel in the current electricity mix, the deployment of low carbon systems decreases the overall risk on future costs through diversification, even by accounting for increased operational complexity resulting from renewable energy intermittency. The second lever is the integration of linkages between power and water supply into the optimization framework, as China currently faces both severe water shortages and severe water pollution. Results show that, while total costs of the South to North Water Transfer Project are 2.5 times lower than nuclear desalination, the latter emits six times less CO2. In addition, fresh water from nuclear desalination is shown to be affordable even to the poorest households. Challenges posed by the construction and operation of interregional water diversion suggest that it should only be used in dry inland areas, while low carbon desalination could be developed at larger scale near coastal economic centers. The DESEC model is developed to explore controllable desalination, powered by nuclear, wind, or solar energy, as a mean to alleviate water scarcity in coastal regions while enabling the wide deployment of a low curtailment clean power base. Desalination, used as a deferrable load, can transform two low value products, seawater and excess power from non dispatchable energies, in a high value product, fresh water. The DESEC model finds that the North China Grid region's entire water deficit 61.4 billion m3 can be met entirely by deferrable desalination with a total cost of about $1.5/m3, less than the global average water price. Analyses conclude that there exist local alternatives to current national scale power and water diversion projects, more adapted to regional characteristics, less prone to risks and disruptions. The third lever is the electrification of urban passenger cars, as the sector is poised for massive expansion in the next decade. Findings show that the near term deployment of electric vehicles cannot be enabled by technology cost decrease alone. If the current impact from favorable policy is maintained but not amplified, CO2 emissions from urban passenger cars will peak around 2040, or ten years past the official 2030 carbon peak target. In fact, although it demonstrates higher costs in the near term, large scale vehicle electrification is the least cost, least CO2 emission pathway for China's urban transportation expansion in the long run. Generally, model results reveal that massive investment is needed in RaD and infrastructure capacity deployment, and that utilities and institutions must be reformed to manage resources rationally, hand in hand. Many of the studied decarbonization options have not reached a mature stage or have not been deployed at utility scale today, and future work is required to better account for modeling and data uncertainty. Yet, models developed, used and presented in this study all reveal the existence of viable, cost efficient options to enable meaningful decarbonization while alleviating water scarcity and air pollution. These strategies can only be achieved by combining central scale coordination with local scale implementation, to take advantage of China's diverse and rich territory while minimizing risks. This dissertation provides new approaches for identifying realistic, affordable capacity expansion pathways, rigorously designed by mathematical optimization and large datasets, to reduce CO2 emissions related to the power sector in line with climate targets. The impact that China will have on climate change and its ability to ensure its long term sustainability will depend on actual decisions and actions undertaken by governmental and private entities. The success of the clean energy transition is contingent on the country's ability to encourage technological, economic and institutional innovation."	2018		0.75	2.7899999618530273	1	-0.6940000057220459
172	3635693	3635693	A New Combinatorial Design of Coded Distributed Computing	Coded distributed computing introduced by Li et al. in 2015 is an efficient approach to trade computing power to reduce the communication load in general distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce. In particular, Li et al. show that increasing the computation load in the Map phase by a factor of $r$ can create coded multicasting opportunities to reduce the communication load in the Reduce phase by the same factor. However, there are two major limitations in practice. First, it requires an exponentially large number of input files (data batches) when the number of computing nodes gets large. Second, it forces every $s$ computing nodes to compute one Map function, which leads to a large number of Map functions required to achieve the promised gain. In this paper, we make an attempt to overcome these two limitations by proposing a novel coded distributed computing approach based on a combinatorial design. We demonstrate that when the number of computing nodes becomes large, 1) the proposed approach requires an exponentially less number of input files; 2) the required number of Map functions is also reduced exponentially. Meanwhile, the resulting computation communication trade off maintains the multiplicative gain compared to conventional uncoded unicast and achieves the information theoretic lower bound asymmetrically for some system parameters.	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	0.75	2.7899999618530273	3	-0.2070000022649765

Polysomnography is the ""gold standard"" for OSA diagnosis; however, it is expensive and not widely available. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the available questionnaires for screening OSA.SourceWe carried out a literature search through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to identify eligible studies. The methodological validity of each study was assessed using the Cochrane Methods Group's guideline.Principal findingsTen studies (n 1,484 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire was the most common questionnaire (four studies) followed by the Wisconsin sleep questionnaire (two studies) Four studies were conducted exclusively on ""sleep disorder patients"" and six studies were conducted on ""patients without history of sleep disorders"" For the first group, pooled sensitivity was 72.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.0 78.0% I2 23.0% and pooled specificity was 61.0% (95% CI: 55.0 67.0% I2 43.8% For the second group, pooled sensitivity was 77.0% (95% CI: 73.0 80.0% I2 78.1% and pooled specificity was 53.0% (95% CI: 50 57% I2 88.8% The risk of verification bias could not be eliminated in eight studies due to insufficient reporting. Studies on snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, and high blood pressure (STOP) and STOP including body mass index, age, neck circumference, gender (Bang) questionnaires had the highest methodological quality.ConclusionThe existing evidence regarding the accuracy of OSA questionnaires is associated with promising but inconsistent results. This inconsistency could be due to studies with heterogeneous design (population, questionnaire type, validity) STOP and STOP Bang questionnaires for screening of OSA in the surgical population are suggested due to their higher methodological quality and easy to use features.ResumeObjectifL'apnee obstructive du sommeil (AOS) peut provoquer des problemes de sante fatals si elle n'est pas diagnostiquee.

This study examined trends in the increase of the wire`s resistance and the characteristics of its recovery from quenching by a current applied cycle at temperatures of 90 K, 180 K, and 250 K. The procedure was conducted based on the thickness and presence (or absence) of the insulating wire layers. To achieve this, YBCO thin film wires with the same critical temperatures were prepared with copper and stainless steel stabilizing layers. At levels one, three, and five with superior performance, polyimide pressure sensitive adhesive tape was attached to the wires at a very low temperature. The eight prepared test samples were wound around the linear frames. The wire`s voltage and current created from the phase change characteristics were measured at the wire`s prescribed temperature, using the four point probe method. The wire`s resistance and recovery characteristics were examined for each cycle at temperatures of 90 K, 180 K, and 250 K.	2013		0.43799999356269836	1.6293599605560303	3	-0.2070000022649765

For Dtr. history, the presence of YHWH is not to give words but to reveal the function of YHWH's power to Israel and against the enemies of Israel. Dissimilarly, the ecstacy in the book of Ezekiel has the function of raising up the prophet and giving him missions in the apparent purpose to give YHWH's will and words. Ruah YHWH and Yad YHWH moves Ezekiel by the purpose and sovereign will of God nd and have connection with the God's calling Ezekiel. And the ecstacy of Ezekiel accomplishes its summit at the messages of promise to restore Israel which revealed in the valley of dried bones. While the ecstacy in the Dtr. history is dynamic and has the primary purpose to ratify YHWH's selection and its authority, the ecstacy of Ezekiel is capable of carrying out the function to convey the will and words of YHWH. And in that meaning RUAH YHWH and Yad YHWH reveal same concept and actions. Ecstacy, a method of revealing the presence of YHWH, had the function of selection, ratification and power of God through RUAR YHWH and the presence of YHWH was restricted to minimal individuals in Dtr. history.

Dalam penelitian ini, peneliti menggunakan metode historis, yaitu meliputi pengumpulan sumber baik lisan maupun tulisan, kritik sumber, interpretasi, dan historiografi. Untuk lebih memahami permasalahan yang dikaji, maka penulis menggunakan beberapa konsep yang relevan dengan permasalahan yang sedang dibahas seperti pembangunan pertanian dan perubahan sosial, dan perubahan ekonomi, untuk memperdalam analisis fakta. Temuan yang didapat dari hasil penelitian yaitu: pertama, tujuan pelaksanaan revolusi hijau dalam rangka peningkatan hasil produksi tahun 1970 1984, dapat dicapai di Kecamatan Panumbangan. Kedua, pola pikir masyarakat berkembang menjadi lebih baik mengingat dalam penyuluhan, petani diberi pembekalan pembekalan dalam mengolah lahan pertanian mereka dengan menggunakan teknologi modern. Kelompok tani sering melakukan temu wicara baik itu intern kelompok maupun antar kelompok untuk saling bertukar pengalaman mengenai perkembangan pelaksanaan program revolusi hijau di lahan garapan masing masing. Ketiga, selain berdampak positif, program revolusi hijau di Kecamatan Panumbangan juga meninggalkan dampak negatif, yaitu pencemaran lingkungan akibat penggunaan pupuk buatan dan pestisida. Kemudian muncul kesenjangan sosial antara petani kaya dan petani miskin. Peningkatan hasil produksi pertanian disertai juga dengan meningkatnya modal yang digunakan untuk produksi sebagai akibat dari kenaikan pupuk dan pestisida sehingga tidak serta merta meningkatkan kesejahteraan semua masyarakat Panumbangan terlebih petani kecil dan buruh tani.

In this study, researchers used the historical method, which includes the collection of both oral and written sources, source criticism, interpretation, and historiography. To better understand the issues that were examined, the authors use some concepts that are relevant to the issues being discussed such as agricultural development and social change, and economic change, to deepen the analysis of the facts. The findings of the research are: first, the purpose of the green revolution in order to increase production in 1970 1984, can be achieved in District Panumbangan. Second, the public mindset develop into better considering the extension, farmers were given a briefing in processing their agricultural land by using modern technology. Farmer groups often do colloquium both internally and among groups to exchange experiences on the development of the implementation of the green revolution in arable land each. Third, in addition to a positive impact, the green revolution in Sub Panumbangan also left a negative impact, the environmental pollution caused by the use of artificial fertilizers and pesticides.

However, most of the existing beamspace channel estimation schemes have been designed for narrowband systems, while the rather scarce wideband solutions tend to assume that the sparse beamspace channel exhibits a common support in the frequency domain, which has a limited validity owing to the effect of beam squint caused by the wide bandwidth in practice. In this paper, we investigate the wideband beamspace channel estimation problem without the common support assumption. Specifically, by exploiting the effect of beam squint, we first prove that each path component of the wideband beamspace channel exhibits a unique frequency dependent sparse structure. Inspired by this structure, we then propose a successive support detection (SSD) based beamspace channel estimation scheme, which successively estimates all the sparse path components following the classical idea of successive interference cancellation. For each path component, its support at different frequencies is jointly estimated to improve the accuracy by utilizing the proved sparse structure, and its influence is removed to estimate the remaining path components. The performance analysis shows that the proposed SSD based scheme can accurately estimate the wideband beamspace channel at a low complexity. Simulation results verify that the proposed SSD based scheme enjoys a reduced pilot overhead, and yet achieves an improved channel estimation accuracy.	2019	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	5	0.2809999883174896

Minimizing the impact of disasters is imperative in today's society. As the capabilities of software and hardware evolve, so does the role of information and communication technology in disaster mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery. A large quantity of disaster related data is available, including response plans, records of previous incidents, simulation data, social media data, and Web sites. However, current data management solutions offer few or no integration capabilities. Moreover, recent advances in cloud computing, big data, and NoSQL open the door for new solutions in disaster data management. In this paper, a Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) framework is proposed for disaster cloud data management (Disaster CDM) with the objectives of 1) storing large amounts of disaster related data from diverse sources, 2) facilitating search, and 3) supporting their interoperability and integration. Data are stored in a cloud environment using a combination of relational and NoSQL databases. The case study presented in this paper illustrates the use of Disaster CDM on an example of simulation models.	2013	2013 Workshops on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises	0.43799999356269836	1.6293599605560303	4	0.03700000047683716

To address this gap, this paper presents the findings of a systematic review on studies devoted to collaboration on BIMCPs over the past 10 years (2006 2016) To this end, 208 studies published in 12 ICT oriented journals in the construction context are thoroughly reviewed. The findings bring to light that studies on collaboration on BIMCPs are sporadic, isolated and focus on narrowed, limited and disjointed areas associated with collaboration. The study contributes to the field through highlighting the gaps of the existing literature on the topic. This provides a stepping stone to direct future inquiries that target collaboration on BIMCPs.	2017		0.6880000233650208	2.5593600273132324	4	0.03700000047683716

Cognitive bias modification (CBM) could beneficially impact problematic approach behavior. However, it is unclear which mechanisms are targeted by CBM in obesity. Candidate mechanisms include: (1) altering reward value of food stimuli; and (2) strengthening inhibitory abilities. Thirty three obese adults completed either CBM or sham training during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. CBM consisted of implicit training to approach healthy and avoid unhealthy foods. At baseline, approach tendencies towards food were present in all participants. Avoiding vs. approaching food was associated with higher activity in the right angular gyrus (rAG) CBM resulted in a diminished approach bias towards unhealthy food, decreased activation in the rAG, and increased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex. Relatedly, functional connectivity between the rAG and right superior frontal gyrus increased. Analysis of brain connectivity during rest revealed training related connectivity changes of the inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyri. Taken together, CBM strengthens avoidance tendencies when faced with unhealthy foods and alters activity in brain regions underpinning behavioral inhibition.	2019	Nutrients	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	4	0.03700000047683716

The first separation of enantiomers in capillary electrophoresis (CE) counts slightly longer than three decades. Fast development of the practice and theory of chiral CE occurred in the past 30 years and today one can consider this technology to have a solid and mature theoretical background. The goal of the present review is not only to summarize the history and contemporary theory of enantioseparations by using CE but also to present the authors personal view where shall we head to with this attractive technology not only from the viewpoint of separation of enantiomers but also for better understanding the mechanisms of non covalent (enantioselective) interactions in chemistry, biology, medicine and related disciplines.	2018	Journal of chromatography.

Most emotion recognizers extract prosodic features from an input speech in order to use emotion recognition. However, prosodic features changes drastically depending on the uttered text. In order to solve this problem, we have proposed the normalization method of prosodic features by using the synthesized speech, which has the same word sequence but uttered with a ""neutral"" emotion. In this method, all prosodic features (pitch, power, etc. are normalized. However, nobody knows which kind of prosodic features should be normalized. In this paper, all combinations of with/without normalization were examined, and the most appropriate normalization method was found. When both ""RMS Energy"" (root mean square frame energy) and ""VoiceProb"" (power of harmonics divided by the total power) were normalized, emotion recognition accuracy became 5.98% higher than the recognition accuracy without normalization."	2013	2013 Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference	0.43799999356269836	1.6293599605560303	3	-0.2070000022649765
190	195845591	195845591	A marine bacterial enzymatic cascade degrades the algal polysaccharide ulvan	Marine seaweeds increasingly grow into extensive algal blooms, which are detrimental to coastal ecosystems, tourism and aquaculture. However, algal biomass is also emerging as a sustainable raw material for the bioeconomy. The potential exploitation of algae is hindered by our limited knowledge of the microbial pathways and hence the distinct biochemical functions of the enzymes involved that convert algal polysaccharides into oligo and monosaccharides. Understanding these processes would be essential, however, for applications such as the fermentation of algal biomass into bioethanol or other value added compounds. Here, we describe the metabolic pathway that enables the marine flavobacterium Formosa agariphila to degrade ulvan, the main cell wall polysaccharide of bloom forming Ulva species. The pathway involves 12 biochemically characterized carbohydrate active enzymes, including two polysaccharide lyases, three sulfatases and seven glycoside hydrolases that sequentially break down ulvan into fermentable monosaccharides. This way, the enzymes turn a previously unexploited renewable into a valuable and ecologically sustainable bioresource.Elucidation of a multi enzyme pathway for degradation of the polysaccharide ulvan by Formosa agariphila provides tools to use ulvan biomass from marine algal blooms as feedstock for renewable sources of carbohydrates.	2019	Nature Chemical Biology	0.8119999766349792	3.0206398963928223	19	3.694999933242798

A new stimulus triggered electromyography (EMG) test for detecting stimulus diffusion to contralateral intercostal muscles during thoracic pedicle screw placement was assessed in a porcine model. Objective. To determine if electromyographic thresholds in the intercostal muscles of both sides of the thorax could discriminate thoracic pedicle screw malpositions with and without neural contact at different aspects of the spinal cord and nerve roots. Summary of Background Data. There is controversy about the value of triggered EMG stimulation for aiding precise insertion of thoracic pedicle screws. A universally validated threshold that confirms screw malposition has not been established. Diffusion of EMG responses to the contralateral intercostal muscles has not previously been investigated. Methods. Nine domestic pigs weighing 60 to 75 kg had 108 pedicle screws placed bilaterally in the thoracic spine from T8 T13. Before spine instrumentation, neural structures were stimulated in 4 animals under direct vision at different anatomic locations from T9 T12. Recording electrodes were placed over the right and left intercostal muscles. Increasing stimulus intensity was applied until muscle response was detected at the contralateral side (EMG diffusion phenomenon) After this first experiment, the thoracic spine was instrumented in all 9 animals. Screws were placed in the pedicle in different positions, the anatomic intrapedicular location and within the spinal canal, with and without contact with the neural elements. Results. Response thresholds to direct nerve root stimulation were significantly lower than those obtained by stimulation of the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord (0.44 0.22 mA vs. 1.38 0.71 mA, P 0.01) However, a 14 fold stimulation intensity (6.50 0.29 mA) was necessary to obtain diffusion of the EMG response to the opposite (left) side if the right nerve root was stimulated. A 2 fold increment (3.17 0.93 mA) elicited diffusion of the EMG responses to the contralateral side when stimulation was applied to the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord. EMG recordings of the 108 stimulated screws showed a significant decrease in the EMG response when the screw was in contact with the spinal cord (2.72 1.48 mA; P 0.01) compared with that found when the pedicle track was intact (mean: 5.01 1.89 mA) Screws violating the medial wall of the pedicle, but not touching neural tissues, responded to slightly lower intensities than well positioned screws, but this was not statistically significant (3.91 1.39 mA vs. 4.89 1.30 mA, P 0.05) Conclusion. Stimulus triggered EMG can identify screws that violate the medial pedicle wall if they are in contact with neural tissues. EMG thresholds could not discriminate screws that violated the medial pedicle wall without neural contact from screws with accurate intraosseous placement. However, recording EMG potentials at the contralateral intercostal muscles (stimulus diffusion phenomenon) proved to be a reliable method for identifying the neural structures at risk.	2009	Spine	0.18799999356269836	0.6993600130081177	7	0.7689999938011169
192	230567520	230567520	Using scheelite residue and rice husk ash to manufacture lightweight aggregates	Abstract Over the years, the use of expandable clays has supported the world production of lightweight aggregates (LWAs) however the gradual lack of natural resources requires using more sustainable practices. Thus, the aim is to develop LWAs suitable for use in structural lightweight concrete and other engineering services, using scheelite residue (SPR) and rice husk ash (RHA) Studies show that the production of these residues is increasing, their environmental impacts are significant, and their properties favour the development of LWAs. However, no research was found on the use of SPR in LWAs. Raw materials were characterised by laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy, X ray fluorescence, X ray diffraction and simultaneous thermal analysis. Then, 23 mixtures were formulated, from the replacement of clay by up to 100% residues. The samples were sintered at 1100, 1150, 1200 and 1250 degC. The manufactured aggregates were characterised by the bloating index (BI) mass loss (LOI) particle density (rd) water absorption (WA24H) crushing strength (S) mineralogical composition and microstructure. Finally, the feasibility of using the manufactured LWAs was evaluated, based on a comparative analysis with the properties of a commercial LWA. The resulting aggregates showed: (BI) maximum of 77.44% (LOI) of up to 12.0% (rd) varying between 0.86 and 1.80 g/cm3, (WA24H) minimum of 2.0% and (S) up to 13.5 MPa. Overall, 42 specimens demonstrated properties at least similar to the commercial LWA ones. The results reveal that it is technically feasible to use SPR and RHA to produce LWAs.	2021		0.9380000233650208	3.4893600940704346	3	-0.2070000022649765

A series of block copolymers of mPEG b P(DEAx co L ProlAy) (mPEG PDL) bearing L proline catalytic sites and pH responsive poly (diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDEA) segments were synthesized by the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in the presence of methyl polyethylene glycol (mPEG) trithiocarbonate macro RAFT agent. The pH induced self assembly behaviors of three copolymer catalysts with different contents of PDEA were investigated via the combination of UV visible spectrometer (UV vis) dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of these copolymer catalysts were evaluated by direct asymmetric aldol reaction of p nitrobenzaldehyde and cyclohexanone in water. The results indicated that catalytic activity and stereoselectivity effected by the pH value of aqueous solution and the structures of copolymer catalyst assemblies. mPEG PDL 2 give the aldol product with high conv. yield, anti/syn, and ee (92% 91% 92/8, 96% respectively at pH 7.0. Furthermore, these pH responsive copolymers supported L proline are easily recycled by a reversible phase transition.	2020		0.875	3.255000114440918	6	0.5249999761581421

The main objective of this work is to develop a machine learning methodology for classifying eight different transportation modes, including: still, walk, run, bike, car, bus, train, and subway, using data from smartphones sensors. To this end, publicly available datasets were used. For example, a subset of the original SHL dataset, including data obtained from one participant's smartphone embedded sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, pressure sensor) being recorded for 68 days. As classifiers, eight Machine Learning algorithms were employed. The classifiers were firstly developed without Dimensionality Reduction (DR) and then with a DR feature extraction algorithm (Principal Component Analysis PCA) so as to explore the possibility of using lighter models and potentially improve performance. After dimensionality reduction, the algorithms that performed best, accomplished a very good classification result in all classes while training time was significantly reduced.	2020	PETRA	0.875	3.255000114440918	3	-0.2070000022649765

196	220760269	220760269	Precision Landing and Testing of Aerospace Vehicles.	Planetary precision landing in non cooperative sites has been a major challenge. An indoor novel planetary precision landing facility known as Surrey Precision Landing Facility (SPLF) has been developed to bridge the gap between software simulations and outdoor expensive UAV based planetary precision landing testbeds. The 3D motion capture system provides real time accurate navigation data by removing the uncertainty in the position, and thus allows the flexibility to test the planetary terminal descent based Guidance and Control algorithms on quadrotors safely, rapidly, repeatedly with very low operating cost. Quadrotors can follow the trajectory of a planetary lander during its terminal descent. Model Predictive Control (MPC) incorporates input/output constraints in the calculation of the control law and thus can be used for the planetary terminal descent scenarios. Feasibility and computation time have been a key hindrance in practical validation of MPC for quadrotor control. Therefore, a novel single stage linear MPC algorithm in a state space framework has been developed to improve feasibility and computation time over Optimal MPC (OMPC) Laguerre OMPC (LOMPC) and Steady State (SS) OMPC (SSOMPC) by linking reference governor, Closed Loop Paradigm, Steady State Target Optimization and Laguerre function techniques. The novel SSLOMPC algorithm is simulated to test its performance on a simple two state model, and then has been implemented in simulation and practically validated at SPLF on a quadrotor for the set point tracking scenarios. Disturbance rejection and offset free tracking is achieved via a Kalman filter. Simulated and practical implementations of PID, LQR and MPC control laws on a quadrotor helicopter for the Mars terminal descent phase has been performed at SPLF, where SSOMPC/SSLOMPC successfully demonstrates the ability to respect the control input and output constraints. The conclusion is that the use of Steady State OMPC with Laguerre functions improves feasibility and computation time. MPC can be used as a practical candidate controller for planetary precision landing scenarios. The tracking errors for PID, LQR and MPC control laws were less than 10 cm in the practical tests.	2012		0.375	1.3949999809265137	1	-0.6940000057220459
197	227170105	227170105	CPU Accelerator Co Scheduling for CNN Acceleration at the Edge	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely deployed for many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as object detection and image classification. Due to the burgeoning revolution in edge AI, CNN hardware accelerators are also being employed in resource constrained edge devices for achieving better performance and energy efficiency at the edge. Although CNN accelerators enable fast and energy efficient CNN inference at the edge, the remaining hardware resources on the edge devices except for the CNN accelerator remain idle, which could otherwise be utilized for attaining even better performance and energy efficiency for CNN inferences. In this paper, we propose a CPU accelerator co scheduling technique for convolution (CONV) layer operations of CNN inferences in resource constrained edge devices. Our proposed co scheduling technique exploits an inherent parallelism in CNN output channels, that is, the operations for generating different output channels in a CONV layer can be executed in parallel. For load balancing between the CPU and the CNN accelerator, we also propose a simple, yet accurate latency model for CONV layer operations in the CPU and the accelerator. Based on the latency estimation of CONV layer operations provided by our proposed model, we distribute the tasks to the CPU and the CNN accelerator in a load balance manner to minimize the idle period during the CONV layer operations in both the CPU and the CNN accelerator. We implement our proposed hardware/software (HW/SW) co scheduling technique in various field programmable gate array system on chip (FPGA SoC) platforms as a proof of concept. Experimental results indicate that our proposed co scheduling technique improves system performance by $1.18\times 2.00\times with energy reduction of 14.9% 49.7% as compared to the accelerator only execution.	2020	IEEE Access	0.875	3.255000114440918	3	-0.2070000022649765
