Reducing voltage supply and power consumption of integrated circuits is crucial factor since in general it ensures the device reliability, prevents overheating of the circuits and in particular prolongs the operation period for battery powered devices. Recently, non-conventional techniques i.e. bulkdriven (BD), floating-gate (FG) and quasi-floating-gate (QFG) techniques have been proposed as powerful ways to reduce the design complexity and push the voltage supply towards threshold voltage of the MOS transistors (MOST). Therefore, this paper presents the operation principle, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these techniques, enabling circuit designers to choose the proper design technique based on application requirements. As an example of application three operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA) based on these non-conventional techniques are presented, the voltage supply is only ±0.4 V and the power consumption is 23.5 μW. PSpice simulation results using the 0.18 μm CMOS technology from TSMC are included to verify the design functionality and correspondence with theory.

The system utilizes a gimbal-less two-axis micromirror scanner for high-speed laser beam-steering in both axes. The optical scan angle of the micromirrors is up to 16deg on each axis. A custom-designed fisheye lens is utilized to magnify scan angles. The system can display a variety of vector graphics as well as multiframe animations at arbitrary refresh rates, up to the overall bandwidth limit of the MEMS device. It is also possible to operate the scanners in point-to-point scanning, resonant and/or rastering modes. The system is highly adaptable for projection on a variety of surfaces including projection on specially coated transparent surfaces (Fig. 3.) The size of the displayed area, refresh rate, display mode (vector graphic or image raster,) and many other parameters are all adjustable by the user. The small size of the MEMS devices and lens as well as the ultra-low power consumption of the MEMS devices, in the milliwatt range, makes the overall system highly portable and miniaturizable.

In VIKOR linear normalization and in TOPSIS vector normalization is used to eliminate the units of criterion functions. The VIKOR method of compromise ranking determines a compromise solution, providing a maximum â€œgroup utilityâ€​ for the â€œmajorityâ€​ and a minimum of an individual regret for the â€œopponentâ€​. The TOPSIS method determines a solution with the shortest distance to the ideal solution and the greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution, but it does not consider the relative importance of these distances. A comparative analysis of these two methods is illustrated with a numerical example, showing their similarity and some differences. a, 1 b Purchase Export Previous article Next article Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.

However, findings are often inconsistent, thus challenging traditional neurocircuitry models of PTSD. As evidence mounts that cognition and behavior is an emergent property of interacting brain networks, the question arises whether PTSD can be understood by examining dysfunction in large-scale, spatially distributed neural networks. We used the activation likelihood estimation quantitative meta-analytic technique to synthesize findings across functional neuroimaging studies of PTSD that either used a non-trauma (N=20) or trauma-exposed (N=19) comparison control group. In line with neurocircuitry models, our findings support hyperactive amygdala and hypoactive medial prefrontal regions, but suggest hyperactive hippocampi. Characterization of additional regions under a triple network model showed functional alterations that largely overlapped with the salience network, central executive network, and default network. However, heterogeneity was observed within and across the neurocircuitry and triple network models, and between results based on comparisons to non-trauma and trauma-exposed control groups. Nonetheless, these results warrant further exploration of the neurocircuitry and large-scale network models in PTSD using connectivity analyses.

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image.

This paper describes a question answering system that is designed to capitalize on the tremendous amount of data that is now available online. Most question answering systems use a wide variety of linguistic resources. We focus instead on the redundancy available in large corpora as an important resource. We use this redundancy to simplify the query rewrites that we need to use, and to support answer mining from returned snippets. Our system performs quite well given the simplicity of the techniques being utilized. Experimental results show that question answering accuracy can be greatly improved by analyzing more and more matching passages. Simple passage ranking and n-gram extraction techniques work well in our system making it efficient to use with many backend retrieval engines.

Unlike most efforts in computer vision, our work proposes a Bayesian approach to object recognition in video, using a hierarchical, distributed architecture of dynamic processing elements that learns in a self-organizing way to cluster objects in the video input. A biologically inspired innovation is to implement a top-down pathway across layers in the form of causes, creating effectively a bidirectional processing architecture with feedback. To simplify discrimination, overcomplete representations are utilized. Both inference and parameter learning are performed using empirical priors, while imposing appropriate sparseness constraints. Preliminary results show that the cognitive architecture has features that resemble the functional organization of the early visual cortex. One example showing the use of top-down connections is given to disambiguate a synthetic video from correlated noise.

The anatomical structure of cerebellum is distinct with a three-layered cortex. During development, neurogenesis and fate decisions of cerebellar primordium cells are orchestrated through tightly controlled molecular events involving multiple genetic pathways. In this review, we will highlight the anatomical structure of human and mouse cerebellum, the cellular composition of developing cerebellum, and the underlying gene expression programs involved in cell fate commitments in the cerebellum. A critical evaluation of the cell death literature suggests that apoptosis occurs in ~5% of cerebellar cells, most shortly after mitosis. Apoptosis and cellular autophagy likely play significant roles in cerebellar development, we provide a comprehensive discussion of their role in cerebellar development and organization. We also address the possible function of unfolded protein response in regulation of cerebellar neurogenesis. We discuss recent advancements in understanding the epigenetic signature of cerebellar compartments and possible connections between DNA methylation, microRNAs and cerebellar neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss genetic diseases associated with cerebellar dysfunction and their role in the aging cerebellum.

This design employs longitudinal slots inserted into a substrate-integrated waveguide for operation in the mm-wave V-band. It is optimized for a reduced open-stopband and linear through broadside beam steering. The base design is outlined and adapted for three high frequency laminates with different dielectric constants. It is further described how the dielectric constant directly affects the beam steering properties of the LWA and how to scale the achieved beam angle for the given design by only changing the PCB material. The three LWA designs achieve beam steering from about 45° at Sr =2.2, over 60° at Sr =6.15 to 75° at Sr =10.2. The simulated radiation patterns show a flat gain of up to 18.0 dBi, 17.85 dBi and 15.27 dBi respectively. Furthermore, the effect of the modified PCB permittivity on the radiation efficiency as well as multiuser support with a beam per user is investigated.

To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display average ratings before accepting ratings from users which has been shown to bias ratings. This effect is called Social Inuence Bias (SIB); the tendency to conform to the perceived \norm"" in a community. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of SIB in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, we build a baseline dataset by allowing users to rate twice: before and after seeing the average rating. In the Analysis phase, we apply a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic to test whether the data is consistent with SIB. If significant, we propose a Mitigation phase using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict unbiased ratings. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 9390 ratings from the California Report Card (CRC), a rating-based system designed to encourage political engagement.

Previous Bayesian treatments of this problem define a prior over the number of hidden causes and use algorithms such as reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to move between solutions. In contrast, we assume that the number of hidden causes is unbounded, but only a finite number influence observable variables. This makes it possible to use a Gibbs sampler to approximate the distribution over causal structures. We evaluate the performance of both approaches in discovering hidden causes in simulated data, and use our non-parametric approach to discover hidden causes in a real medical dataset.

In the past two decades, CDPRs have been attracted a lot of attention since they have various advantages such as large workspace, low energy consumption, heavy payload capability and easy re-configurability. Especially, the greatest strength is that workspace can be expandable easily. CDPRs have enough large workspace inside an installed frame when the end-effector (EE) moves only translationally. However when the rotational motion of end-effector is used, the workspace is reduced substantially. To increase the workspace in the case that EE needs to rotate, there are two methods. One is to introduce a new mechanism of EE to change configuration parameters. Another is to change the cable configuration. In this paper, a cable configuration to increase the rotational workspace is proposed and analyzed. Using Wire Center software, workspaces were analyzed according to methods of cable connection. It is shown that the rotational workspace of the suspended 6-DOF CDPR is improved. This result is expected to influence the application expansion of CDPRs.

Detection progresses in a coarse-to-fine manner, first on a down-sampled version of the image and then on a sequence of higher resolution regions identified as likely to improve the detection accuracy. Built upon reinforcement learning, our approach consists of a model (R-net) that uses coarse detection results to predict the potential accuracy gain for analyzing a region at a higher resolution and another model (Q-net) that sequentially selects regions to zoom in. Experiments on the Caltech Pedestrians dataset show that our approach reduces the number of processed pixels by over 50% without a drop in detection accuracy. The merits of our approach become more significant on a high resolution test set collected from YFCC100M dataset, where our approach maintains high detection performance while reducing the number of processed pixels by about 70% and the detection time by over 50%.

For a robot attempting to learn to perform a sequential task with critical subgoal states, such states can provide a natural opportunity for interaction with a human expert. This paper analyzes the benefit of incorporating a notion of subgoals into Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) with a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) framework. The learning process is interactive, with a human expert first providing input in the form of full demonstrations along with some subgoal states. These subgoal states define a set of subtasks for the learning agent to complete in order to achieve the final goal. The learning agent queries for partial demonstrations corresponding to each subtask as needed when the agent struggles with the subtask. The proposed Human Interactive IRL (HI-IRL) framework is evaluated on several discrete path-planning tasks. We demonstrate that subgoal-based interactive structuring of the learning task results in significantly more efficient learning, requiring only a fraction of the demonstration data needed for learning the underlying reward function with the baseline IRL model.

Using an information transmission approach, we evaluate the performances of two such codes, one based on the spike count and the other on the mean interspike interval, and compare the results with a rank order code, where the first ganglion cells to emit a spike are given a maximal weight. Our results show that the rate codes are far from optimal for fast information transmission and that the temporal structure of the spike train can be efficiently used to maximize the information transfer rate under conditions where each cell needs to fire only one spike.

Control design methods based on the MPC concept have found wide acceptance in industrial applications and have been studied by academia. The reason for such popularity is the ability of MPC designs to yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention for long periods of time. In this paper the issues of importance that any control system should address are stated. MPC techniques are then reviewed in the light of these issues in order to point out their advantages in design and implementation. A number of design techniques emanating from MPC, namely Dynamic Matrix Control, Model Algorithmic Control, Inferential Control and Internal Model Control, are put in perspective with respect to each other and the relation to more traditional methods like Linear Quadratic Control is examined. The flexible constraint handling capabilities of MPC are shown to be a significant advantage in the context of the overall operating objectives of the process industries and the 1-, 2-, and oo-norm formulations of the performance objective are discussed. The application of MPC to non-linear systems is examined and it is shown that its main attractions carry over. Finally, it is explained that though MPC is not inherently more or less robust than classical feedback, it can be adjusted more easily for robustness.

Defect prediction models can be developed using software metrics in combination with defect data for predicting defective classes. Various studies have been conducted to find the relationship between software metrics and defect proneness, but there are few studies that statistically determine the effectiveness of the results. Objective: The main objectives of the study are (i) comparison of the machine-learning techniques using data sets obtained from popular open source software (ii) use of appropriate performance measures for measuring the performance of defect prediction models (iii) use of statistical tests for effective comparison of machine-learning techniques and (iv) validation of models over different releases of data sets. Method: In this study we use object-oriented metrics for predicting defective classes using 18 machinelearning techniques. The proposed framework has been applied to seven application packages of well known, widely used Android operating system viz. Contact, MMS, Bluetooth, Email, Calendar, Gallery2 and Telephony. The results are validated using 10-fold and inter-release validation methods. The reliability and significance of the results are evaluated using statistical test and post-hoc analysis. Results: The results show that the area under the curve measure for Naïve Bayes, LogitBoost and Multilayer Perceptron is above 0.7 in most of the cases. The results also depict that the difference between the ML techniques is statistically significant. However, it is also proved that the Support Vector Machines based techniques such as Support Vector Machines and voted perceptron do not possess the predictive capability for predicting defects. Conclusion: The results confirm the predictive capability of various ML techniques for developing defect prediction models. The results also confirm the superiority of one ML technique over the other ML techniques. Thus, the software engineers can use the results obtained from this study in the early phases of the software development for identifying defect-prone classes of given software. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Warm-ups are typically composed of a submaximal aerobic activity, stretching and a sport-specific activity. The stretching portion traditionally incorporated static stretching. However, there are a myriad of studies demonstrating static stretch-induced performance impairments. More recently, there are a substantial number of articles with no detrimental effects associated with prior static stretching. The lack of impairment may be related to a number of factors. These include static stretching that is of short duration (<90 s total) with a stretch intensity less than the point of discomfort. Other factors include the type of performance test measured and implemented on an elite athletic or trained middle aged population. Static stretching may actually provide benefits in some cases such as slower velocity eccentric contractions, and contractions of a more prolonged duration or stretch-shortening cycle. Dynamic stretching has been shown to either have no effect or may augment subsequent performance, especially if the duration of the dynamic stretching is prolonged. Static stretching used in a separate training session can provide health related range of motion benefits. Generally, a warm-up to minimize impairments and enhance performance should be composed of a submaximal intensity aerobic activity followed by large amplitude dynamic stretching and then completed with sport-specific dynamic activities. Sports that necessitate a high degree of static flexibility should use short duration static stretches with lower intensity stretches in a trained population to minimize the possibilities of impairments.

The relative impact of short, high-intensity training versus longer, slower distance training has been studied and debated for decades among athletes, coaches, and scientists. Currently, the popularity pendulum has swung towards high-intensity interval training. Many fitness experts, as well as some scientists, now argue that brief, high-intensity interval work is the only form of training necessary for performance optimization. Research on the impact of interval and continuous training with untrained to moderately trained subjects does not support the current interval craze, but the evidence does suggest that short intense training bouts and longer continuous exercise sessions should both be a part of effective endurance training. Elite endurance athletes perform 80 % or more of their training at intensities clearly below their lactate threshold and use high-intensity training surprisingly sparingly. Studies involving intensification of training in already well-trained athletes have shown equivocal results at best. The available evidence suggests that combining large volumes of low-intensity training with careful use of high-intensity interval training throughout the annual training cycle is the best-practice model for development of endurance performance.

An off-centered dielectric resonator instead of a traditional corner cuts perturbation or screws perturbation properly perturbs the two degenerate modes in the same cavity. Extensive study is then conducted to design this proposed diplexer. Finally, a diplexer prototype is fabricated using a brass cavity and it is tested for experimental verification of the predicted results.

In particular, the recently proposed attention models (Rocktäschel et al., 2015; Wang and Jiang, 2015) achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by computing soft word alignments between the premise and hypothesis sentences. However, there remains a major limitation: this line of work completely ignores syntax and recursion, which is helpful in many traditional efforts. We show that it is beneficial to extend the attention model to tree nodes between premise and hypothesis. More importantly, this subtree-level attention reveals information about entailment relation. We study the recursive composition of this subtree-level entailment relation, which can be viewed as a soft version of the Natural Logic framework (MacCartney and Manning, 2009). Experiments show that our structured attention and entailment composition model can correctly identify and infer entailment relations from the bottom up, and bring significant improvements in accuracy.

This hinders our ability to provide design metrics, processes and training that support inherent design work. By interviewing 25 software designers and using content analysis and explanation building as our analysis technique, we provide qualitative and quantitative results that highlight aspects of rational and naturalistic decision making in software design. Our qualitative multi-case study results in a model of design decision making to answer the question: how do software designers make design decisions? We find the structure of the design problem determines the aspects of rational and naturalistic decision making used. The more structured the design decision, the less a designer considers options. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The lay media and scientific literature have focused increasing attention on vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in recent years. Low vitamin D levels confer increased an risk of abnormal bone mineralization, and are linked to poor bone health in epilepsy patients. However, vitamin D is not the only determinant of bone health in children with epilepsy. Anticonvulsant medications, in addition to features and comorbidities of epilepsy and coexisting neurologic diseases, are important factors in this complex topic. We review the basic metabolism of vitamin D in terms of bone health among children with epilepsy. We also discuss the literature regarding vitamin D and bone mineral density in this population. Finally, we suggest algorithms for screening and treating vitamin D insufficiency in these patients.

We are the first to tackle this problem by providing active rule support embedded directly within the CEP engine, henceforth called Active Complex Event Processing technology, or short, Active CEP. We design the Active CEP model and associated rule language that allows rules to be triggered by CEP system state changes and correctly executed during the continuous query process. Moreover we design an Active CEP infrastructure, that integrates the active rule component into the CEP kernel, allowing finegrained and optimized rule processing. We demonstrate the power of Active CEP by applying it to the development of a collaborative project with UMass Medical School, which detects potential threads of infection and reminds healthcare workers to perform hygiene precautions in real-time. 1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION Complex patterns of events often capture exceptions, threats or opportunities occurring across application space and time. Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology has thus increasingly gained popularity for efficiently detecting such event patterns in real-time. For example CEP has been employed by diverse applications ranging from healthcare systems , financial analysis , real-time business intelligence to RFID based surveillance. However, existing CEP technologies [3, 7, 2, 5], while effective for pattern matching, are limited in their capability of supporting active rules. We motivate the need for such capability based on our experience with the development of a real-world hospital infection control system, called HygieneReminder, or short HyReminder. Application: HyReminder.

HyReminder is a collaborated project between WPI and University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) that uses advanced CEP technologies to solve this long-standing public health problem. HyReminder system aims to continuously track healthcare workers (HCW) for hygiene compliance (for example cleansing hands before entering a H1N1 patient’s room), and remind the HCW at the appropriate moments to perform hygiene precautions thus preventing spread of infections. CEP technologies are adopted to efficiently monitor event patterns, such as the sequence that a HCW left a patient room (this behavior is measured by a sensor reading and modeled as “exit” event), did not sanitize his hands (referred as “!sanitize”, where ! represents negation), and then entered another patient’s room (referred as “enter”). Such a sequence of behaviors, i.e. SEQ(exit,!sanitize,enter), would be deemed as a violation of hand hygiene regulations. Besides detecting complex events, the HyReminder system requires the ability to specify logic rules reminding HCWs to perform the respective appropriate hygiene upon detection of an imminent hand hygiene violation or an actual observed violation. A condensed version of example logic rules derived from HyReminder and modeled using CEP semantics is depicted in Figure 1. In the figure, the edge marked “Q1.1” expresses the logic that “if query Q1.1 is satisfied for a HCW, then change his hygiene status to warning and change his badge light to yellow”. This logic rule in fact specifies how the system should react to the observed change, here meaning the risk being detected by the continuous pattern matching query Q1.1, during the long running query process. The system’s streaming environment requires that such reactions be executed in a timely fashion. An additional complication arises in that the HCW status changed by this logic rule must be used as a condition by other continuous queries at run time, like Q2.1 and Q2.2. We can see that active rules and continuous queries over streaming data are tightly-coupled: continuous queries are monitoring the world while active rules are changing the world, both in real-time. Yet contrary to traditional databases, data is not persistently stored in a DSMS, but rather streamed through the system in fluctuating arrival rate. Thus processing active rules in CEP systems requires precise synchronization between queries and rules and careful consideration of latency and resource utilization. Limitations of Existing CEP Technology. In summary, the following active functionalities are needed by many event stream applications, but not supported by the existing	['49370659', '1715020', '3330321', '40465036']	[]	['7dafb6023792030d64b2119f6c6bb16def57e309', 'ac853fee48dd655536f1fab285d95427de34de6d', '74431138a3c85afb0d5e7cf653007137dffec070', '291c9e85ff878659ed35b607a8177d4ba30bc009', '412e79b701a05fc52b707dcb1851e9d111e8875e', 'd565b36197a6f978bc22df47a8ece903cc8d2f77', '0c504d0c8319802c9f63eeea0d7b437cded2f4ef']	2010.0

An important requirement for such techniques is to ensure anonymization of data while at the same time minimizing the information loss resulting from data modifications such as generalization and suppression. Current solutions, however, suffer from one or more of the following limitations: reliance on pre-defined generalization hierarchies; generation of anonymized data with high information loss and with high classification errors; and the inference channel arising from lack of diversity in the sensitive information. In this paper we propose an approach that addresses these limitations. Our approach uses the idea of clustering to minimize information loss and thus ensure good data quality. The key observation here is that data records that are naturally close with respect to each other should be part of the same equivalence class. Current clustering techniques, however, are not directly applicable in this context because they do not consider the requirement that each cluster should contain at least k records. We thus formulate a specific clustering problem, referred to as k-member clustering problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present a greedy algorithm, the complexity of which is in O(n). As part of our approach we develop a suitable metric to estimate the information loss introduced by generalizations, which works for both numeric and categorical data. We also present extensions to our proposed algorithm that minimize classification errors in the anonymized data and eliminate the inference channel arising from lack of diversity in the sensitive attributes. We experimentally compare our algorithm with two recently proposed algorithms. The experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms with respect to information loss, classification errors, and diversity.

To make offloading effective, the radio and computational resources need to be dynamically managed, to cope with the time-varying computation demands and wireless fading channels. In this paper, we develop an online joint radio and computational resource management algorithm for multi-user MEC systems, with the objective of minimizing the long-term average weighted sum power consumption of the mobile devices and the MEC server, subject to a task buffer stability constraint. Specifically, at each time slot, the optimal CPU-cycle frequencies of the mobile devices are obtained in closed forms, and the optimal transmit power and bandwidth allocation for computation offloading are determined with the Gauss-Seidel method; while for the MEC server, both the optimal frequencies of the CPU cores and the optimal MEC server scheduling decision are derived in closed forms. Besides, a delay-improved mechanism is proposed to reduce the execution delay. Rigorous performance analysis is conducted for the proposed algorithm and its delay-improved version, indicating that the weighted sum power consumption and execution delay obey an  $\left [{O\left ({1 / V}\right), O\left ({V}\right) }\right ]$  tradeoff with  $V$  as a control parameter. Simulation results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impacts of various parameters.

Why is she failing academically? Why is he so generous? Why is she so conscientious? Answers to such everyday questions--social explanations--have powerful effects on relationships at the interpersonal and societal levels. How do people select an explanation in particular cases? We suggest that, often, explanations are selected based on the individual's pre-existing general theories of social causality. More specifically, we suggest that over time individuals develop general beliefs regarding the causes of social events. We refer to these beliefs as social explanatory styles. Our goal in the present article is to offer and validate a measure of individual differences in social explanatory styles. Accordingly, we offer the Social Explanatory Styles Questionnaire (SESQ), which measures three independent dimensions of social explanatory style: Dispositionism, historicism, and controllability. Studies 1-3 examine basic psychometric properties of the SESQ and provide positive evidence regarding internal consistency, factor structure, and both convergent and divergent validity. Studies 4-6 examine predictive validity for each subscale: Does each explanatory dimension moderate an important phenomenon of social cognition? Results suggest that they do. In Study 4, we show that SESQ dispositionism moderates the tendency to make spontaneous trait inferences. In Study 5, we show that SESQ historicism moderates the tendency to commit the Fundamental Attribution Error. Finally, in Study 6 we show that SESQ controllability predicts polarization of moral blame judgments: Heightened blaming toward controllable stigmas (assimilation), and attenuated blaming toward uncontrollable stigmas (contrast). Decades of research suggest that explanatory style regarding the self is a powerful predictor of self-functioning. We think it is likely that social explanatory styles--perhaps comprising interactive combinations of the basic dimensions tapped by the SESQ--will be similarly potent predictors of social functioning. We hope the SESQ will be a useful tool for exploring that possibility.

Few studies have used laboratory paradigms to examine stress reactivity in bipolar disorder, and none have assessed autonomic reactivity to laboratory stressors. In the present investigation we sought to address this gap in the literature. Participants, 27 diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and 24 controls with no history of mood disorder, were asked to complete a complex working memory task presented as ""a test of general intelligence."" Self-reported emotions were assessed at baseline and after participants were given task instructions; autonomic physiology was assessed at baseline and continuously during the stressor task. Compared to controls, individuals with bipolar disorder reported greater increases in pretask anxiety from baseline and showed greater cardiovascular threat reactivity during the task. Group differences in cardiovascular threat reactivity were significantly correlated with comorbid anxiety in the bipolar group. Our results suggest that a multimethod approach to assessing stress reactivity-including the use of physiological parameters that differentiate between maladaptive and adaptive profiles of stress responding-can yield valuable information regarding stress sensitivity and its associations with negative affectivity in bipolar disorder.

We often rely on metrics of scholarly authority to find the prominent authors but these authority indices do not differentiate authority based on research topics. We present Latent Topical-Authority Indexing (LTAI) for jointly modeling the topics, citations, and topical authority in a corpus of academic papers. Compared to previous models, LTAI differs in two main aspects. First, it explicitly models the generative process of the citations, rather than treating the citations as given. Second, it models each author’s influence on citations of a paper based on the topics of the cited papers, as well as the citing papers. We fit LTAI into four academic corpora: CORA, Arxiv Physics, PNAS, and Citeseer. We compare the performance of LTAI against various baselines, starting with the latent Dirichlet allocation, to the more advanced models including author-link topic model and dynamic author citation topic model. The results show that LTAI achieves improved accuracy over other similar models when predicting words, citations and authors of publications.

Nagging exploits the speedup anomaly often observed when parallelizing problems by playing multiple reformulations of the problem or portions of the problem against each other. Nagging is both fault tolerant and robust to long message latencies. In this paper, we show how nagging can be used to parallelize several different algorithms drawn from the artificial intelligence literature, and describe how nagging can be combined with partitioning, the more traditional search parallelization strategy. We present a theoretical analysis of the advantage of nagging with respect to partitioning, and give empirical results obtained on a cluster of 64 processors that demonstrate nagging’s effectiveness and scalability as applied to A* search, α β minimax game tree search, and the Davis-Putnam algorithm.

To adapt a questionnaire in the Persian language measuring working conditions and health problems among nursing personnel. A further aim was to test the validity and reliability of the questionnaire.


METHODS
The adapted questionnaire was based on three well-established questionnaires. Physical working conditions items were from Nurse Early Exit Study. Psychosocial working conditions scales were included from Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire which contains two scales on general and mental health as well. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was the origin of the musculoskeletal disorders questions. During the culture adaptation process, an expert panel method was used. To achieve equivalence between the sources and target version, some changes were made by the expert panel. Then the questionnaire was examined in the field for face validity and construct validity (n = 92) among Iranian nursing personnel from two hospitals. Construct validity was assessed using a priori hypothesized correlations of the outcomes with exposures. Finally the adaptation process was completed by reliability assessment using Cronbach's alpha and Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC).


RESULTS
The construct validity result was the correlation of the health outcome with the work-related exposure (physical rs = .71 and psychosocial rs = .66). In the reliability assessment, Cronbach's alpha and ICC were .60 and .70 respectively.


CONCLUSION
The findings show that the adapted questionnaire has an acceptable conceptual structure and provides reliable information from the nursing profession. Consequently, the questionnaire is applicable to work situation studies among nurses and other health care workers."

There does not exist a robust method to estimate the wetted surface area (WSA) of a particular fleet of ships, especially across the diversity of possible vessel types. An estimate of the total WSA of ship arrivals into a port or region is essential to determine the potential scope of biofouling and to inform management strategies to reduce the future invasions. Multiple statistical models were developed so commonly available ships’ parameters could be used to estimate the WSA for a given set of fleet data. Using individual ship characteristics and publicly available data from  ~120,000 active commercial ships in the world fleet, the method results in a total global minimum WSA estimate of approximately 325 × 106 m2. The size of the global fleet employed here is greater than the commonly cited vessel number of approximately 80,000–90,000, as we include ships <100 gross tons. Over 190,000 vessels were initially identified, representing a WSA of 571 × 106 m2, but active status of only 120,000 vessels could be confirmed. Reliable data were unavailable on the operating status of many additional and especially smaller vessels. This approach, along with a contemporary and comprehensive estimate of global WSA, when combined with knowledge of the different operational profiles of ships that may reduce biofouling (port residence times, steaming speeds, extent of antifouling coatings, cleaning frequency, etc.), can inform current numerical models and risk assessments of bioinvasions.

Each input’s latent representation is predicted conditional on the observed data using a feature-rich conditional random field (CRF). Then a reconstruction of the input is (re)generated, conditional on the latent structure, using a generative model which factorizes similarly to the CRF. The autoencoder formulation enables efficient exact inference without resorting to unrealistic independence assumptions or restricting the kinds of features that can be used. We illustrate connections to traditional autoencoders, posterior regularization, and multi-view learning. We then show competitive results with instantiations of the framework for two canonical tasks in natural language processing: part-of-speech induction and bitext word alignment, and show that training the proposed model can be substantially more efficient than a comparable feature-rich baseline.

In some situations, designers are not willing to squander computing resources for the sake of programmer convenience. This is particularly true when the target machine is a programmable DSP chip. However, the runtime overhead inherent in most LGDF implementations is not required for most signal processing systems because such systems are mostly synchronous (in the DSP sense). Synchronous data flow (SDF) differs from traditional data flow in that the amount of data produced and consumed by a data flow node is specified a priori for each input and output. This is equivalent to specifying the relative sample rates in signal processing system. This means that the scheduling of SDF nodes need not be done at runtime, but can be done at compile time (statically), so the runtime overhead evaporates. The sample rates can all be different, which is not true of most current data-driven digital signal processing programming methodologies. Synchronous data flow is closely related to computation graphs, a special case of Petri nets. This self-contained paper develops the theory necessary to statically schedule SDF programs on single or multiple processors. A class of static (compile time) scheduling algorithms is proven valid, and specific algorithms are given for scheduling SDF systems onto single or multiple processors.

Our target here is ""Big Data"" processing on commodity clusters (mostly sparse power-law data). Allreduce can be used to synchronize models, to maintain distributed datasets, and to perform operations on distributed data such as sparse matrix multiply. We first review a key constraint on cluster communication, the minimum efficient packet size, which hampers the use of direct all-to-all protocols on large networks. Our allreduce network is a nested, heterogeneous-degree butterfly. We show that communication volume in lower layers is typically much less than the top layer, and total communication across all layers a small constant larger than the top layer, which is close to optimal. A chart of network communication volume across layers has a characteristic ""Kylix"" shape, which gives the method its name. For optimum performance, the butterfly degrees also decrease down the layers. Furthermore, to efficiently route sparse updates to the nodes that need them, the network must be nested. While the approach is amenable to various kinds of sparse data, almost all ""Big Data"" sets show power-law statistics, and from the properties of these, we derive methods for optimal network design. Finally, we present experiments showing with Kylix on Amazon EC2 and demonstrating significant improvements over existing systems such as PowerGraph and Hadoop."

Based on this abstraction, we present a new index, the c-index, in which the evaluated objects are the citations received by an author, a group of authors, a journal, etc., the quality function of a citation is the collaboration distance between the authors of the cited and the citing papers, and the sentencing line can take slopes between 0 and ∞. As a result, the new index counts only those citations which are significant enough, where significance is proportional to collaboration distance. Several advantages of the new c-index with respect to previous proposals are discussed.

This paper studies the potential of an augmented reality environment for the purpose of collaborative analysis of multidimensional, abstract data. We present ART, a collaborative analysis tool to visualize multidimensional data in augmented reality using an interactive, 3D parallel coordinates visualization. The visualization is anchored to a touch-sensitive tabletop, benefiting from well-established interaction techniques. The results of group-based, expert walkthroughs show that ART can facilitate immersion in the data, a fluid analysis process, and collaboration. Based on the results, we provide a set of guidelines and discuss future research areas to foster the development of immersive technologies as tools for the collaborative analysis of multidimensional data.

For machine learning algorithms, they usually require a lot of data to train a deep neural network to solve the problem. However, it is challenging for the existing systems to generalize well to the few-shot multi-modal scenario, because the learner should understand not only images and texts but also their relationships from only a few examples. In this paper, we tackle two multi-modal problems, i.e., image captioning and visual question answering (VQA), in the few-shot setting.
 We propose Fast Parameter Adaptation for Image-Text Modeling (FPAIT) that learns to learn jointly understanding image and text data by a few examples. In practice, FPAIT has two benefits. (1) Fast learning ability. FPAIT learns proper initial parameters for the joint image-text learner from a large number of different tasks. When a new task comes, FPAIT can use a small number of gradient steps to achieve a good performance. (2) Robust to few examples. In few-shot tasks, the small training data will introduce large biases in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and damage the learner's performance. FPAIT leverages dynamic linear transformations to alleviate the side effects of the small training set. In this way, FPAIT flexibly normalizes the features and thus reduces the biases during training. Quantitatively, FPAIT achieves superior performance on both few-shot image captioning and VQA benchmarks."

This paper presents a simple model that learns to compute word embeddings by processing dictionary definitions and trying to reconstruct them. It exploits the inherent recursivity of dictionaries by encouraging consistency between the representations it uses as inputs and the representations it produces as outputs. The resulting embeddings are shown to capture semantic similarity better than regular distributional methods and other dictionary-based methods. In addition, the method shows strong performance when trained exclusively on dictionary data and generalizes in one shot.

There exists a strong link between ADHD and academic underachievement. Both the core behavioral symptoms of ADHD and associated executive functioning deficits likely contribute to academic impairment. Current evidence-based approaches to the treatment of ADHD (i.e., stimulant medication, clinical behavior therapy and classroom behavioral interventions) have demonstrated a robust impact on behavioral variables such as attention and disruptive behavior within classroom analogue settings; however, their efficacy in improving academic outcomes is much less clear. Although surprisingly few treatment outcome studies of ADHD have attempted to incorporate interventions that specifically target academic outcomes, the studies that are available suggest that these interventions may be beneficial. The state of the treatment literature for addressing academic impairment in children and adolescents with ADHD will be reviewed herein, as well as limitations of current research, and directions for future research.

Recently, most progress in this field has come from training very deep neural networks on massive datasets which is computationally intensive and time consuming. Here, we propose a deep transfer learning (DTL) approach that integrates transfer learning techniques and convolutional neural networks and apply it to the problem of facial recognition to fine-tune facial recognition models. Transfer learning can allow for the training of robust, high-performance machine learning models that require much less time and resources to produce than similarly performing models that have been trained from scratch. Using a pre-trained face recognition model, we were able to perform transfer learning to produce a network that is capable of making accurate predictions on much smaller datasets. We also compare our results with results produced by a selection of classical algorithms on the same datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DTL approach.

Starch and lipids are key components of algal cells and responsible for buffering variable supplies of energy and carbon that are vital for cell growth and reproduction, particularly DNA replication, nuclear and cellular division. The basic characteristics of energy reserves, their ultrastructure and localization inside the cell, regulation of their synthesis in relation to cell cycle phases, and their control by external factors, including light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide are described. Over the last two decades, research in this field has been boosted by possible biotechnological applications of algae for the production of biofuels from energy conserving compounds (bioethanol from starch and biodiesel from lipids). Recent findings on mechanisms that lead to an accumulation of exceptionally high levels of starch and lipids in algae will be summarized in this review. Macroelement (N, S, P) limitation, or depletion in mineral medium, as the most widely used approaches for enhancing both starch and lipid accumulation, are reviewed in detail. Potential biotechnological strategies for the economically viable overproduction of lipid and starch, such as a two-step procedure exploiting the effects of nutrient limitation and depletion, as well as the means and rationale for selecting appropriate strains, are discussed.

Data-driven approaches to malware detection run the risk of becoming rapidly antiquated. Keeping pace with malware requires models that are periodically enriched with fresh knowledge, commonly known as retraining. In this work, we propose the use of Venn-Abers predictors for assessing the quality of binary classification tasks as a first step towards identifying antiquated models. One of the key benefits behind the use of Venn-Abers predictors is that they are automatically well calibrated and offer probabilistic guidance on the identification of nonstationary populations of malware. Our framework is agnostic to the underlying classification algorithm and can then be used for building better retraining strategies in the presence of concept drift. Results obtained over a timeline-based evaluation with about 90K samples show that our framework can identify when models tend to become obsolete.

The result of this test is obtained after a time period of about 45 days. The purpose of this study is to develop a data mining(DM) solution which makes diagnosis of tuberculosis as accurate as possible and helps deciding if it is reasonable to start tuberculosis treatment on suspected patients without waiting the exact medical test results or not. In this research, we proposed the use of Sugeno-type “adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system” (ANFIS) to predict the existence of mycobacterium tuberculosis. 667 different patient records which are obtained from a clinic are used in the entire process of this research. Each of the patient records consist of 30 separate input parameters. ANFIS model is generated by using 500 of those records. We also implemented a multilayer perceptron and PART model using the same data set. The ANFIS model classifies the instances with an RMSE of 18% whereas Multilayer Perceptron does the same classification with an RMSE of % 19 and PART algorithm with an RMSE of % 20. ANFIS is an accurate and reliable method when compared with Multilayer Perceptron and PART algorithms for classification of tuberculosis patients. This study has contribution on forecasting patients before the medical tests.

In particular, we perform group anomaly detection (GAD) with an emphasis on irregular group distributions (e.g. irregular mixtures of image pixels). GAD is an important task in detecting unusual and anomalous phenomena in real-world applications such as high energy particle physics, social media and medical imaging. In this paper, we take a generative approach by proposing deep generative models: Adversarial autoencoder (AAE) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for group anomaly detection. Both AAE and VAE detect group anomalies using point-wise input data where group memberships are known a priori. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our models on real world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust in detecting group anomalies.	['34900451', '40912192', '1756323']	[]	[]	2018.0

However, dense prediction problems such as semantic segmentation are structurally different from image classification. In this work, we develop a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed for dense prediction. The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multiscale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification networks to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can increase accuracy.

A log-structured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log into segments and use a segment cleaner to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. We present a series of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a prototype log-structured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes while matching or exceeding Unix performance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70% of the disk bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems typically can use only 5--10%.

Arguably one of the most important and interesting open research problems is that of data efficiency. Supervised machine learning models, and especially deep neural networks, are notoriously data hungry, often requiring millions of labeled examples to achieve desired performance. However, labeled data is often expensive or difficult to obtain, hindering advances in interesting and important domains. What avenues might we pursue to increase the data efficiency of machine learning models? One approach is semi-supervised learning. In contrast to labeled data, unlabeled data is often easy and inexpensive to obtain. Semi-supervised learning is concerned with leveraging unlabeled data to improve performance in supervised tasks. Another approach is active learning: in the presence of a labeling mechanism (oracle), how can we choose examples to be labeled in a way that maximizes the gain in performance? In this thesis we are concerned with developing models that enable us to improve data efficiency of powerful models by jointly pursuing both of these approaches. Deep generative models parameterized by neural networks have emerged recently as powerful and flexible tools for unsupervised learning. They are especially useful for modeling high-dimensional and complex data. We propose a deep generative model with a discriminative component. By including the discriminative component in the model, after training is complete the model is used for classification rather than variational approximations. The model further includes stochastic inputs of arbitrary dimension for increased flexibility and expressiveness. We leverage the stochastic layer to learn representations of the data which naturally accommodate semi-supervised learning. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure to marginalize the stochastic inputs while inferring labels. We extend the model to include uncertainty in the weights, allowing us to explicitly capture model uncertainty, and demonstrate how this allows us to use the model for active learning as well as semi-supervised learning.

Though increasingly effective, Machine Learning (ML) techniques generally do not go beyond classification of events with opaque labels, lacking machine-understandable representation and explanation of taxonomies. This paper proposes a framework for semantic-enhanced data mining on sensor streams, amenable to resource-constrained pervasive contexts. It merges an ontology-based characterization of data distributions with non-standard reasoning for a fine-grained event detection. The typical classification problem of ML is treated as a resource discovery by exploiting semantic matchmaking. Outputs of classification are endowed with computer-processable descriptions in standard Semantic Web languages, while explanation of matchmaking outcomes motivates confidence on results. A case study on road and traffic analysis has allowed to validate the proposal and achieve an assessment with respect to state-of-the-art ML algorithms.

This study hypothesized that their measurement via self-ratings is differentially biased by participants’ emotions. The relationship between habitual emotions and personality should be mirrored in a patterned influence of emotional states upon personality scores. Methods: We experimentally induced emotional states and compared baseline Big Five scores of ninety-eight German participants (67 female; mean age 22.2) to their scores after the induction of happiness or sadness. Manipulation checks included the induced emotion’s intensity and durability. Results: The expected differential effect could be detected for neuroticism and extraversion and as a trend for agreeableness. Post-hoc analyses showed that only sadness led to increased neuroticism and decreased extraversion scores. Oppositely, happiness did not decrease neuroticism, but there was a trend for an elevation on extraversion scores. Conclusion: Results suggest a specific effect of sadness on self-reported personality traits, particularly on neuroticism.

At the same time, content caching in wireless networks has become an essential solution to lower the content- access latency and backhaul traffic loading, leading to user QoE improvement and network cost reduction. In this article, a novel cooperative hierarchical caching (CHC) framework in C-RAN is introduced where contents are jointly cached at the BBU and at the RRHs. Unlike in traditional approaches, the cache at the BBU, cloud cache, presents a new layer in the cache hierarchy, bridging the latency/capacity gap between the traditional edge-based and core-based caching schemes. Trace-driven simulations reveal that CHC yields up to 51 percent improvement in cache hit ratio, 11 percent decrease in average content access latency, and 18 percent reduction in backhaul traffic load compared to the edge-only caching scheme with the same total cache capacity. Before closing the article, we discuss the key challenges and promising opportunities for deploying content caching in C-RAN in order to make it an enabler technology in 5G ultra-dense systems.

Lane detection is a crucial element of any driver assistance system. At present, researchers working on lane detection are confronted with several major challenges, such as attaining robustness to inconsistencies in lighting and background clutter. To address these issues in this work, we propose a method named Lane Detection with Two-stage Feature Extraction (LDTFE) to detect lanes, whereby each lane has two boundaries. To enhance robustness, we take lane boundary as collection of small line segments. In our approach, we apply a modified HT (Hough Transform) to extract small line segments of the lane contour, which are then divided into clusters by using the DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clustering algorithm. Then, we can identify the lanes by curve fitting. The experimental results demonstrate that our modified HT works better for LDTFE than LSD (Line Segment Detector). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method on the challenging dataset of road images compared with state-of-the-art lanedetection methods. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a model-based estimation method that utilizes pneumatic trail information in steering torque to identify a vehicle's lateral handling limits, which are defined by the tire slip angle and peak lateral force limits. This method uses measurements available on many current production vehicles. Most importantly, it takes advantage of the early friction information encoded in the tire pneumatic trail. Pneumatic trail decreases as a function of the tire parameters even in the linear handling region, enabling early detection of the limits before they are reached. Experimental results on an independent front steering steer-by-wire research vehicle demonstrate the observer's ability to provide accurate real-time estimates of tire slip angle up to the limits of handling. Testing conditions include maneuvers performed on dry, flat paved road, as well as on lower-friction, dry gravel.

The reason for such interest is the wide range of applications that the successful estimation of human pose offers. Articulated pose estimation includes real time acquisition, analysis, processing and understanding of high dimensional visual information. Ensemble learning methods operating on hand-engineered features have been commonly used for addressing this task. Deep learning exploits representation learning methods to learn multiple levels of representations from raw input data, alleviating the need to hand-crafted features. Deep convolutional neural networks are achieving the state-of-the-art in visual object recognition, localization, detection. In this paper, the pose estimation task is formulated as an offset joint regression problem. The 3D joints positions are accurately detected from a single raw depth image using a deep convolutional neural networks model. The presented method relies on the utilization of the state-of-the-art data generation pipeline to generate large, realistic, and highly varied synthetic set of training images. Analysis and experimental results demonstrate the generalization performance and the real time successful application of the proposed method.

Although JSON is a simple data exchange format, its querying is not always effective, especially in the case of large repositories of data. This work aims to integrate the JSONiq extension to the XQuery language specification into an existing query processor (Apache VXQuery) to enable it to query JSON data in parallel. VXQuery is built on top of Hyracks (a framework that generates parallel jobs) and Algebricks (a language-agnostic query algebra toolbox) and can process data on the fly, in contrast to other well-known systems which need to load data first. Thus, the extra cost of data loading is eliminated. In this paper, we implement three categories of rewrite rules which exploit the features of the above platforms to efficiently handle path expressions along with introducing intra-query parallelism. We evaluate our implementation using a large (803GB) dataset of sensor readings. Our results show that the proposed rewrite rules lead to efficient and scalable parallel processing of JSON data.

Modeling the gestures and skill level of surgeons presents an interesting problem. The insights drawn may be applied in effective skill acquisition, objective skill assessment, real-time feedback, and human–robot collaborative surgeries. We propose a solution to the tool detection and localization open problem in RAS video understanding, using a strictly computer vision approach and the recent advances of deep learning. We propose an architecture using multimodal convolutional neural networks for fast detection and localization of tools in RAS videos. To the best of our knowledge, this approach will be the first to incorporate deep neural networks for tool detection and localization in RAS videos. Our architecture applies a region proposal network (RPN) and a multimodal two stream convolutional network for object detection to jointly predict objectness and localization on a fusion of image and temporal motion cues. Our results with an average precision of 91% and a mean computation time of 0.1 s per test frame detection indicate that our study is superior to conventionally used methods for medical imaging while also emphasizing the benefits of using RPN for precision and efficiency. We also introduce a new data set, ATLAS Dione, for RAS video understanding. Our data set provides video data of ten surgeons from Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA, performing six different surgical tasks on the daVinci Surgical System (dVSS) with annotations of robotic tools per frame.

Inferring user interests is important for systems such as search and recommendation engines to provide information that is more attuned to the likes of its users. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model of user utterances that encapsulates both user and network information. This model captures the complex interactions between varied interests of the users, his level of activeness in the network, and the information propagation from the neighbors. As exact probabilistic inference in this model is intractable, we propose an online variational inference algorithm that also takes into account evolving social graph, user and his neighbors? interests. We prove the optimality of the online inference with respect to an equivalent batch update. We present experimental results performed on the actual Twitter users, validating our approach.

For many types of structured data, this upfront effort is unjustifiable, so the data are processed directly over the file system using the Hadoop framework, despite the cumulative performance benefits of processing this data in an analytical database system. In this paper we describe a system that achieves the immediate gratification of running MapReduce jobs directly over a file system, while still making progress towards the long-term performance benefits of database systems. The basic idea is to piggyback on MapReduce jobs, leverage their parsing and tuple extraction operations to incrementally load and organize tuples into a database system, while simultaneously processing the file system data.

The interesting fact about Sudoku is that it is a trivial puzzle to solve. The reason it is trivial to solve is that an algorithm exists for Sudoku solutions. The algorithm is a tree-based search algorithm based on backtracking in a tree until a solution is found. If all a person needs to do is sit down at their personal computer, punch in the numbers given in the puzzle, and then watch a computer program compute the solution, we can reasonably ask why a person would bother to struggle to solve Sudoku puzzles. The reason is that people enjoy struggling with pencil and paper to work out Sudoku solutions. Herzberg and Murty (2007, p. 716) give two reasons for the enjoyment of this struggle: First, it is sufficiently difficult to pose a serious mental challenge for anyone attempting to do the puzzle. Secondly, simply by scanning rows and columns, it is easy to enter the “missing colors”, and this gives the solver some encouragement to persist. This paper develops an algorithm for solving any Sudoku puzzle by pencil and paper, especially the ones classified as diabolical.	['47150143']	[]	['4087110a5adb3a42582d1808bee8721f738580b4']	2009.0

However, it is increasingly apparent that formulations containing natural and/or synthetic lipids present a viable means for enhancing the oral bioavailability of some poorly water-soluble, highly lipophilic drugs. This Review details the mechanisms by which lipids and lipidic excipients affect the oral absorption of lipophilic drugs and provides a perspective on the possible future applications of lipid-based delivery systems. Particular emphasis has been placed on the capacity of lipids to enhance drug solubilization in the intestinal milieu, recruit intestinal lymphatic drug transport (and thereby reduce first-pass drug metabolism) and alter enterocyte-based drug transport and disposition.

The work demonstrated in this paper shows results from simulations for building optimal fuzzy based algorithm for traffic splitting and congestion avoidance. The design and implementation of Fuzzy based software defined networking is illustrated by introducing the Fuzzy Traffic Monitor in an ingress node. Finally, it displays improvements in the terms of mean delay (42.0%) and mean loss rate (2.4%) for Video Traffic. Then, the resu1t shows an improvement in the terms of mean delay (5.4%) and mean loss rate (3.4%) for Data Traffic and an improvement in the terms of mean delay(44.9%) and mean loss rate(4.1%) for Voice Traffic as compared to default MPLS implementation.

Geometric objects are often represented by many millions of triangles or polygons, which limits the ease with which they can be transmitted and displayed electronically. This has led to the development of many algorithms for simplifying geometric models, and to the recognition that metrics are required to evaluate their success. The goal is to create computer graphic renderings of the object that do not appear to be degraded to a human observer. The perceptual evaluation of simplified objects is a new topic. One approach has been to use image-based metrics to predict the perceived degradation of simplified 3-D models 1 Since that 2-D images of 3-D objects can have significantly different perceived quality, depending on the direction of the illumination, 2 2-D measures of image quality may not adequately capture the perceived quality of 3-D objects. To address this question, we conducted experiments in which we explicitly compared the perceived quality of animated 3-D objects and their corresponding 2-D still image projections. Our results suggest that 2-D judgements do not provide a good predictor of 3-D image quality, and identify a need to develop “object quality metrics.”	['3112585', '1690595']	[]	['f09b8e5e5dd111d0f1e74ac1c30efbf3da261a13', '6a806bceb822e42d7d66babab732bc1583328b65', '1391fe979400db109d195fbbda13b2f155dc0acb', 'bd07834d731f8bcbe0866b41a0cb6eddfbbcbee8', '9a72d3203b93a9d00ed043e03c554710388bfd9f', '8c48e5468188961b95569f506982d656e52dfeaf']	2001.0

A short length of wire formed the antenna while a beam lead Schottky diode across a resonant loop formed the frequency doubler circuit yielding a total tag mass of less than 3 mg. Simulators using the method-of-moments for the antenna, finite-integral time-domain for the loop, and harmonic balance for the nonlinear diode element were used to predict and optimize the transceiver performance. This performance is compared to the ideal case and to measurements performed using a pulsed magnetron source within an anechoic chamber. A method for analysis of the tag is presented and used to optimize the design by creating the largest possible return signal at the second harmonic frequency for a particular incident power density. These methods were verified through measurement of tags both in isolation and mounted on insects. For excitation at 9.41 GHz the optimum tag in isolation had an antenna length of 12 mm with a loop diameter of 1 mm which yielded a harmonic cross-section of 40 mm/sup 2/. For tags mounted on Colorado potato beetles, optimum performance was achieved with an 8 mm dipole fed 2 mm from the beetle attached end. A theory is developed that describes harmonic radar in a fashion similar to the conventional radar range equation but with harmonic cross-section replacing the conventional radar cross-section. This method provides a straightforward description of harmonic radar system performance as well as provides a means to describe harmonic radar tag performance.

We seek to characterize, understand, and identify patterns centered around exchanges in the context of a directed hypergraph model for Bitcoin transactions. We introduce the idea of motifs in directed hypergraphs, considering a particular 2-motif as a potential laundering pattern. We identify distinct statistical properties of exchange addresses related to the acquisition and spending of bitcoin. We then leverage this to build classification models to learn a set of discriminating features, and are able to predict if an address is owned by an exchange with > 80% accuracy using purely structural features of the graph. Applying this classifier to the 2-motif patterns reveals a preponderance of interexchange activity, while not necessarily significant laundering patterns.

An important indicator of survival rates after an accident is the time between the accident and when emergency medical personnel are dispatched to the scene. Eliminating the time between when an accident occurs and when first responders are dispatched to the scene decreases mortality rates by 6%. One approach to eliminating the delay between accident occurrence and first responder dispatch is to use in-vehicle automatic accident detection and notification systems, which sense when traffic accidents occur and immediately notify emergency personnel. These in-vehicle systems, however, are not available in all cars and are expensive to retrofit for older vehicles. This paper describes how smartphones, such as the iPhone and Google Android platforms, can automatically detect traffic accidents using accelerometers and accoustic data, immediately notify a central emergency dispatch server after an accident, and provide situational awareness through photographs, GPS coordinates, VOIP communication channels, and accident data recording. This paper provides the following contributions to the study of detecting traffic accidents via smartphones: (1) we present a formal model for accident detection that combines sensors and context data, (2) we show how smartphone sensors, network connections, and web services can be used to provide situational awarenss to first responders, and (3) we provide empirical results demonstrating the efficacy of different approaches employed by smartphone accident detection systems to prevent false positives.

As deep learning has scaled up to more challenging tasks, the architectures have become difficult to design by hand. This paper proposes an automated method, CoDeepNEAT, for optimizing deep learning architectures through evolution. By extending existing neuroevolution methods to topology, components, and hyperparameters, this method achieves results comparable to best human designs in standard benchmarks in object recognition and language modeling. It also supports building a real-world application of automated image captioning on a magazine website.

SRT was applied to 12 eyes of Dutch Belted rabbits. Retinal changes were assessed based on fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FAG), SD-OCT, light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at each of the following time points: 1 h, and 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after SRT. BrdU (5’-bromo-2’-deoxy-uridine) incorporation assay was also conducted to evaluate potential proliferation of RPE cells. SRT lesions at1 h after SRT were ophthalmoscopically invisible. FAG showed leakage in areas corresponding to SRT lesions, and hyperfluorescence disappeared after 7 days. SD-OCT showed that decreased reflectivity corresponding to RPE damage was restored to normal over time in SRT lesions. Histologic analysis revealed that the damage in SRT lesions was primarily limited to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the outer segments of the photoreceptors. SEM and TEM showed RPE cell migration by day 3 after SRT, and restoration of the RPE monolayer with microvilli by 1 week after SRT. At 14 and 28 days, ultrastructures of the RPE, including the microvilli and tight junctions, were completely restored. The outer segments of the photoreceptors also recovered without sequelae. Interdigitation between the RPE and photoreceptors was observed. BrdU incorporation assay revealed proliferation of RPE on day 3 after SRT, and peak proliferation was observed on day 7 after SRT. Based on multimodal imaging and histologic assessment, our findings demonstrate that SRT with OFT could selectively target the RPE without damaging the neurosensory retina. Therefore, the use of SRT with OFT opens the door to the possibility of clinical trials of well-defined invisible and nondestructive retina therapy, especially for macular disease.

In this paper, we propose a new routing metric, the drain rate, which predicts the lifetime of a node as a function of current traffic conditions. We describe the Minimum Drain Rate (MDR) mechanism which uses a combination of the drain rate with remaining battery capacity to establish routes. MDR can be employed by any existing MANET routing protocol to achieve a dual goal: extend both nodal battery life and connection lifetime. Using the ns-2 simulator and the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol, we compared MDR to the Minimum Total Transmission Power Routing (MTPR) scheme and the Min-Max Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR) scheme and proved that MDR is the best approach to achieve the dual goal.

With technologies such as LIDAR, the information about the incoming wind field - the main disturbance to the system - can be made available ahead of time. Feedforward control can be easily combined with traditional collective pitch feedback controllers and has been successfully tested on real systems. Nonlinear model predictive controllers adjusting both collective pitch and generator torque can further reduce structural loads in simulations but have higher computational times compared to feedforward or linear model predictive controller. This paper compares a linear and a commercial nonlinear model predictive controller to a baseline controller. On the one hand simulations show that both controller have significant improvements if used along with the preview of the rotor effective wind speed. On the other hand the nonlinear model predictive controller can achieve better results compared to the linear model close to the rated wind speed.

First, we show how using TEEs for existing proof of work schemes can make mining equitably distributed by preventing the use of ASICs. Next, we extend the design with proof of time and proof of ownership consensus primitives to make mining energy- and time-efficient. Further improving on these designs, we present a blockchain using a proof of luck consensus protocol. Our proof of luck blockchain uses a TEE platform's random number generation to choose a consensus leader, which offers low-latency transaction validation, deterministic confirmation time, negligible energy consumption, and equitably distributed mining. Lastly, we discuss a potential protection against up to a constant number of compromised TEEs.

IoT smart objects need to be somehow identified to determine the origin of the data and to automatically detect the elements around us. One of the best positioned technologies to perform identification is RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), which in the last years has gained a lot of popularity in applications like access control, payment cards or logistics. Despite its popularity, RFID security has not been properly handled in numerous applications. To foster security in such applications, this article includes three main contributions. First, in order to establish the basics, a detailed review of the most common flaws found in RFID-based IoT systems is provided, including the latest attacks described in the literature. Second, a novel methodology that eases the detection and mitigation of such flaws is presented. Third, the latest RFID security tools are analyzed and the methodology proposed is applied through one of them (Proxmark 3) to validate it. Thus, the methodology is tested in different scenarios where tags are commonly used for identification. In such systems it was possible to clone transponders, extract information, and even emulate both tags and readers. Therefore, it is shown that the methodology proposed is useful for auditing security and reverse engineering RFID communications in IoT applications. It must be noted that, although this paper is aimed at fostering RFID communications security in IoT applications, the methodology can be applied to any RFID communications protocol.

This benchmark bridges the gap between the established single-workload suites of TPC-C for OLTP and TPC-H for OLAP, and executes a complex mixed workload: a transactional workload based on the order entry processing of TPC-C and a corresponding TPC-H-equivalent OLAP query suite run in parallel on the same tables in a single database system. As it is derived from these two most widely used TPC benchmarks, the CH-benCHmark produces results highly relevant to both hybrid and classic single-workload systems.

Sentiment analysis focuses on the analysis and understanding of the emotions from the text patterns. It identifies the opinion or attitude that a person has towards a topic or an object and it seeks to identify the viewpoint underlying a text span. Sentiment analysis is useful in social media monitoring to automatically characterize the overall feeling or mood of consumers as reflected in social media toward a specific brand or company and determine whether they are viewed positively or negatively on the web. This new form of analysis has been widely adopted in customer relation management especially in the context of complaint management. For automating the task of classifying a single topic textual review, document-level sentiment classification is used for expressing a positive or negative sentiment. So analyzing sentiment using Multi-theme document is very difficult and the accuracy in the classification is less. The document level classification approximately classifies the sentiment using Bag of words in Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In proposed work, a new algorithm called Sentiment Fuzzy Classification algorithm with parts of speech tags is used to improve the classification accuracy on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews dataset.

This paper concentrates on the benefits of recommending news items using a domain ontology instead of using a term-based approach. For this purpose, we propose Athena, which is an extension to the existing Hermes framework. Athena employs a user profile to store terms or concepts found in news items browsed by the user. Based on this information, the framework uses a traditional method based on TF-IDF, and several ontology-based methods to recommend new articles to the user. The paper concludes with the evaluation of the different methods, which shows that the new ontology-based method that we propose in this paper performs better (w.r.t. accuracy, precision, and recall) than the traditional method and, with the exception of one measure (recall), also better than the other considered ontology-based approaches.

We present a flexible approach that can deal with generic objects, both textured and texture-less. The key new concept is a learned, intermediate representation in form of a dense 3D object coordinate labelling paired with a dense class labelling. We are able to show that for a common dataset with texture-less objects, where template-based techniques are suitable and state-of-the art, our approach is slightly superior in terms of accuracy. We also demonstrate the benefits of our approach, compared to template-based techniques, in terms of robustness with respect to varying lighting conditions. Towards this end, we contribute a new ground truth dataset with 10k images of 20 objects captured each under three different lighting conditions. We demonstrate that our approach scales well with the number of objects and has capabilities to run fast.

By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top–down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.

The numeric results also indicate that the CCA (air China) is of a considerable higher value of maximal degree and betweenness than other top airlines.

Automatic creation of conceptual dictionaries is important for portability and scalability of an IE system. This paper describes CRYSTAL, a system which automatically induces a dictionary of \concept-node de nitions"" su cient to identify relevant information from a training corpus. Each of these concept-node de nitions is generalized as far as possible without producing errors, so that a minimum number of dictionary entries cover the positive training instances. Because it tests the accuracy of each proposed de nition, CRYSTAL can often surpass human intuitions in creating reliable extraction rules. 1 Information Extraction An information extraction (IE) system analyzes unrestricted natural language text and produces a representation of the information from the text which is considered relevant to a particular application. Information extracted from the text is represented as case frames, called \concept nodes"" (CN's) in the University of Massachusetts BADGER sentence analyzer, which performs selective concept extraction similar to that of the previous CIRCUS system [Lehnert, 1991; Lehnert et al., 1993]. The domain knowledge needed to identify relevant references is stored in a dictionary of \CN de nitions"" that describe the local syntactic and semantic context in which relevant information is likely to be found. Before the CN de nition is applied, BADGER segments the input text to identify syntactic constituents such as subject, verb phrase, direct and indirect object, and prepositional phrases, and also looks up the semantic class of each word in a domain-speci c semantic lexicon. A CN This research was supported by NSF Grant no. EEC9209623, State/ Industry/ University Cooperative Research on Intelligent Information Retrieval. Thanks also to David Aronow for help as our medical domain expert. de nition speci es a set of syntactic and semantic constraints that must be satis ed for the de nition to apply to a segment of text. Examples in this paper are from a medical domain, where the task is to analyze hospital discharge reports and identify references to \diagnosis"" and to \sign or symptom"". These are further classi ed with subtypes. Diagnosis: Sign or Symptom: con rmed present ruled out absent suspected presumed pre-existing unknown past history The example shown in Figure 1 is a CN de nition from this domain that identi es references to absent symptoms. This CN de nition extracts the phrase in the direct object bu er when the subject bu er has the word \patient"" (semantic class <Patient or Disabled Group>), the verb is \denies"" in the active voice, and the direct object has the semantic class <Sign or Symptom>."

In order to control the relative motion and the exchanged contact forces, the latter need to be estimated without using any local force sensing device. Building upon our recent works, we generalize the classical hybrid force/velocity control design to this situation, handling complementary quantities along the directions of a suitable contact task frame in a dynamically decoupled way. The contact force is estimated online using our residual method together with an external sensor to localize the contact point, and the time-varying contact task frame is obtained analytically from this estimate. Experimental results are presented for a KUKA LWR4 robot using a Kinect sensor.

Existing CNN-based objection detection pipeline faces such a dilemma: using a high-resolution image as input incurs high computational cost, but using a low-resolution image as input loses the feature representation of small objects and therefore leads to low accuracy. In this work, we propose a cascade mask generation framework to tackle this issue. The proposed framework takes in multi-scale images as input and processes them in ascending order of the scale. Each processing stage outputs object proposals as well as a region-of-interest (RoI) mask for the next stage. With RoI convolution, the masked regions can be excluded from the computation in the next stage. The procedure continues until the largest scale image is processed. Finally, the object proposals generated from multiple scales are classified by a post classifier. Extensive experiments on Tsinghua-Tencent 100K traffic sign benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art small object detection performance at a significantly improved speed-accuracy tradeoff compared with previous methods.

In our work we represent a system as a graph where hyperedges are components and nodes are ports of communication. The construction and dynamic evolut,ion of the style will be represented as context-free productions and graph rewriting. To model the evolution of the system we propose to use techniques of constraint solving. From this approach we obtain an intuitive way to model systems with nice characteristics for the description of dynamic architectures and reconfiguration and, a unique language to describe the style, model the evolution of the system and prove properties.

While, in a general sense, MIMO radar can be viewed as a type of multistatic radar, the separate nomenclature suggests unique features that set MIMO radar apart from the multistatic radar literature and that have a close relation to MIMO communications. This article reviews some recent work on MIMO radar with widely separated antennas. Widely separated transmit/receive antennas capture the spatial diversity of the target's radar cross section (RCS). Unique features of MIMO radar are explained and illustrated by examples. It is shown that with noncoherent processing, a target's RCS spatial variations can be exploited to obtain a diversity gain for target detection and for estimation of various parameters, such as angle of arrival and Doppler. For target location, it is shown that coherent processing can provide a resolution far exceeding that supported by the radar's waveform.

Our work proposes an approach to extract temporal patterns from data to predict the occurrence of target events, such as computer attacks on host networks, or fraudulent transactions in financial institutions. Our problem formulation exhibits two major challenges: 1) we assume events being characterized by categorical features and displaying uneven inter-arrival times; such an assumption falls outside the scope of classical time-series analysis, 2) we assume target events are highly infrequent; predictive techniques must deal with the class-imbalance problem. We propose an efficient algorithm that tackles the challenges above by transforming the event prediction problem into a search for all frequent eventsets preceding target events. The class imbalance problem is overcome by a search for patterns on the minority class exclusively; the discrimination power of patterns is then validated against other classes. Patterns are then combined into a rule-based model for prediction. Our experimental analysis indicates the types of event sequences where target events can be accurately predicted.

Experiments show that our algorithm has a lower memory consumption than previous approaches and is more efficient when the volume resolution is high. In addition, our algorithm requires no preprocessing and is suitable for voxelizing deformable models.

A stable matching is a complete matching of men and women such that no man and woman who are not partners both prefer each other to their actual partners under the matching. It is well known [2] that at least one stable matching exists for every stable marriage instance. However, the classical Gale-Shapley algorithm produces a marriage that greatly favors the men at the expense of the women, or vice versa. The problem arises of finding a stable matching that is optimal under some more equitable or egalitarian criterion of optimality. This problem was posed by Knuth [6] and has remained unsolved for some time. Here, the objective of maximizing the average (or, equivalently, the total) “satisfaction” of all people is used. This objective is achieved when a person's satisfaction is measured by the position of his/her partner in his/her preference list. By exploiting the structure of the set of all stable matchings, and using graph-theoretic methods, an O(n4) algorithm for this problem is derived.

To improve the identification accuracy of maize leaf diseases and reduce the number of network parameters, the improved GoogLeNet and Cifar10 models based on deep learning are proposed for leaf disease recognition in this paper. Two improved models that are used to train and test nine kinds of maize leaf images are obtained by adjusting the parameters, changing the pooling combinations, adding dropout operations and rectified linear unit functions, and reducing the number of classifiers. In addition, the number of parameters of the improved models is significantly smaller than that of the VGG and AlexNet structures. During the recognition of eight kinds of maize leaf diseases, the GoogLeNet model achieves a top - 1 average identification accuracy of 98.9%, and the Cifar10 model achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%. The improved methods are possibly improved the accuracy of maize leaf disease, and reduced the convergence iterations, which can effectively improve the model training and recognition efficiency.

To produce a best evidence synthesis of exercise prescription used when treating shoulder pathology in the overhead athlete.


DESIGN
A systematic review of exercises used in overhead athletes including case studies and clinical commentaries.


DATA SOURCES
MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus and CINAHL from database inception through July 8, 2016.


METHODS
We examined data from randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort (level I-IV evidence) studies that addressed exercise intervention in the rehabilitation of the overhead athlete with shoulder pathology. Case studies and clinical commentaries (level V evidence) were examined to account for expert opinion-based research. Data were combined using best evidence synthesis and graded (A-F) recommendations (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine).


RESULTS
There were 33 unique exercises in six level I-IV studies that met our inclusion criteria. Most exercises were single-plane, upper extremity exercises performed below 90o of elevation. There were 102 unique exercises in 33 level V studies that met our inclusion criteria. These exercises emphasised plyometrics, kinetic chain and sport-specific training.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Overall, evidence for exercise interventions in overhead athletes with shoulder pathology is dominated by expert opinion (grade D). There is great variability between exercise approaches suggested by experts and those investigated in research studies and the overall level of evidence is low.

Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) have been shown to be a powerful method of representing such movements, but do not generalize well when used in configuration or task space. To solve this problem we propose a model called autoencoded dynamic movement primitive (AE-DMP) which uses deep autoencoders to find a representation of movement in a latent feature space, in which DMP can optimally generalize. The architecture embeds DMP into such an autoencoder and allows the whole to be trained as a unit. To further improve the model for multiple movements, sparsity is added for the feature layer neurons; therefore, various movements can be observed clearly in the feature space. After training, the model finds a single hidden neuron from the sparsity that can efficiently generate new movements. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the efficiency of missing data imputation using 50-dimensional human movement data.

In reinforcement learning, where agents often require a considerable amount of training, transfer learning comprises a suitable solution for speeding up learning. Transfer learning methods have primarily been applied in single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, while no prior work has addressed this issue in the case of multi-agent learning. This work proposes a novel method for transfer learning in multi-agent reinforcement learning domains. We test the proposed approach in a multiagent domain under various setups. The results demonstrate that the method helps to reduce the learning time and increase the asymptotic performance.

Recently, deep convolutional networks have yielded breakthroughs in predicting image labels, annotations and captions, but have only just begun to be used for generating high-quality images. In this paper we develop a novel deep network trained end-to-end to perform visual analogy making, which is the task of transforming a query image according to an example pair of related images. Solving this problem requires both accurately recognizing a visual relationship and generating a transformed query image accordingly. Inspired by recent advances in language modeling, we propose to solve visual analogies by learning to map images to a neural embedding in which analogical reasoning is simple, such as by vector subtraction and addition. In experiments, our model effectively models visual analogies on several datasets: 2D shapes, animated video game sprites, and 3D car models.

Aphasia rehabilitation requires intensive practice accompanied by appropriate feedback, the latter of which is difficult to satisfy outside of therapy. In this paper we take a first step towards developing an intelligent system capable of providing feedback to patients with aphasia through the automation of two typical therapeutic exercises, sentence building and picture description. We describe the natural speech corpus collected from our interaction with clients in the University of Michigan Aphasia Program (UMAP). We develop classifiers to automatically estimate speech quality based on human perceptual judgment. Our automatic prediction yields accuracies comparable to the average human evaluator. Our feature selection process gives insights into the factors that influence human evaluation. The results presented in this work provide support for the feasibility of this type of system.

We frame AM both as a tokenbased dependency parsing and as a tokenbased sequence tagging problem, including a multi-task learning setup. Contrary to models that operate on the argument component level, we find that framing AM as dependency parsing leads to subpar performance results. In contrast, less complex (local) tagging models based on BiLSTMs perform robustly across classification scenarios, being able to catch longrange dependencies inherent to the AM problem. Moreover, we find that jointly learning ‘natural’ subtasks, in a multi-task learning setup, improves performance.	['2620186', '1790638', '1730400']	[]	[]	2017.0

This separation creates difficulties for safety engineers to analyze what, when, why and where safety measures are needed for preventing accidents. Lack of information and integration of available data (safety plan, project schedule, 2D project drawings) during the planning stage often results in scheduling work activities with overlapping space needs that then can create hazardous conditions, for example, work above other crew. These space requirements are time dependent and often neglected due to the manual effort that is required to handle the data. Representation of project-specific activity space requirements in 4D models hardly happen along with schedule and work break-down structure. Even with full cooperation of all related stakeholders, current safety planning and execution still largely depends on manual observation and past experiences. The traditional manual observation is inefficient, error-prone, and the observed result can be easily effected by subjective judgments. This paper will demonstrate the development of an automated safety code checking tool for Building Information Modeling (BIM), work breakdown structure, and project schedules in conjunction with safety criteria to reduce the potential for accidents on construction projects. The automated safety compliance rule checker code builds on existing applications for building code compliance checking, structural analysis, and constructability analysis etc. and also the advances in 4D simulations for scheduling. Preliminary results demonstrate a computer-based automated tool can assist in safety planning and execution of projects on a day to day basis.	['3997031']	[]	[]	2011.0

Dynamic consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) presents a significant opportunity to save energy in data centers. A VM consolidation approach uses live migration of VMs so that some of the under-loaded Physical Machines (PMs) can be switched-off or put into a low-power mode. On the other hand, achieving the desired level of Quality of Service (QoS) between cloud providers and their users is critical. Therefore, the main challenge is to reduce energy consumption of data centers while satisfying QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a distributed system architecture to perform dynamic VM consolidation to reduce energy consumption of cloud data centers while maintaining the desired QoS. Since the VM consolidation problem is strictly NP-hard, we use an online optimization metaheuristic algorithm called Ant Colony System (ACS). The proposed ACS-based VM Consolidation (ACS-VMC) approach finds a near-optimal solution based on a specified objective function. Experimental results on real workload traces show that ACS-VMC reduces energy consumption while maintaining the required performance levels in a cloud data center. It outperforms existing VM consolidation approaches in terms of energy consumption, number of VM migrations, and QoS requirements concerning performance.

We see this capability as a step toward bringing OLAP capabilities, traditionally supported by databases over relational data, to the domain of free-text queries over metadata-rich content. Our second extension shows how one can efficiently extend a faceted search engine to support correlated facets - a more complex information model in which the values associated with a document across multiple facets are not independent.

The dark triad dimensions have typically been conceptualized as stable personality traits, ignoring the accumulating evidence that momentary personality expressions - personality states - may change due to the characteristics of the situation. The present research protocol describes a qualitative study that aims to identify triggers of dark triad states at work by following a grounded theory approach using semi-structured interviews. By building a comprehensive categorization of dark triad triggers at work scholars may study these triggers in a parsimonious and structured way and organizations may derive more effective interventions to buffer or prevent the detrimental effects of dark personality at work.

In this task, cybersecurity situational awareness is a cornerstone to ensure that systems are protected in a meaningful way. However, cybersecurity situational awareness can be built in various ways. Firstly, several monitoring and analysing techniques can be applied, and secondly, a time window for the usage of situational awareness varies from short-term operational to long-term strategic decision making. Understanding differences and purposes of these aspects is an essential part to research and develop cybersecurity situational awareness. In this paper, we build a taxonomy of cybersecurity situational awareness. The taxonomy categorises terminology, makes it possible to recognise missing areas, and to understand the area in a uniform way. Moreover, the taxonomy helps to select the most effective techniques to be used in a specific situation awareness implementation.

We demonstrate cooperative optical and catalytic functions of the core-shell components of the QDs in the analysis of RDX.	['5812401', '1901503']	[]	[]	2009.0

Using constraints at two levels; Topological (Adjacency, Compactness, Vaastu, and Open and Closed face constraints) and Dimensional (Length to Width ratio constraint), Genetic Algorithms have been used to generate the topological arrangement of spaces in the layout and further if required, feasibility have been dimensionally analyzed. Further easy evacuation form the selected layout in case of adversity has been proposed using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Later the proposed model has been tested for efficiency using various test cases. This paper also presents a classification and categorization of various problems of space planning.

Yet existing policy abstractions and frameworks do not support natural expression and automatic composition of high-level policies from diverse sources. We tackle the open problem of automatic, correct and fast composition of multiple independently specified network policies. We first develop a high-level Policy Graph Abstraction (PGA) that allows network policies to be expressed simply and independently, and leverage the graph structure to detect and resolve policy conflicts efficiently. Besides supporting ACL policies, PGA also models and composes service chaining policies, i.e., the sequence of middleboxes to be traversed, by merging multiple service chain requirements into conflict-free composed chains. Our system validation using a large enterprise network policy dataset demonstrates practical composition times even for very large inputs, with only sub-millisecond runtime latencies.

We aim to contribute with further understanding of the importance of citizen participation and involvement within the e-government research body of knowledge and when developing public eservices in practice. Design/Methodology/Approach – The analysis in the article is made from a comparative, qualitative case study of two e-government projects. Three analysis themes are induced from the literature review; practice of participation, incentives for participation, and organization of participation. These themes are guiding the comparative analysis of our data with a concurrent openness to interpretations from the field. Findings – The main results in this article are that the e-government field can get inspiration and learn from methods and approaches in traditional IS projects concerning user participation, but in egovernment we also need methods to handle the challenges that arise when designing public e-services for large, heterogeneous user groups. Citizen engagement cannot be seen as a separate challenge in egovernment, but rather as an integrated part of the process of organizing, managing, and performing egovernment projects. Our analysis themes of participation generated from literature; practice, incentives and organization can be used in order to highlight, analyze, and discuss main issues regarding the challenges of citizen participation within e-government. This is an important implication based on our study that contributes both to theory on and practice of e-government. Practical implications – Lessons to learn from this study concern that many e-government projects have a public e-service as one outcome and an internal e-administration system as another outcome. A dominating internal, agency perspective in such projects might imply that citizens as the user group of the e-service are only seen as passive receivers of the outcome – not as active participants in the development. By applying the analysis themes, proposed in this article, citizens as active participants can be thoroughly discussed when initiating (or evaluating) an e-government project. Originality/value – This article addresses challenges regarding citizen participation in e-government development projects. User participation is well-researched within the IS discipline, but the egovernment setting implies new challenges, that are not explored enough.

IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	This paper proposes a new application for the rotary VCM. In developing a low cost ultrasound scanner for the developing world an oscillating transducer is required to sweep over the skin. The ultrasound scanner must operate from a USB power supply in remote locations. The application requires a 3.3N force on the coils of the motor to overcome the inertia of the skin. A proof of concept prototype motor with electronics has been designed, simulated and tested. The VCM optimisation is discussed in detail with the unique separation of the magnets being critical to reduce the axial bearing forces for this application.

This paper proposes a factorial mixture prior for capturing latent properties, thereby adding structured compositionality to deep generative models. The prior treats a latent vector as belonging to Cartesian product of subspaces, each of which is quantized separately with a Gaussian mixture model. Some mixture components can be set to represent properties as observed random variables whenever labeled properties are present. Through a combination of stochastic variational inference and gradient descent, a method for learning how to infer discrete properties in an unsupervised or semi-supervised way is outlined and empirically evaluated.

In this paper, we present a broad range of anti-analysis techniques that malware can employ to evade dynamic analysis in emulated Android environments. Our detection heuristics span three different categories based on (i) static properties, (ii) dynamic sensor information, and (iii) VM-related intricacies of the Android Emulator. To assess the effectiveness of our techniques, we incorporated them in real malware samples and submitted them to publicly available Android dynamic analysis systems, with alarming results. We found all tools and services to be vulnerable to most of our evasion techniques. Even trivial techniques, such as checking the value of the IMEI, are enough to evade some of the existing dynamic analysis frameworks. We propose possible countermeasures to improve the resistance of current dynamic analysis tools against evasion attempts.

It is theoretically possible for an autonomous system with sufficient sensor and effector capability and using reinforcement learning to learn that the kill switch deprives it of long-term reward and learn to act to disable the switch or otherwise prevent a human operator from using the switch. This is referred to as the big red button problem. We present a technique which prevents a reinforcement learning agent from learning to disable the big red button. Our technique interrupts the agent or robot by placing it in a virtual simulation where it continues to receive reward. We illustrate our technique in a simple grid world environment.

Though access to the sensory data is critical to the success of many beneficial applications such as health monitoring or activity recognition, a wide range of potentially sensitive information about the individuals can also be discovered through access to sensory data and this cannot easily be protected using traditional privacy approaches. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving sensing framework for managing access to time-series data in order to provide utility while protecting individuals' privacy. We introduce Replacement AutoEncoder, a novel feature-learning algorithm which learns how to transform discriminative features of multi-variate time-series that correspond to sensitive inferences, into some features that have been more observed in non-sensitive inferences, to protect users' privacy. This efficiency is achieved by defining a user-customized objective function for deep autoencoders. Replacement will not only eliminate the possibility of recognition sensitive inferences, it also eliminates the possibility of detecting the occurrence of them, that is the main weakness of other approaches such as filtering or randomization. We evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm with an activity recognition task in a multi-sensing environment using extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. We show that it can retain the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art techniques while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive information. Finally, we utilize the GANs for detecting the occurrence of replacement, after releasing data, and show that this can be done only if the adversarial network is trained on the users' original data.

The EKF exploits the measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that is integrated with a tri-axial magnetic sensor. Magnetic disturbances and gyro bias errors are modeled and compensated by including them in the filter state vector. We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the IMU is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the IMU is subject to some angular motions. Computer simulations and experimental testing are presented to evaluate the algorithm performance, including when the observability conditions are critical.

This application allows drivers who rarely use cars to only pay insurance premium for particular trips they would like to travel. One of the key challenges from database perspective is how to ensure all the data pertaining to the actual trip and premium payment made by the users are transparently recorded so that every party in the insurance contract including the driver, the insurance company, and the financial institution is confident that the data are tamper-proof and traceable. 
 Another challenge from information retrieval perspective is how to perform entity matching and pattern matching on customer data as well as their trip and claim history recorded on the blockchain for intelligent fraud detection. Last but not least, the drivers' trip history, once have been collected sufficiently, can be much valuable for the insurance company to do offline analysis and build statistics on past driving behaviour and past vehicle runtime. These statistics enable the insurance company to offer the users with transparent and individualized insurance quotes. Towards this end, we develop a blockchain-based solution for micro-insurance applications that transparently keeps records and executes smart contracts depending on runtime conditions while also connecting with off-chain analytic databases."

Extrusion-based bioprinting (EBB) is a rapidly growing technology that has made substantial progress during the last decade. It has great versatility in printing various biologics, including cells, tissues, tissue constructs, organ modules and microfluidic devices, in applications from basic research and pharmaceutics to clinics. Despite the great benefits and flexibility in printing a wide range of bioinks, including tissue spheroids, tissue strands, cell pellets, decellularized matrix components, micro-carriers and cell-laden hydrogels, the technology currently faces several limitations and challenges. These include impediments to organ fabrication, the limited resolution of printed features, the need for advanced bioprinting solutions to transition the technology bench to bedside, the necessity of new bioink development for rapid, safe and sustainable delivery of cells in a biomimetically organized microenvironment, and regulatory concerns to transform the technology into a product.

Although 2D image processingbased edge detection techniques have been popular in many application areas, they are not well developed for surfaces represented by triangle meshes. This paper proposes a robust edge detection algorithm for triangle meshes and its applications to surface segmentation and adaptive surface smoothing. The proposed edge detection technique is based on eigen analysis of the surface normal vector field in a geodesic window. To compute the edge strength of a certain vertex, the neighboring vertices in a specified geodesic distance are involved. Edge information are used further to segment the surfaces with watershed algorithm and to achieve edgepreserved, adaptive surface smoothing.

Each month, many women experience an ovulatory cycle that regulates fertility. Although research has found that this cycle influences women's mating preferences, we proposed that it might also change women's political and religious views. Building on theory suggesting that political and religious orientation are linked to reproductive goals, we tested how fertility influenced women's politics, religiosity, and voting in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In two studies with large and diverse samples, ovulation had drastically different effects on single women and women in committed relationships. Ovulation led single women to become more liberal, less religious, and more likely to vote for Barack Obama. In contrast, ovulation led women in committed relationships to become more conservative, more religious, and more likely to vote for Mitt Romney. In addition, ovulation-induced changes in political orientation mediated women's voting behavior. Overall, the ovulatory cycle not only influences women's politics but also appears to do so differently for single women than for women in relationships.

This flexibility comes at a high cost in terms of developer effort, as each application must repeatedly tackle the same challenges (e.g., fault tolerance, task scheduling and coordination) and reimplement common mechanisms (e.g., caching, bulk-data transfers). This article presents REEF, a development framework that provides a control plane for scheduling and coordinating task-level (data-plane) work on cluster resources obtained from a Resource Manager. REEF provides mechanisms that facilitate resource reuse for data caching and state management abstractions that greatly ease the development of elastic data processing pipelines on cloud platforms that support a Resource Manager service. We illustrate the power of REEF by showing applications built atop: a distributed shell application, a machine-learning framework, a distributed in-memory caching system, and a port of the CORFU system. REEF is currently an Apache top-level project that has attracted contributors from several institutions and it is being used to develop several commercial offerings such as the Azure Stream Analytics service.

Additionally, fast applicability and customization are desired. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly established technology with a potential to satisfy these conditions. EEG acquisition technology, currently one of the main modalities used for mobile brain activity assessment, is widely spread and open for access and thus easily customizable. fNIRS technology on the other hand has either to be bought as a predefined commercial solution or developed from scratch using published literature. To help reducing time and effort of future custom designs for research purposes, we present our approach toward an open source multichannel stand-alone fNIRS instrument for mobile NIRS-based neuroimaging, neuroergonomics and BCI/BMI applications. The instrument is low-cost, miniaturized, wireless and modular and openly documented on www.opennirs.org. It provides features such as scalable channel number, configurable regulated light intensities, programmable gain and lock-in amplification. In this paper, the system concept, hardware, software and mechanical implementation of the lightweight stand-alone instrument are presented and the evaluation and verification results of the instrument's hardware and physiological fNIRS functionality are described. Its capability to measure brain activity is demonstrated by qualitative signal assessments and a quantitative mental arithmetic based BCI study with 12 subjects.

Indeed, the Web of Data, a subset of the Semantic Web, has been increasing steadily in both volume and variety, transforming the Web into a ‘global database’ in which resources are linked across sites. Linguistic fields – in a broad sense – have not been left behind, and we observe a similar trend with the growth of linguistic data collections on the so-called ‘Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud’. While both Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing communities can obviously take advantage of this growing and distributed linguistic knowledge base, they are today faced with a new challenge, i.e., that of facilitating multilingual access to the Web of data. In this paper we present the publication of BabelNet 2.0, a wide-coverage multilingual encyclopedic dictionary and ontology, as Linked Data. The conversion made use of lemon, a lexicon model for ontologies particularly well-suited for this enterprise. The result is an interlinked multilingual (lexical) resource which can not only be accessed on the LOD, but also be used to enrich existing datasets with linguistic information, or to support the process of mapping datasets across languages.

We argue that arguments provide significant clues to this task, but they are either completely ignored or exploited in an indirect manner in existing detection approaches. In this work, we propose to exploit argument information explicitly for ED via supervised attention mechanisms. In specific, we systematically investigate the proposed model under the supervision of different attention strategies. Experimental results show that our approach advances state-ofthe-arts and achieves the best F1 score on ACE 2005 dataset.

N-gram tracing is a novel method for authorship attribution designed for very short texts, which has its roots in forensic linguistics. We evaluate the performance of both methods in a series of experiments on English, French and German literary texts, in order to investigate the relationship between authorship attribution accuracy and text length as well as the composition of the comparison corpus. Our results show that, at least in our setting, both methods require relatively long texts and are furthermore highly sensitive to the choice of authors and texts in the comparison corpus.

Since the ECG is a nonlinear signal, the subtle changes in its amplitude and duration are not well manifested in time and frequency domains. Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce a machine-learning approach to screen arrhythmia from normal sinus rhythm from the ECG. The methodology consists of R-point detection using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition, sub-band principal component analysis (PCA), statistical validation of features, and subsequent pattern classification. The k-fold cross validation is used in order to reduce the bias in choosing training and testing sets for classification. The average accuracy of classification is used as a benchmark for comparison. Different classifiers used are Gaussian mixture model (GMM), error back propagation neural network (EBPNN), and support vector machine (SVM). The DWT basis functions used are Daubechies-4, Daubechies-6, Daubechies-8, Symlet-2, Symlet-4, Symlet-6, Symlet-8, Coiflet-2, and Coiflet-5. An attempt is made to exploit the energy compaction in the wavelet sub-bands to yield higher classification accuracy. Results indicate that the Symlet2 wavelet basis function provides the highest accuracy in classification. Among the classifiers, SVM yields the highest classification accuracy, whereas EBPNN yields a higher accuracy than GMM. The use of other time frequency representations using different time frequency kernels as a future direction is also observed. The developed machine-learning approach can be used in a web-based telemedicine system, which can be used in remote monitoring of patients in many healthcare informatics systems. R. J. Martis (&) C.

The trend in web apps is ""mashups"" which integrate JavaScript code from multiple providers in ways that can undercut existing security mechanisms. Researchers are exploring dynamic information flow controls (IFC) for JavaScript, but there are many challenges to achieving strong IFC without excessive performance cost or impractical browser modifications. This paper presents an inlined IFC monitor for ECMAScript 5 with web support, using the no-sensitive-upgrade (NSU) technique, together with experimental evaluation using synthetic mashups and performance benchmarks. On this basis it should be possible to conduct experiments at scale to evaluate feasibility of both NSU and inlined monitoring."

The lateral geniculate nucleus is the best understood thalamic relay and serves as a model for all thalamic relays. Only 5-10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem. These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.

In the past, only a few studies covered all the different weather conditions and almost none of them had paid attention to the safety at vehicle lateral blind spot area. So, this paper proposes a hybrid scheme for pedestrian and vehicle detection, and develop a warning system dedicated for lateral blind spot area under different weather conditions and driving speeds. More specifically, the HOG and SVM methods are used for pedestrian detection. The image subtraction, edge detection and tire detection are applied for vehicle detection. Experimental results also show that the proposed system can efficiently detect pedestrian and vehicle under several scenarios.

Although the concept of database forensics has been around for a while, the investigation of cybercrime activities and cyber breaches in an Internet of Things environment would benefit from the development of a common investigative standard that unifies the knowledge in the domain. Therefore, this paper proposes common database forensic investigation processes using a design science research approach. The proposed process comprises four phases, namely: 1) identification; 2) artefact collection; 3) artefact analysis; and 4) the documentation and presentation process. It allows the reconciliation of the concepts and terminologies of all common database forensic investigation processes; hence, it facilitates the sharing of knowledge on database forensic investigation among domain newcomers, users, and practitioners.

This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference) diagrams.

Recent neurophysiological, psychological and neuropsychological research suggests that this extended motor capability is followed by changes in specific neural networks that hold an updated map of body shape and posture (the putative ""Body Schema"" of classical neurology). These changes are compatible with the notion of the inclusion of tools in the ""Body Schema"", as if our own effector (e.g. the hand) were elongated to the tip of the tool. In this review we present empirical support for this intriguing idea from both single-neuron recordings in the monkey brain and behavioural performance of normal and brain-damaged humans. These relatively simple neural and behavioural aspects of tool-use shed light on more complex evolutionary and cognitive aspects of body representation and multisensory space coding for action."

In environmental education, the concern is not only the enhancement of the students’ conceptual understanding, but also the development of awareness and concern for the environment. Community-based learning in environmental education is a pedagogical approach that is based on the premise that students learn to connect environmental concepts with the real world, hence, creating meaningful learning experience. This study aims to design and evaluate community-based approach in learning environmental science for senior high school students. The mixed method approach was used in this study, which was done through quasi-experimental design and qualitative analysis of the students’ written responses to open-ended questions. Two groups of students have participated in this study: (I) the traditional learning group and; (II) the community-based learning group. Results revealed an improved academic performance based on the gain score analysis wherein the community-based learning group had a statistically significant higher achievement than the traditional learning group. Moreover, the development of more positive environmental attitudes was also observed in the community-based learning group. In addition, the role of the community members appeared to be significant in the learning process, based on the students’ responses to the open-ended questions. In learning real environmental issues, community-based learning is a promising approach in enhancing students’ environmental knowledge, and in developing more positive environmental attitudes. Moreover, this approach provides an opportunity for personal and social growth, and the development of one’s sense of responsibility and accountability.

Ende 2014 soll sie als Produkt erscheinen. Die Oculus Rift, eine Brille, die ihre Träger in eine Virtuelle Realität (VR) versetzen kann. Bisherige VR-Brillen kosten oft mehr als das Zehnfache und vermitteln aufgrund eines eingeschränkteren Sichtfelds keinen derart guten Eindruck einer virtuellen 3D Welt. Bessere Hardware für einen Bruchteil des Preises? Kein Einzelfall. Ein neues Anwendungsfeld macht es möglich: Entertainment. Statt wie bisherige VR Hardware eine kleine Zielgruppe z. B. für industrielle Anwendungen zu adressieren, zielen neue Geräte auf den Computerspielemarkt, einen Massenmarkt. Nach einer vom Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware in Auftrag gegebene Studie der GfK wird das Marktvolumen allein in Deutschland mit 1,82 Milliarden Euro beziffert. Die Firma Oculus VR brauchte vor dem Hintergrund derartiger Marktperspektiven nur vier Stunden, um über Crowdfunding mittels der Online-Plattform Kickstarter 250.000 US$ als Startkapital zu sammeln. Das Unternehmen wurde inzwischen für ca. zwei Milliarden US$ aufgekauft. Insgesamt bieten derart erschwingliche Hardware und derart hohe Investitionen für die Anwendbarkeit und die Verbreitung von VR neue Perspektiven. Wird VR also massentauglich werden können? VR verfolgt das Ziel, Nutzer in eine scheinbare Welt zu versetzen, in der sie sich präsent fühlen. Dazu werden Technologien eingesetzt, die das Eintauchen, die Immersion, in diese virtuelle Welt erleichtern sollen, indem künstliche Reize für die visuelle und auditive Wahrnehmung erzeugt werden, manchmal auch für weitere Sinne wie den haptischen Sinn oder den Gleichgewichtssinn. Spezielle VR-Brillen spielen über ein Display dem rechten und linken Auge Bilder einer virtuellen 3D Welt ein. Außerdem ermittelt ein Sensor die aktuelle Kopfposition und Blickrichtung, sodass man sich in der virtuellen Welt durch Drehen des Kopfes einfach umschauen kann, genauso wie man es auch aus der Realität gewohnt ist. Im Extremfall einer perfekten VR könnte man virtuelle Welt und Realität nicht mehr unterscheiden. Dies wird in einigen Science Fiction Filmen, z. B. ,,Die Matrix“ dargestellt, in denen die künstlichen Reize über eine Art Steckdose direkt in das Gehirn eingespielt werden. Soweit muss man aber nicht gehen, auch heute schafft man es schon, überzeugende virtuelle Umgebungen zu realisieren. Bei Menschen, die man an die Dachkante eines virtuellen Wolkenkratzers stellt, kann man erhöhten Pulsschlag und feuchte Hände feststellen. Und das obwohl diese Menschen wissen, dass sie nicht an einem gefährlichen Abgrund, sondern in einer sicheren VR Umgebung stehen. Hier kommt eine Eigenschaft von Menschen zum Tragen, die der Philosoph Samuel T.

The breast cancer risks are broadly classified into modifiable and non –modifiable factors. The non modifiable risk factors are age, gender, number of first degree relatives suffering from breast cancer, menstrual history, age at menarche and age at menopause. While the modifiable risk factors are BMI, age at first child birth, number of children, duration of breast feeding, alcohol, diet and number of abortions. This paper presents a diagnosis system for detecting breast cancer based on RepTree, RBF Network and Simple Logistic. In test stage, 10-fold cross validation method was applied to the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia database to evaluate the proposed system performances. The correct classification rate of proposed system is 74.5%. This research demonstrated that the Simple Logistic can be used for reducing the dimension of feature space and proposed Rep Tree and RBF Network model can be used to obtain fast automatic diagnostic systems for other diseases.

These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, confirm the effectiveness of this new approach.

There exist many proposals of process improvement patterns (PIPs) as practices that aim at supporting this goal. Selecting and implementing relevant PIPs are therefore an important prerequisite for establishing process-aware information systems in enterprises. Nevertheless, there is still a gap regarding the validation of PIPs with respect to their actual business value for a specific application scenario before implementation investments are incurred. Based on empirical research as well as experiences from BPM projects, this paper proposes a method to tackle this challenge. Our approach toward the assessment of process improvement patterns considers real-world constraints such as the role of senior stakeholders or the cost of adapting available IT systems. In addition, it outlines process improvement potentials that arise from the information technology infrastructure available to organizations, particularly regarding the combination of enterprise resource planning with business process intelligence. Our approach is illustrated along a real-world business process from human resource management. The latter covers a transactional volume of about 29,000 process instances over a period of 1 year. Overall, our approach enables both practitioners and researchers to reasonably assess PIPs before taking any process implementation decision.

Our experiments with varying application workloads demonstrate that Kingfisher is able to (i) decrease the cost of virtual server resources by as much as $24\%$ compared to the current cost-unaware approach, (ii) reduce by an order of magnitude the time to transition to a new configuration through multiple elasticity mechanisms in the cloud, and (iii), illustrate the opportunity for design alternatives which trade-off the cost of server resources with the time required to scale the application.

Since its introduction, the orbitrap has proven to be a robust mass analyzer that can routinely deliver high resolving power and mass accuracy. Unlike conventional ion traps such as the Paul and Penning traps, the orbitrap uses only electrostatic fields to confine and to analyze injected ion populations. In addition, its relatively low cost, simple design and high space-charge capacity make it suitable for tackling complex scientific problems in which high performance is required. This review begins with a brief account of the set of inventions that led to the orbitrap, followed by a qualitative description of ion capture, ion motion in the trap and modes of detection. Various orbitrap instruments, including the commercially available linear ion trap-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometers, are also discussed with emphasis on the different methods used to inject ions into the trap. Figures of merit such as resolving power, mass accuracy, dynamic range and sensitivity of each type of instrument are compared. In addition, experimental techniques that allow mass-selective manipulation of the motion of confined ions and their potential application in tandem mass spectrometry in the orbitrap are described. Finally, some specific applications are reviewed to illustrate the performance and versatility of the orbitrap mass spectrometers.

The synthesis of large numbers of antibiotics over the past three decades has caused complacency about the threat of bacterial resistance. Bacteria have become resistant to antimicrobial agents as a result of chromosomal changes or the exchange of the exchange of genetic material via plasmids and transposons. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococci, organisms that cause respiratory and cutaneous infections, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas families, organisms that cause diarrhea, urinary infection, and sepsis, are now resistant to virtually all of the older antibiotics. The extensive use of antibiotics in the community and hospitals has fueled this crisis. Mechanisms such as antibiotic control programs, better hygiene, and synthesis of agents with improved antimicrobial activity need to be adopted in order to limit bacterial resistance.

The fundamental question that needs to be answered is how we can trust the validity of the data being generated in the first place. The problem, however, isnt inherent in whether or not to embrace the idea of an open platform and open-source software, but to establish a methodology to verify the trustworthiness and control any access. This paper focuses on building an access control model and system based on trust computing. This is a new field of access control techniques which includes Access Control, Trust Computing, Internet of Things, network attacks, and cheating technologies. Nevertheless, the target access control systems can be very complex to manage. This paper presents an overview of the existing work on trust computing, access control models and systems in IoT. It not only summarizes the latest research progress, but also provides an understanding of the limitations and open issues of the existing work. It is expected to provide useful guidelines for future research. Access Control, Trust Management, Internet of Things Today, our world is characterized by increasing connectivity. Things in this world are increasingly being connected. Smart phones have started an era of global proliferation and rapid consumerization of smart devices. It is predicted that the next disruptive transformation will be the concept of ‘Internet of Things’ [2]. From networked computers to smart devices, and to connected people, we are now moving towards connected ‘things’. Items of daily use are being turned into smart devices as various sensors are embedded in consumer and enterprise equipment, industrial and household appliances and personal devices. Pervasive connectivity mechanisms build bridges between our clothing and vehicles. Interaction among these things/devices can happen with little or no human intervention, thereby conjuring an enormous network, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the primary goals behind IoT is to sense and send data over remote locations to enable detection of significant events, and take relevant actions sooner rather than later [25]. This technological trend is being pursued actively in all areas including the medical and health care fields. IoT provides opportunities to dramatically improve many medical applications, such as glucose level sensing, remote health monitoring (e.g. electrocardiogram, blood pressure, body temperature, and oxygen saturation monitoring, etc), rehabilitation systems, medication management, and ambient assisted living systems. The connectivity offered by IoT extends from humanto-machine to machine-to-machine communications. The interconnected devices collect all kinds of data about patients. Intelligent and ubiquitous services can then be built upon the useful information extracted from the data. During the data aggregation, fusion, and analysis processes, user ar X iv :1 61 0. 01 06 5v 1 [ cs .C R ] 4 O ct 2 01 6 2 Z. Yunpeng and X. Wu privacy and information security become major concerns for IoT services and applications. Security breaches will seriously compromise user acceptance and consumption on IoT applications in the medical and health care areas. The large scale of integration of heterogeneous devices in IoT poses a great challenge for the provision of standard security services. Many IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks since no high-level intelligence can be enabled on these passive devices [10], and security vulnerabilities in products uncovered by researchers have spread from cars [13] to garage doors [9] and to skateboards [35]. Technological utopianism surrounding IoT was very real until the emergence of the Volkswagen emissions scandal [4]. The German conglomerate admitted installing software in its diesel cars that recognizes and identifies patterns when vehicles are being tested for nitrogen oxide emissions and cuts them so that they fall within the limits prescribed by US regulators (004 g/km). Once the test is over, the car returns to its normal state: emitting nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) at up to 35 times the US legal limit. The focus of IoT is not the thing itself, but the data generated by the devices and the value therein. What Volkswagen has brought to light goes far beyond protecting data and privacy, preventing intrusion, and keeping the integrity of the data. It casts doubts on the credibility of the IoT industry and its ability to secure data, reach agreement on standards, or indeed guarantee that consumer privacy rights are upheld. All in all, IoT holds tremendous potential to improve our health, make our environment safer, boost productivity and efficiency, and conserve both water and energy. IoT needs to improve its trustworthiness, however, before it can be used to solve challenging economic and environmental problems tied to our social lives. The fundamental question that needs to be answered is how we can trust the validity of the data being generated in the first place. If a node of IoT cheats, how does a system identify the cheating node and prevent a malicious attack from misbehaving nodes? This paper focuses on an access control mechanism that will only grant network access permission to trustworthy nodes. Embedding trust management into access control will improve the systems ability to discover untrustworthy participating nodes and prevent discriminatory attacks. There has been substantial research in this domain, most of which has been related to attacks like self-promotion and ballot stuffing where a node falsely promotes its importance and boosts the reputation of a malicious node (by providing good recommendations) to engage in a collusion-style attack. The traditional trust computation model is inefficient in differentiating a participant object in IoT, which is designed to win trust by cheating. In particular, the trust computation model will fail when a malicious node intelligently adjusts its behavior to hide its defect and obtain a higher trust value for its own gain. 1 Access Control Model and System IoT comprises the following three Access Control types Access Control in Internet of Things: A Survey 3 – Role-based access control (RBAC) – Credential-based access control (CBAC) — in order to access some resources and data, users require certain certificate information that falls into the following two types: 1. Attribute-Based access control (ABAC) : If a user has some special attributes, it is possible to access a particular resource or piece of data. 2. Capability-Based access control (Cap-BAC): A capability is a communicable, unforgeable rights markup, which corresponds to a value that uniquely specifies certain access rights to objects owned by subjects. – Trust-based access control (TBAC) In addition, there are also combinations of the aforementioned three methods. In order to improve the security of the system, some of the access control methods include encryption and key management mechanisms.

This first release is limited to non-standalone NR operation, implying that NR devices rely on LTE for initial access and mobility. The final release-15 specifications, to be available in June 2018, will also support stand-alone NR operation. The difference between stand-alone and non-standalone operation is primarily affecting higher layers and the interface to the core network; the basic radio technology is the same in both cases. This paper will give a detailed overview of the NR radioaccess technology with focus on the key features that distinguish it from 4G LTE.

The evaluated methods consist of two batch mode trackers (Berclaz et al, 2011, Ben-Shitrit et al, 2011) and one recursive tracker (Liem and Gavrila, 2011), which integrate appearance cues and temporal information differently. We also added our own improved version of the recursive tracker. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of the type of background estimation (static vs. adaptive) on tracking performance. Experiments are performed on two novel and challenging multi-person surveillance data sets (indoor, outdoor), made public to facilitate benchmarking.

By switching the PIN diodes, the four transmission modes with selected phase differences can be electrically tuned at two output ports. For each mode, the measured insertion loss of the feeding network is less than 0.8 dB at the operating frequency. Because of its compact size, the proposed feeding network can be further integrated with a dual-polarized aperture-coupled antenna, which can exhibit two orthogonal linear polarizations and two orthogonal circular polarizations. Measured results of the polarization-agile antenna are shown in detail, which verify its performance.

We extend the UD guidelines to cover special constructions in tweets that affect tokenization, part-ofspeech tagging, and labeled dependencies. Using the extended guidelines, we create a new tweet treebank for English (TWEEBANK V2) that is four times larger than the (unlabeled) TWEEBANK V1 introduced by Kong et al. (2014). We characterize the disagreements between our annotators and show that it is challenging to deliver consistent annotation due to ambiguity in understanding and explaining tweets. Nonetheless, using the new treebank, we build a pipeline system to parse raw tweets into UD. To overcome annotation noise without sacrificing computational efficiency, we propose a new method to distill an ensemble of 20 transition-based parsers into a single one. Our parser achieves an improvement of 2.2 in LAS over the un-ensembled baseline and outperforms parsers that are state-ofthe-art on other treebanks in both accuracy and speed.

People share their moments with their friends and families via these tools to keep in touch. This extensiveness of social media has led to an expansion of information in various forms. It is difficult to imagine someone totally unfamiliar with these concepts and not having posted any content on a platform. All users, ranging from individuals to large companies, want to get the most of their audiences' attention. Nevertheless, the problem is that not all these posts are admired and noticed by their audience. Therefore, it would be important to know what characteristics a post should have to become the most popular. Studying this enormous data will develop a knowledge from which we can understand the best way to publish our posts. To this end, we gathered images and videos from Instagram accounts and we used some image/video context features to predict the number of likes a post obtains as a meaning of popularity through some regression and classification methods. By the experiments with 10-fold cross-validation, we get the results of Popularity Score prediction with 0.002 in RMSE and Popularity Class prediction with 90.77% accuracy. As we know, this study is the first exploring of Iranian Instagram users for popularity prediction.

Thirty-two fetuses between 23 and 38 weeks’ gestation with abnormal appearance of the GI tract by ultrasound underwent MR imaging with T1- and T2-weighted sequences. The MR aspect of intestinal atresia (duodenal atresia, one case; small bowel atresia, nine cases) included dilatation of the bowel loops, accurate assessment of the normal bowel distal to the atresia (except in the patient with multiple atresia and apple-peel syndrome), and micro-rectum with decreased T1 signal (except in the patient with duodenal atresia). Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (one case) was indicated by an abnormal signal of the entire bowel and an abnormal pattern for the urinary tract. Meconium pseudocysts (two cases) were easily differentiated from enteric cysts (two cases). High anorectal malformations with (two cases) or without (one case) urinary fistula and cloacal malformation (one case) are described and MR findings are discussed. The capability of MR imaging to demonstrate the normal bowel with intraperitoneal anomalies (e.g., congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and sacrococcygeal teratoma) is emphasized. MR imaging is informative in the diagnosis of GI tract abnormalities, especially the severe malformations, with much more accuracy than sonography.

This type of sensor has been used for the plant structure characterization of several crops. However, the discrimination of small plants, such as weeds, is still a challenge within agricultural fields. Improvements in the new Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor can capture the details of plants. The use of a dual methodology using height selection and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) segmentation can separate crops, weeds, and soil. This paper explores the possibilities of this sensor by using Kinect Fusion algorithms to reconstruct 3D point clouds of weed-infested maize crops under real field conditions. The processed models showed good consistency among the 3D depth images and soil measurements obtained from the actual structural parameters. Maize plants were identified in the samples by height selection of the connected faces and showed a correlation of 0.77 with maize biomass. The lower height of the weeds made RGB recognition necessary to separate them from the soil microrelief of the samples, achieving a good correlation of 0.83 with weed biomass. In addition, weed density showed good correlation with volumetric measurements. The canonical discriminant analysis showed promising results for classification into monocots and dictos. These results suggest that estimating volume using the Kinect methodology can be a highly accurate method for crop status determination and weed detection. It offers several possibilities for the automation of agricultural processes by the construction of a new system integrating these sensors and the development of algorithms to properly process the information provided by them.

E-commerce is the medium that leads to economic growth of a country. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in contributing to the Gross Domestic Product and reducing the unemployment. However, there are some specific factors that inhibit the implementation of e-commerce among SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire approach was employed in this study and 160 questionnaires have been distributed but only 91usable questionnaires have been collected from SMEs. Literature found that main barriers to e-commerce adoption among SMEs are organizational barriers, financial barriers, technical barriers, legal and regulatory barriers, and behavioral barriers. Findings: Of this study showed that all these barriers carried an average influence on ecommerce adoption. The most important factor barriers of e-commerce adoption are legal and regulatory barriers followed by technical barriers, whereas lack of internet security is the highest barrier factor that inhibits the implementation of e-commerce in SMEs followed by the requirement to undertake additional training and skill development. Practical implications: This paper is useful for the management of SMEs in understanding and gaining insights into the real and potential barriers to e-commerce adoption. This can help the organization to design strategy in taking up barriers tactfully to its advantage.

The proposed design exhibits unidirectional radiation characteristics, high gain, high front to back ratio (FTBR) at each resonant frequency while maintaining low profile, planar configuration. The unique slot shape helps to introduce complex current distribution at different frequencies that results in simultaneous excitation of hybrid mode at higher frequency along with conventional TE120 mode in the cavity. Both conventional mode and the hybrid mode helps the modified slot to radiate at the corresponding resonant frequencies resulting in compact, dual-frequency antenna. A fabricated prototype is also presented which resonates at 9.5 GHz and 13.85 GHz with impedance bandwidth more than 1.5% at both resonant frequencies and gain of 4.8 dBi and 3.74 dBi respectively. The front-to-back ratio of the antenna are above 10 dB at both operating frequencies.

Suicide by stabbing to the head and/or driving sharp objects into the skull is of extreme rarity. This article reports the case of a 27-year-old man, who committed suicide by multiple knife stabs and cuts to the head, the torso, one shoulder and the forearms. Autopsy showed a perforating wound of the skull and the 10-cm long broken blade of the knife being still embedded in the right temporal lobe of the brain. The deceased had no history of psychiatric illness but was currently treated by mefloquine, a quinine derivative associated with a high rate of psychiatric adverse effects. Toxicological examination confirmed a recent intake of mefloquine together with chloroquine, another antimalarial drug. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a completed suicide with very strong evidence of mefloquine implication. Discussion focuses upon mefloquine-induced psychiatric disorders and highlights the importance of performing toxicological investigations in cases of unusual suicides.

We argue that defining a modeling operation by asking for rigidity of the local transformations is useful in various settings. Such formulation leads to a non-linear, yet conceptually simple energy formulation, which is to be minimized by the deformed surface under particular modeling constraints. We devise a simple iterative mesh editing scheme based on this principle, that leads to detail-preserving and intuitive deformations. Our algorithm is effective and notably easy to implement, making it attractive for practical modeling applications.

Driving behaviors include types of destinations, driving efficiency, and trip times. Beyond considering previously visited destinations, Predestination leverages an open-world modeling methodology that considers the likelihood of users visiting previously unobserved locations based on trends in the data and on the background properties of locations. This allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between “out of the box” with no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of observations. Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian inference to produce a probabilistic map of destinations. Our algorithm was trained and tested on hold-out data drawn from a database of GPS driving data gathered from 169 different subjects who drove 7,335 different trips.

The purpose of this combined measurement is, on one hand, to reach a similar performance as that obtained in the inductor current controller with load current feedforward and, on the other hand, to easily obtain an estimate of the inductor current for overcurrent protection capability. Based on this combined current measurement, a voltage controller based on resonant harmonic filters is investigated in order to compensate for unbalance and harmonic distortion on the load. Adaptation is included to cope with uncertainties in the system parameters. It is shown that after transformations the proposed controller gets a simple and practical form that includes a bank of resonant filters, which is in agreement with the internal model principle and corresponds to similar approaches proposed recently. The controller is based on a frequency-domain description of the periodic disturbances, which include both symmetric components, namely, the negative and positive sequence.

Social network analysis is a methodological approach in the social sciences using graph-theoretic concepts to describe, understand and explain social structure. The isone software is an attempt to integrate analysis and visualization of social networks and is intended to be used in research and teaching. While we are primarily focussing on users in the social sciences, several features provided in the tool will be useful in other fields as well. In contrast to more conventional mathematical software in the social sciences that aim at providing a comprehensive suite of analytical options, our emphasis is on complementing every option we provide with tailored means of graphical interaction. We attempt to make complicated types of analysis and data handling transparent, intuitive, and more readily accessible. User feedback indicates that many who usually regard data exploration and analysis complicated and unnerving enjoy the playful nature of visual interaction. Consequently, much of the tool is about graph drawing methods specifically adapted to facilitate visual data exploration. The origins of isone lie in an interdisciplinary cooperation with researchers from political science which resulted in innovative uses of graph drawing methods for social network visualization, and prototypical implementations thereof.

When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recognition benchmarks by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.

L1 regularized logistic regression requires solving a convex optimization problem. However, standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems do not scale well enough to handle the large datasets encountered in many practical settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for L1 regularized logistic regression. Our algorithm iteratively approximates the objective function by a quadratic approximation at the current point, while maintaining the L1 constraint. In each iteration, it uses the efficient LARS (Least Angle Regression) algorithm to solve the resulting L1 constrained quadratic optimization problem. Our theoretical results show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Our experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms four previously published algorithms that were specifically designed to solve the L1 regularized logistic regression problem.

The relevance of these techniques is increasing as current sensory devices are developed with ever higher resolution, and problems involving multimodal data sources become more common. A plethora of feature extraction methods are available in the literature collectively grouped under the field of multivariate analysis (MVA). This article provides a uniform treatment of several methods: principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and orthonormalized PLS (OPLS), as well as their nonlinear extensions derived by means of the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). We also review their connections to other methods for classification and statistical dependence estimation and introduce some recent developments to deal with the extreme cases of large-scale and low-sized problems. To illustrate the wide applicability of these methods in both classification and regression problems, we analyze their performance in a benchmark of publicly available data sets and pay special attention to specific real applications involving audio processing for music genre prediction and hyperspectral satellite image processing for Earth and climate monitoring.

The current distribution in wires is affected by the skin effect and the field created by adjacent wires (proximity effect). This field depends on the current distribution in conductors, resulting in a closed-form problem. In this paper, we obtain the vector potential outside a conductor to estimate the effect of induced currents in the field shape over the neighboring conductors. We use the results to calculate the losses in planar windings such as those in domestic induction heaters. We obtain an equivalent resistance representing the losses in windings and compare it with measurements. This solution provides an accurate analytical approach to modeling the losses in close-packed windings	['3021488', '49820000', '49928030', '2379467']	[]	['ee49a7fc79fdea16f1012e8ed600762efd2c8f0e', '21d9955c76050936cefbbb9b1e4d32e6fd20197f']	2006.0

However, the success of these models turns out to be largely benchmark specific. We show that models trained on natural language inference dataset drawn from one benchmark fail to perform well in others, even if the notion of inference assumed in these benchmark tasks is the same or similar. We train five state-of-the-art neural network models on different datasets and show that each one of these fail to generalize outside of the respective benchmark. In light of these results we conclude that the current neural network models are not able to generalize in capturing the semantics of natural language inference, but seem to be overfitting to the specific dataset.

In this work, we propose an automatic (unsupervised) method for 3D surface reconstruction from raw unorganized point clouds acquired using low-cost 3D sensors. We have modified the growing neural gas network, which is a suitable model because of its flexibility, rapid adaptation and excellent quality of representation, to perform 3D surface reconstruction of different real-world objects and scenes. Some improvements have been made on the original algorithm considering colour and surface normal information of input data during the learning stage and creating complete triangular meshes instead of basic wire-frame representations. The proposed method is able to successfully create 3D faces online, whereas existing 3D reconstruction methods based on self-organizing maps required post-processing steps to close gaps and holes produced during the 3D reconstruction process. A set of quantitative and qualitative experiments were carried out to validate the proposed method. The method has been implemented and tested on real data, and has been found to be effective at reconstructing noisy point clouds obtained using low-cost 3D sensors.
