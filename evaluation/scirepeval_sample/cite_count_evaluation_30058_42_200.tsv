0	160107707	160107707	The That System of Seventeenth Century North Indian Ragas: a Preliminary Report on the Treatises of Kamilkhani	It would seem to be paradigmatic in the study of Indian classical music to say that one major difference between Karnatic music and its North Indian counterpart lies in their conception of the ragas and how they are classified. Beginning with Ramamatya's radical break with the past in the Swaramelakalanidhi (1550) the South Indian ragas were no longer to be organised according to the old method of parent ragas and jatis, but conceived according to their basic scalar material (te Nijenhuis 1977:20) Ramamatya's proposition of nineteen basic scales, or melas,2 led eventually to the development and enthusiastic adoption of a highly logical and practically based system of seventy two melakarta that account for all possible tonal permutations of the ragas. The North Indian ragas, however, were conceptualised until the twentieth century as a rather looser conglomeration of individual entities organised		2	0.6930000185966492
1	745350	745350	Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Residual Transfer Networks	The recent success of deep neural networks relies on massive amounts of labeled data. For a target task where labeled data is unavailable, domain adaptation can transfer a learner from a different source domain. In this paper, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep networks that can jointly learn adaptive classifiers and transferable features from labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. We relax a shared classifier assumption made by previous methods and assume that the source classifier and target classifier differ by a residual function. We enable classifier adaptation by plugging several layers into deep network to explicitly learn the residual function with reference to the target classifier. We fuse features of multiple layers with tensor product and embed them into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to match distributions for feature adaptation. The adaptation can be achieved in most feed forward models by extending them with new residual layers and loss functions, which can be trained efficiently via back propagation. Empirical evidence shows that the new approach outperforms state of the art methods on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.	NIPS	840	6.732999801635742

Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris) Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394 A survey of recent density functional theory methods shows a convergence to more accurate property calculations. [Also see Perspective by Skylaris] INTRODUCTION The reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics. RATIONALE This work focuses on density functional theory (DFT) a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain ""precision"" relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users. RESULTS We calculated equation of state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms. CONCLUSION Our work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations. Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results. Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts) codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts) The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all electron results (vertical direction) Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green to red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement. The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community wide effort that compared 15 solid state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew Burke Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements."

(2015) show that immigrants often choose host countries according to the ability to absorb an additional labour supply that they constitute. As a result, certain EU Member States experience the influx of the large amount of immigrants that might potentially cause disturbances on their labour markets. The stakeholders and migration policy makers, as well as labour associations, trade unions and members of general society confront the constant dilemma of allowing migrants to enter their respective countries and facing consequences that might follow including social unrests, unease, the rise of populism and xenophobia. With regard to the above, there is no wonder that the recent Brexit campaign recently waging in the United Kingdom and shaking up the political and economic scenes prior to the referendum held on the 23rd of June 2016 was largely drawing from the fears of migration and ""flooding"" the UK labour market (Vasilopoulou, 2016) In fact, the ""Brexiteers"" used migration as their main card a week or two before the day of the referendum trying to tip the vote to their side. It is ironic that possible consequences of Brexit might turn this debate around. According to the Office of National Statistics (2011) in 2011 alone, 2.68 million people born in other EU countries resided in the United Kingdom. This number reached 3.03 million by 2014 (Office of National Statistics, 2014) In the same time, there might be from 1.2 to almost 3 million people born in the UK or having the UK passport who live and work in other EU countries (Parliament, 2016) What might follow would be naturalization of migrants on either sides or the massive exodus if all other measures and solutions fail to resolve the situation.A common concern about the phenomenon of international migration that might shape the policies and the public attitudes is the common perception that migrants come into a country without any contribution to society and that they might only take the advantage of the conditions local labour markets and welfare states offer.In order to measure levels of integration and labour market inclusion, ""Migrant Integration Policy Index"" (MIPEX) is often employed (Niessen et al. 2010) The MIPEX is a tool that allows measuring and comparing diverse levels of integration with regard to different migration policy areas such as labour market mobility, education and access to long term residence, among other things. With the data contained in this index, the impact of integration in the immigration surplus might be explained and then used to generate advices that might improve integration and thus enhance economic benefits for local economy.The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 1 describes the situation with the international protection in the Czech Republic. Section 2 discusses the Czech migration policy and provisions with regard to the international protection applicants and beneficiaries. Section 3 analyses the issues of ""immigration surplus"" and MIPEX for the particular case of the Czech Republic. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the main findings and provides brief conclusions and policy implications.1. International protection regimes in the Czech RepublicThe Czech Republic has never been a very popular country for international migrants (except for the Ukrainians, Vietnamese of the citizens of the neighbouring Poland and Slovakia) Moreover, the number of applications for international protection in the Czech Republic has never been high in comparison with the other EU countries.In 2015, foreign nationals filed 1525 applications for international protection in the Czech Republic. The asylum was granted to 71 people and 399 people were put under the supplementary procedure (permission to stay in the country for a period from 1 to 3 years)"		46	3.8289999961853027

Our research objective was to study Candida species in urine samples of patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with obstructive uropathy and to investigate the virulence factors of the isolated Candida. Methods: Patients were divided into two groups: Group I (cases) 50 patients with UTIs and obstructive uropathy. Group II (control) 50 patients with UTIs but with no functional or anatomical obstruction of their urinary tract. Clinical histories and physical examinations, together with laboratory investigations of urine samples were carried out in all patients in this study. Mid stream urine samples were examined microscopically and by fungal cell culture. The isolated Candida species were identified by analytical profile index (API) Candida Virulence factors were determined for the isolated Candida. The susceptibility to fluconazole was evaluated. Results: This study revealed an overall isolation rate of 27% of Candida species among all patient groups. The rate was 36% in cases, and 18% in controls, a difference found to be statistically significant (P<0.05) By API, C.albicans was detected in 44% of Candida species in cases, and in 33% in controls. While C.glabrata was detected in 28% of Candida species in cases, and in 22% in controls. C.tropicalis was detected in 17% of Candida species in cases, and in 22% in controls. Both C.krusei and C.kyfr were detected in 5.5% of Candida species in cases, and in 11% in controls. In terms of virulence factors the study showed that 11 out of 27 (40.5% of Candida isolates were biofilm positive by tube adherence. Phospholipase activity was demonstrated in 12 out of 27 (44.5% of Candida isolates. Secretory aspartic proteinase activity was demonstrated in 13 out of 27 (48% of the Candida isolates. Conclusion: Candida is an important cause of UTIs and obstructive uropathy is a major predisposing factor.	Pakistan journal of medical sciences	13	2.565000057220459

However, that substance was never found and eventually abandoned. Further scientific attention slowly began in the 1930s referring to slime as a microbial product and then was inspired by ""How bacteria stick"" by Costerton et al. in 1978, and the matrix material was considered to be polysaccharides. Later, it turned out that proteins, nucleic acids and lipids were major other constituents of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) an acronym which was highly discussed. The role of the EPS matrix turns out to be fundamental for biofilms, in terms of keeping cells in proximity and allowing for extended interaction, resource capture, mechanical strength and other properties, which emerge from the life of biofilm organisms, including enhanced tolerance to antimicrobials and other stress. The EPS components are extremely complex and dynamic and fulfil many functional roles, turning biofilms into the most ubiquitous and successful form of life on Earth."

It is also considered to be expensive due to: (i) the large number of mutants generated; (ii) the time consuming activity of determining equivalent mutants; and (iii) the mutant execution time. It should also be remembered that real software artefacts of appropriate size including real faults are hard to find and prepare appropriately. In this paper we propose a mutation tool to generate valid First Order Mutants (FOM) for Conceptual Schemas (CS) based on UML Class Diagrams and evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency in generating valid and non equivalent mutants. Our main findings were: (1) FOM mutation operators can be automated to avoiding non valid mutants (49.1% (2) Fewer equivalent mutants were generated (7.2% and 74.3% were reduced by analysing the CS static structure in six subject CSs.

The paper presents an experiment allogenic penis transplantation model in Beagles, with a focus on recovery of blood supply and changes in tissue architecture. Twenty adult Beagles were allocated to 10 pairs for penile transplantation. After operation, the skin and glans were observed. If adverse symptoms occurred, the transplanted penis was resected and pathologically examined. Frequency of urination, urinary stream, and patency level were recorded 7 days after transplantation. Cystourethrography was performed on Day 10. The transplanted penises were resected on Day 14 for pathological examination. The research showed that transplanted penises survived after allotransplantation, and the dogs regained urination ability. Penis autotransplantation in Beagles is feasible. This preliminary study shows a potential for application of this new procedure for penis transplantation in humans.	BioMed research international	15	2.7079999446868896

Based on data from 28 European countries, the present study, unlike other previous studies analyzing the influence of individual drivers for waste generation or recycling, evaluates different options for waste management: government based, ""fair"" consumer and producer responsibility. For this, the influence of individual and socio demographic characteristics (age, gender, education level and occupational status) contextual variables (rural or urban, country of origin) and the environmental awareness of 23,976 individuals are considered. Being a woman, being well educated, having a good job and living in a rural or small town increase the probability of being a fair consumer, while men and people living in a large town are more willing to entrust this responsibility to firms. The government based solution is only chosen by low educated people. Finally, individuals with the highest environmental awareness and effort prefer to pay, while those who are less environmentally conscious prefer government action. The findings show that factors explaining individual acceptance of these different waste management policies (WMP) are essential for implementing proactive and preventive approaches to enhance responsibility and involvement of all stakeholder groups (consumers, firms and institutions)"		43	3.760999917984009

We develop a method that uses second order approximations of Ramsey policies to obtain formulas for conditional and unconditional moments of government debt and taxes that include means and variances of the invariant distribution as well as speeds of mean reversion. The asymptotic mean of the planner's portfolio minimizes a measure of fiscal risk. We obtain analytic expressions that approximate moments of the invariant distribution and apply them to data on a primary government deficit, aggregate consumption, and returns on traded securities. For U.S. data, we find that the optimal target debt level is negative but close to zero, the invariant distribution of debt is very dispersed, and mean reversion is slow.		58	4.059999942779541
10	114855222	114855222	A BIM based Decision Support System Framework for Predictive Maintenance Management of Building Facilities	Facility management (FM) involves multidisciplinary efforts and requires the coordination of different people, properties and processes. Therefore, extensive information of multiple dimensions needs to be stored and managed for FM. Currently, some buildings and facilities are managed manually, while some use databases and automated devices like sensors to capture and manage FM records. However, the current approaches do not fully utilize the collected FM records and provide a user friendly interface for facilitating the operation and maintenance (O&M) of building facilities. Several academic and commercial efforts attempted to leverage building information modeling (BIM) technology to link and visualize FM records, but these efforts are still weak in proactively predicting asset failure, suggesting maintenance schedules and allocating budget for FM. This paper presents a decision support system framework based on BIM for O&M of buildings. The framework consists of three modules: Condition Assessment Module, Failure Prediction Module, and Maintenance Planning and Budget Allocation Module. The Condition Assessment Module manages the facility condition data that are automatically captured by sensor devices as well as collected via inspection and condition survey. Incorporated with failure records and lifetime estimation models, the Failure Prediction Module integrates with the Condition Assessment Module and forecasts component failures. The results provide a basis for predictive maintenance of building facilities. BIM is also leveraged to manage and visualize not only the FM data but also the predictive maintenance results. Since each O&M action has its cost implications, the Maintenance Planning and Budget Allocation Module is included in this proposed framework to help facility managers evaluate cost implications and dynamically adjust maintenance plan.		11	2.3980000019073486
11	21494681	21494681	Example based super resolution via social images	A novel image patch based example based super resolution algorithm is proposed for benefitting from social image data. The proposed algorithm is designed based on matrix value operator learning techniques where the image patches are understood as the matrices and the single image super resolution is treated as a problem of learning a matrix value operator. Taking advantage of the matrix trick, the proposed algorithm is so fast that it could be trained on social image data. To our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the fastest single image super resolution algorithm when both training and test time are considered. Experimental results have shown the efficiency and the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm to most of state of the art single image super resolution algorithms.

12	9752308	9752308	Field Tests on Total Gap of Modular Expansion Joints to Avoid Bridge Pounding	Modular expansion joints (MEJs) are used for accommodating large relative displacements of adjacent bridge segments and for completely eliminating pounding. However, the minimum total gap that an MEJ needs to avoid pounding is not well investigated. To provide guidance for the seismic gap of MEJs, the maximum relative displacement of adjacent bridge segments subject to strong earthquakes was studied experimentally. To date, no experimental investigation of excitation spatial variation effect on bridge on natural soil has been reported. This research addressed a bridge with three identical segments of 100 m. A 1:22 scale bridge model founded on compacted beach sand was tested using electro magnetic inertial exciters. Different ground motions were applied to the model to simulate the effect of spatially varying ground motions. Soil structure interaction (SSI) was studied by comparing the minimum total gaps with those obtained from the fixed based experiments in the laboratory. The spatially varying ground motions were simulated based on the New Zealand design spectra for soft soil, shallow soil and strong rock conditions using an empirical coherency loss function. SSI was found to reduce the minimum total gap of an MEJ needed to avoid pounding between adjacent segments. Under spatially varying ground motions designing adjacent bridge segments with identical or similar fundamental frequencies is still recommended even if it does not necessarily preclude an out of phase movement of adjacent structures.

14	16790588	16790588	Refinement of the Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria in the era of immunomodulatory therapy.	"Uniformly adopted response criteria are essential for assessment of therapies incorporating conventional chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Recently, immunomodulatory agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated impressive activity in a broad range of lymphoma histologies. However, these agents may be associated with clinical and imaging findings during treatment suggestive of progressive disease (PD) despite evidence of clinical benefit (eg, tumor flare or pseudo progression) Considering this finding as PD could lead to patients being prematurely removed from a treatment from which they actually stand to benefit. This phenomenon has been well described with checkpoint blockade therapy in solid tumors and anecdotally seen in lymphoma as well. To address this issue in the context of lymphoma immunomodulatory therapy, a workshop was convened to provide provisional recommendations to modify current response criteria in patients receiving these and future agents in clinical trials. The term ""indeterminate response"" was introduced to identify such lesions until confirmed as flare/pseudo progression or true PD by either biopsy or subsequent imaging."

16	23296681	23296681	Determination of polar pesticides in olive oil and olives by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and high resolution mass spectrometry.	This article reports the development of two HPLC MS methods for the determination of polar pesticides in olive oil and olive samples by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation followed by mass spectrometry detection with tandem mass spectrometry using a triple quadrupole instrument operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode (HILIC MS/MS) or electrospray time of flight mass spectrometry (HILIC TOFMS) The selected polar pesticides included in the study were: amitrol, cyromazine, diquat, paraquat, mepiquat, trimethylsulfonium (trimesium, glyphosate counterion) and fosetyl aluminium. The simple sample treatment procedure was based on liquid partitioning with methanol. The performance of the sample extraction was evaluated in terms of recovery rates and matrix effects in both olive oil and olives matrices. The results obtained for olive oil were satisfactory while, due to the high complexity of olives, poor recovery rates were obtained for the extraction of diquat, paraquat and amitrol, although with a reasonable precision enabling its use in routine analysis. Similarly, matrix effects were minor in the case of olive oil (ca. 20% suppression average) while significantly higher suppression was observed for olives (30 50% suppression average) The studied approaches were found to be useful for the determination of the pesticides studied in olive oil and olives with limits of quantitation below 5ugkg( 1) in most cases when tandem mass spectrometry was used, thus being in compliance with MRLs set by current EU regulation.

This study utilizes data from two nationally representative data sources to examine the effect of state zero tolerance laws on suspension rates and principal perceptions of problem behaviors. Utilizing state and year fixed effects models, this study finds that state zero tolerance laws are predictive of a 0.5 percentage point increase in district suspension rates and no consistent decreases in principals' perceptions of problem behaviors. Furthermore, the results indicate that the laws are predictive of larger increases in suspension rates for Blacks than Whites, potentially contributing to the Black White suspension gap. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.		81	4.394000053405762

In real world videos, head pose, facial expression, scale, illumination, occlusion and some uncontrolled factors may dramatically change the appearance variations of faces. In this paper, we tackle this problem by learning non linear metric function with a deep convolutional neural network from the input image to a low dimensional feature embedding with the visual constraints among face tracks. Our network directly optimizes the embedding space so that the Euclidean distances correspond to a measure of semantic face similarity. This is technically realized by minimizing an improved triplet loss function, which pushes the negative face away from the positive pairs, and requires the distance of the positive pair to be less than a margin. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm on a set of challenging videos and demonstrate significant performance improvement over existing techniques.	PCM	24	3.177999973297119

Microbial communities inhabiting soil aggregates dynamically adjust their activity and composition in response to variations in hydration and other external conditions. These rapid dynamics shape signatures of biogeochemical activity and gas fluxes emitted from soil profiles. Recent mechanistic models of microbial processes in unsaturated aggregate like pore networks revealed a highly dynamic interplay between oxic and anoxic microsites jointly shaped by hydration conditions and by aerobic and anaerobic microbial community abundance and self organization. The spatial extent of anoxic niches (hotspots) flicker in time (hot moments) and support substantial anaerobic microbial activity even in aerated soil profiles. We employed an individual based model for microbial community life in soil aggregate assemblies represented by 3D angular pore networks. Model aggregates of different sizes were subjected to variable water, carbon and oxygen contents that varied with soil depth as boundary conditions. The study integrates microbial activity within aggregates of different sizes and soil depth to obtain estimates of biogeochemical fluxes from the soil profile. The results quantify impacts of dynamic shifts in microbial community composition on CO2 and N2 O production rates in soil profiles in good agreement with experimental data. Aggregate size distribution and the shape of resource profiles in a soil determine how hydration dynamics shape denitrification and carbon utilization rates. Results from the mechanistic model for microbial activity in aggregates of different sizes were used to derive parameters for analytical representation of soil biogeochemical processes across large scales of practical interest for hydrological and climate models.

Discovering novel and interesting spatio temporal patterns in sensor data is a major challenge in many scientific domains. Such data are often continuous, unbounded, and associated with high speed, time variant distribution with local and spatial trends. This paper presents a formalism that includes an extension of classical rough set inference mechanism to reason with space time variant data streams. The concept of multivalued decision systems has been used to account for multiple patterns in a single time window or snapshot. Such patterns or templates are incorporated in rough set based rule induction process. A framework for sensor data integration is illustrated by using a space time clustering mechanism followed by the generation of templates and local rules from such clusters. The multivalued decision system allows mining complex multiple patterns instead of a single value in a given template without requiring complex feature transformation. It also allows us to quantify and estimate potential data compression and associated uncertainty parameters. Finally, the results are validated and compared with other related algorithms. In general, the framework will help us understand the underlying reasoning mechanism about the ""part and whole"" or spatio temporal mereological relationship without sacrificing the semantics of the sensor data attributes."

This analysis proposes a general framework of studies that serves as support for future research on modularization strategy. To fulfill the proposed objective, a systematic literature review was conducted using 10 international academic journals and two Brazilian academic journals that publish studies on the study topic. The main results include identifying the lack of studies on the background that leads to modularization, the lack of empirical and quantitative studies on its effects, and the use of modularization in the organizational, service, and environmental contexts. The present study also organizes modularization studies in the proposed conceptual structure and classifies the articles analyzed into a specific modularization taxonomy and in terms of the study's objective.		26	3.257999897003174

Background: In modern complex socio technical systems, accidents are caused by a variety of contributing factors including human, technical, organizational, social factors, not by just a single violation or error of a specific actor, but accidents investigation used to be focused on the incorrect action of individuals. A new approach investigating causes of accidents as a symptom of a deficient system is required. Method: This study was mainly based on survey of literatures related to accidents, accidents investigation, which included academic journals, newspapers, etc. Results: This study showed that accidents investigation of Korea focusing on blaming is problematic. This was confirmed by two concepts of migration and hindsight bias frequently found in accident causation studies, and an attribute of accidents having varying causes. This was illustrated with an example of Sewol ferry capsizing accident. Representative systems based accident analysis models including Swiss cheese model, AcciMap, HFACS, FRAM and STAMP were briefly introduced, which can be used in systematic accidents investigations. Finally, this study proposed a procedure for establishing preventive measures of accidents, which was composed of two steps: public inquiry and devising preventive measures. Conclusion: A new approach considering how safety critical components such as technical and social elements, and their interactions lead to accidents is needed for preventing reoccurrence of similar accidents in complex socio technical systems. Application: The results would be used as a reference or guideline when the safety relevant governmental organizations investigate accidents.		1	0.0

The measured data have been applied to calculate, standard partial molar volume Hepler's constant apparent molar isentropic compressibility (Kph) transfer volume transfer compressibility and hydration number (nH) and used to discuss various solute solvent interactions. The transfer quantities are positive and increase with molalities of ionic liquid and decrease with temperature, indicating the dominance of hydrophilic hydrophilic interactions between the ionic liquid and acetaminophen, and dehydration effect of ionic liquid on the solutions. The limiting molar conductivities and ion association constants (Ka) for [OMIm]Br in aqueous acetaminophen solutions have been estimated using low concentration Chemical Model (lcCM) The Ka values were also used to obtain the thermodynamic functions of association process. Thermodynamic results show that the formation process of ion association of the ionic liquid has endothermic nature and is driven by the change in entropy.		2	0.6930000185966492

To achieve efficient authorized communication, multi server based authentication protocols have been designed. The key feature of multi server based protocols is one time registration. We study the existing multi server based authentication protocols, and identify that many of the multi server based authentication protocols involve control server in mutual authentication or trusted server environment is required. The involvement of central authority in mutual authentication may be a bottleneck for large network, and the servers may be semi trusted. To erase these drawbacks, Wei etzal. recently proposed a multi server based authentication protocol. Their protocol does not require all servers to be trusted and involvement of control server in mutual authentication. Unfortunately, we identify the security vulnerability of Wei etzal.'s scheme to insider attack and password guessing attack. Additionally, lack of pre smart card authentication leads to denial of service attack. To enhance the security of Wei etzal.'s protocol, we propose a secure biometric based authentication scheme for multi server environment using smart card. We simulate the proposed protocol for the formal security verification using the widely accepted AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to show that our scheme is secure against active and passive attacks. In addition, we prove that our proposed scheme provides mutual authentication using the widely accepted Burrows Abadi Needham (BAN) logic and is also secured against various well known attacks. In addition, our scheme is efficient in terms of computational and communication overheads as compared to Wei etzal.'s scheme and other existing related schemes.	J. Inf. Secur.

27	156367424	156367424	A Robust Two stage Data Envelopment Analysis Model for Measuring Efficiency: Considering Iranian Electricity Power Production and Distribution Processes	This paper presents a new robust two stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for efficiency evaluation of the electricity power production and distribution companies. DEA has been widely used for benchmarking the electricity companies. Traditional studies in DEA consider systems as a whole when measuring the efficiency, ignoring the operation of individual processes within a system. To tackle this issue, many works, aptly labeled Network DEA (NDEA) have been done to decompose the decision making units (DMU) overall efficiency. The two stage DEA model is a special variation which evaluates the efficiency of the DMUs having a two stage internal structure where the initial inputs are transformed to the intermediate outputs and intermediate outputs are developed into final output in the second stage. Conventional two stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) models require the exact data of inputs or outputs. However, in many real world applications this simple assumption does not hold. Recently, the robust optimization technique has been introduced for entering perturbation in the mathematical programming problem such as two stage DEA. This paper adopts this concept with the existing two stage DEA model. The implementation of the proposed method of this paper is applied for ranking different electricity power production and distribution companies in Iran		4	1.3860000371932983

Case Study Research on Labour Law Issues Arising from a Set of 'On Demand/Gig Economy' Platforms	"In the framework of the so called ""sharing economy"" the number of on demand companies matching labour supply and demand is on the rise. These schemes may enlarge opportunities for people willing to find a job or to top up their salaries. Despite the upsides of creating new peer marketplaces, these platforms may also be used to circumvent employment regulation, by operating informally in traditionally regulated markets.Literature showed how, by 2009, over 2 million worker accounts had been generated within these frameworks. Productivity may be fostered but, at the same time, a new version of Taylorism is disseminated (i.e. the fragmentation of labour into hyper temporary jobs they call them microtasks on a virtual assembly line) strengthened by globalisation and computerisation. All these intermediaries recruit freelance or casual workers (these continue to be independent contractors even though many indicators seem to reveal a disguised employment relationship).Uncertainty and insecurity are the price for extreme flexibility. A noteworthy volume of business risk is shifted to workers, and potential costs as benefits or unemployment insurance are avoided. Minimum wages are often far from being reached.This paper will present a case study analysis of several ""on demand work"" platforms, starting from the Amazon Mechanical Turk, one of the first schemes founded in 2005, which is arguably ""employing humans as a service"" It splits a single service in several micro ""Human Intelligence Tasks"" (such as tagging photographs, writing short descriptions, transcribing podcasts, processing raw data) ""Turkers/Providers"" (workers) are selected by ""Requesters"" to rapidly accomplish assignments online, are then rated according to an internal system and are finally paid (also in gaming credits) only if delivery is accepted. After having signed up and worked within some platforms, I comment upon TaskRabbit (thousands people on the service who bid to do simple manual tasks) Handy and Wonolo (personal assistance at a local level) oDesk and Freelancer (online staffing) Uber and Lyft (peer to peer ridesharing) Airbnb (hosting service) InnoCentive (engineering solutions) Axiom (legal research or service) BitWine (consultancy).Finally I highlight downsides and upsides of work in these platforms by studying terms of service or participation agreements to which both parties have to agree. I look into several key features such as (i) means of exchange/commodities, (ii) systems of payment, (iii) demographics, (iv) legal issues concerning status and statutory protection of workers, indicators of subordination, treatment of sickness, benefits and overtime, potential dispute resolution, and deprived ""moral valence of work"" and I discuss potential strategies to address these issues."		179	5.186999797821045
29	132261503	132261503	Peculiar features of the low latitude and midlatitude ionospheric response to the St. Patrick's Day geomagnetic storm of 17 March 2015	The current study aims at investigating and identifying the ionospheric effects of the geomagnetic storm that occurred during 17 19 March 2015. Incidentally, with SYM H hitting a minimum of 232 nT, this was the strongest storm of the current solar cycle 24. The study investigates how the storm has affected the equatorial, low latitude, and midlatitude ionosphere in the American and the European sectors using available ground based ionosonde and GPS TEC (total electron content) data. The possible effects of prompt electric field penetration is observed in both sectors during the main phase of the storm. In the American sector, the coexistence of both positive and negative ionospheric storm phases are observed at low latitudes and midlatitudes to high latitudes, respectively. The positive storm phase is mainly due to the prompt penetration electric fields. The negative storm phase in the midlatitude region is a combined effect of disturbance dynamo electric fields, the equatorward shift of the midlatitude density trough, and the equatorward compression of the plasmapause in combination with chemical compositional changes. Strong negative ionospheric storm phase is observed in both ionosonde and TEC observations during the recovery phase which also shows a strong hemispherical asymmetry. Additionally, the variation of equatorial ionization anomaly as seen through the SWARM constellation plasma measurements across different longitudes has been discussed. We, also, take a look at the performance of the IRI Real Time Assimilative Mapping during this storm as an ionospheric space weather tool.		57	4.043000221252441

Patients were classified according to six molecular subtypes: luminal A (hormone receptor [HR]/HER2 /Ki 67 15% n=113) luminal B1 (HR+/HER2 /Ki 67 15% n=33) luminal B2 (HR+/HER2+ n=83) HER2 with trastuzumab (HER2[T+ (HR /HER2+/use of trastuzumab, n=14) HER2 without trastuzumab (HER2[T (HR /HER2+ n=31) and triple negative (TN) (HR /HER2 n=61) Results After a median follow up period of 7.2 years, 26 IBTRs and 37 LRRs occurred. The 5 year LRR free survival rates were luminal A, 96.4% B1, 93.9% B2, 90.3% HER2(T+ 92.9% HER2(T 78.3% and TN, 79.6% The 5 year IBTR free survival rates were luminal A, 97.2% B1, 93.9% B2, 92.8% HER2(T+ 92.9% HER2(T 89.1% and TN, 84.6% In multivariate analysis, HER2(T (IBTR: hazard ratio, 4.2; p=0.04 and LRR: hazard ratio, 7.6; p 0.01) and TN subtypes (IBTR: hazard ratio, 6.9; p=0.01 and LRR: hazard ratio, 8.1; p 0.01) were associated with higher IBTR and LRR rates. A pathologic complete response (pCR) was found to show correlation with better LRR and a tendency toward improved IBTR controls in TN patients (IBTR, p=0.07; LRR, p=0.03) Conclusion The TN and HER2(T subtypes predict higher rates of IBTR and LRR after NAC and BCT. A pCR is predictive of improved IBTR or LRR in TN subtype.	Cancer research and treatment official journal of Korean Cancer Association	36	3.5840001106262207
31	44246827	44246827	Poster: Comparative study of EM MAC and TSCH/orchestra for IoT	Multichannel Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for IoT can potentially improve network performance. Therefore, a considerable number of such protocols have been proposed in the last decade, ranging from slotted synchronous to contention based asynchronous multichannel protocols. In this paper two of the most representative multichannel MAC layer protocols are compared: Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) using the Orchestra scheduling algorithm, and Energy Efficient Multichannel MAC (EM MAC) The performance of these protocols is assessed under different traffic loads and node densities using the standard IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) i.e. RPL. The results show the cross layer interaction between the RPL protocol and the multichannel MAC schemes under study. Moreover, it can be generally appreciated that TSCH/Orchestra performs better in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) whereas EM MAC exhibits lower power consumption. These characteristics reveal the suitability of these protocols for different IoT applications.	2016 Symposium on Communications and Vehicular Technologies (SCVT)	4	1.3860000371932983

It delivers an improved solution in two ways compared with other vision based methods. On the one hand, current techniques regard depression recognition as either a classification or a regression problem, which tends to incur overfitting due to the high complexity of the model and the limited number of training samples. To handle such an issue, we propose a two stage framework consisting of a coarse classifier and a fine regressor. The former makes use of a set of linear functions, corresponding to different depression intensities, to approximate the complex non linear model, where a coarse range of the test sample is preliminarily located. The latter then predicts its precise depression level within the given range. On the other hand, depression recognition is different from the general classification and regression tasks, since its analysis is cost sensitive as the diagnosis of heart diseases and cancers. However, this critical cue is not taken into account in the previous investigations, thus making their results problematic. To address this drawback, we embed the indicator of medical risk assessment into both the two stages by constraining the classifier using a weight matrix and loosening the regressor to an expanded range of depression level. The proposed method is evaluated on the Audio and Video Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2013, and the performance is superior to the best one so far reported using the visual modality. Furthermore, it proves complementary to the audio based methods, and their joint use further ameliorates the accuracy. These facts clearly highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method on depression recognition.	ACCV	6	1.7920000553131104

Forty eight 4 to 5 year olds were individually interviewed via a SFON Imitation Task and a numerical picture book reading activity. We expected differences in the frequency of number related utterances during picture book reading between children with a higher SFON score, providing more number related utterances, and children with a lower SFON score. Our results showed large inter individual differences in both kindergartners' SFON and the frequency of their number related utterances during picture book reading, yet SFON was not related to the frequency of number related utterances. This unexpected result is discussed in terms of its scientific, methodological, and educational implications.		19	2.944000005722046
34	59055478	59055478	The ecology of cooperative learning in a high school physical education Pprogramme	The purpose of this study was to describe and interpret the ecology of cooperative learning as an instructional model in two high school physical education classes. One eighth grade (year 9) and one eleventh grade (year 12) class and their teacher were observed during a ten lesson team handball unit. The following research questions framed the study (a) What were the curricular and organizational characteristics of the handball units? (b) How was the content organized and presented through the instructional tasks? and (c) What were the students' motor responses during the physical education content? A modified version of the task structure observational instrument was used to systematically observe 20 physical education classes (Siedentop, 1994) The ecological analysis demonstrated that both classes had low management time, high engagement time, and a large number of refinements tasks. Students in both classes performed a high number of opportunities to respond in both practice and game situations. Much of the accountability for student performance in managerial and instructional tasks was embedded within the cooperative learning tasks. In addition, the student social system contributed to work in the managerial and instructional task system. Cognitive tasks, which appeared in every lesson, contributed to the students' understanding of the content and contributed to their selection and implementation of appropriate skills and strategies in the games. Cooperative Learning appears to be a viable instructional model for teaching quality high school physical education.		17	2.8329999446868896

There are two way to improve farms competitiveness: dimensional growth, achievable through the horizontal aggregation of producers (POs) and innovation, achievable through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) Although several studies have pointed out the positive influence of ICT tools on SMEs performances growth, there is a lack of works concerning the way POs use ICTs web based in order to improve innovativeness and competitiveness of their small farmers. After a preliminary literature review regarding the main drivers for the adoption of ICT and technological innovations in agriculture, an exploratory analysis was performed through a set of in depth interviews to opinion leaders in associated farms of a PO. This qualitative methodological approach aims to investigate the POs contribution in enhancing process or product innovation, improving competitiveness and transferring knowledge, among the associated farms through the use of ICT tools. Findings confirm the main hypothesis on which this study is based upon and are supported by theoretical implications shown in the literature review.		2	0.6930000185966492

As modern design methods using Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have been increasingly adopted by the AEC industry, construction quality assessment using BIM has become a challenging new task for practitioners. In the past few years, 3D as built models for construction quality assessment have been developed using data acquisition techniques like 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry. However, certain limitations like non affordability, requiring expertise to operate, and dependence on time consuming processes are restricting their usage for construction quality control purposes. The main objective of this work is to study the applicability of using a new, affordable, easy to use, and faster modeling technology (Project Tango) to produce 3D as built models for facilitating the construction quality control process. For this purpose, a construction project was chosen as a case study and three different scenarios (including interior and exterior environments) were modelled using Project Tango. A post processing method was developed to prepare the scanned as built models for comparison with the design BIM. The accuracy level of these as built models were also evaluated using dimension accuracy analysis. The prepared as built models and the design BIM were then integrated and adjusted in the Autodesk Navisworks environment to perform the quality control assessment. This assessment process includes object completeness testing and spatial deviation analyses. This research thus highlights both the advantages and limitations of Project Tango and shows that such technologies have a great potential for construction quality assessments.		31	3.434000015258789

IntroductionThe use of corticosteroids to reduce the post operative sequelae of lower third molar surgery, namely pain, swelling and trismus, has been well studied by many researchers over the past 6 decades. This study reviewed the reported outcome of corticosteroids used in controlling the above sequalae after third molar surgery.Materials and MethodsA PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Google search was undertaken of all controlled clinical trials on the effects of corticosteroids on pain, swelling and trismus after lower third molar surgery. The review was limited to studies published over the last 10 years (2006 2015).ResultsOf the 46 initially retrieved articles, 34 were finally included. Eleven studies compared the effect of 2 similar (but different dose) or different group of corticosteroids. Thirty one studies reported the effects of corticosteroids on all sequale, 2 reported the outcome on swelling and trismus and another 1 on swelling and pain only. In 16 of the studies, corticosteroid use resulted in significant reductions in pain after third molar removal. Twenty two out of 29 studies reported reduced swelling against negative control while 18 out of 25 studies reported improved mouth opening. Fourteen studies reported the benefit of corticosteroids on all 3 sequelae, with 71.4% resulted from the use of methylprednisolone.ConclusionAlthough there are some conflicting effects, the results of this analysis shows in general the benefits derived from short term use of corticosteroids in relation to pain, swelling and trismus following third molar surgical extraction, with no side effects observed.FundingThis work was supported by the University of Malaya's High Impact Research grant UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/05.

Pegvisomant and dopamine agonists are alternatives, which are used to a lesser extent. Dopamine agonists are the only orally applicable medication but are less effective than the other options. For a large number of patients, life long pharmacotherapy has to be applied and frequent injections represent a reduction of quality of life for many of them. Areas covered: Recently published evidence for the use of oral octreotide therapy for acromegaly. Expert commentary: Oral octreotide is a novel and effective treatment for acromegaly and the side effects have been shown to be comparable to the injectable SSAs. The combination with a transient permeability enhancer allows intestinal permeation but also enables molecules with a size <70 kDa to pass transiently. This does not seem to have an acute or subacute consequence, but the long term effect is still elusive. Therefore, more long term trials are desirable.	Expert review of endocrinology metabolism	1	0.0

The stateof the art models for this problem have either applied convolutional neural networks in a pipelined framework (Chen et al. 2015) or followed the joint architecture via structured prediction with rich local and global features (Li et al. 2013) The former is able to learn hidden feature representations automatically from data based on the continuous and generalized representations of words. The latter, on the other hand, is capable of mitigating the error propagation problem of the pipelined approach and exploiting the inter dependencies between event triggers and argument roles via discrete structures. In this work, we propose to do event extraction in a joint framework with bidirectional recurrent neural networks, thereby benefiting from the advantages of the two models as well as addressing issues inherent in the existing approaches. We systematically investigate different memory features for the joint model and demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the state of the art performance on the ACE 2005 dataset.

When looking at teaching and learning processes in mathematics education students with mathematical learning difficulties or disabilities are of great interest. To approach the question of how research can support practice to assist these students one has to clarify the group or groups of students that we are talking about. The following contribution firstly concentrates on the problem of labelling the group of students having mathematical difficulties as there does not exist a single definition. This problem might be put down to the different roots of mathematics education on the one hand and special education on the other hand. Research results with respect to concepts and models for instruction are multifaceted based on the specific content and mathematical topics as well as the underlying view of mathematics. Taking into account inclusive education, a closer orientation to mathematical education can be identified and the potential of selected teaching and learning concepts can be illustrated. Beyond this, the role of the teacher, their attitudes and beliefs and the corresponding teacher education programs are discussed.		46	3.8289999961853027

Among various sources of uncertainty, precipitation plays a particular role. Rainfall rates as the main input data of RRS are of the first factors controlling the accuracy. In addition to the depth, spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall impact the flood discharge. Most of the previous studies on RRS uncertainty have ignored rainfall spatial distribution, where in large catchments, it is necessary to be modeled explicitly. Karoon III is one most important basin of the Iran because of the Karoon III dam in the outlet. In the present work, effect of spatial correlation of rainfall on HEC HMS (SMA) continuous RRS uncertainty is evaluated using 2variate copula (2copula) Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approach was used to consider the rainfall spatial dependence. To reduce the computational expense, sampling efficiency and convergence for MCS, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was used. Copula functions consider wide range of marginal probability distribution functions (PDFs) eliminating limits of regular join PDFs. For this aim, two scenarios were investigated. In the first scenario, sub basin rainfall was considered independent, and in the second scenario, 2copula was adopted to model spatial correlation of rainfall. Dimensionless rainfall depths were calculated for each sub basin, and the PDFs were determined. The generated random dimensionless rainfalls were reweighted and multiplied by watershed's mean rainfall value. Stochastic Climate Library was used to generate continuous daily rainfalls. Sampling from dimensionless rainfalls using LHS algorithm, 100 runs of calibrated model simulated 100 flows for each day following MCS, and 80 certainty bound was calculated. Results showed that considering dependence decreased 18 of the maximum uncertainty bound width, so the methodology could be recommended for decreasing predicted runoff error.

43	3437207	3437207	Vessel co option mediates resistance to anti angiogenic therapy in liver metastases	The efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer is limited by resistance mechanisms that are poorly understood. Notably, instead of through the induction of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic mechanism of vessel co option. Here we show that vessel co option is associated with a poor response to the anti angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co option is also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which results with anti angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the actin related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co option in liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co option is more effective than the inhibition of angiogenesis alone. Vessel co option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to anti angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy.

However, in a boundary conduction mode (BCM) boost PFC, the current flowing through the input filter capacitor becomes a main cause due to its large ripple current. Despite that, there has not been any effort to compensate the current in the input filter capacitor (IFC) in a BCM boost PFC. In this paper, a new digital control method is proposed to compensate PLIC in a BCM boost PFC, by minimizing the effect of the IFC. The proposed method uses only the derivative of the input voltage, without any additional component. Also, the proposed method improves the displacement factor, but does not affect the distortion factor, resulting in a high power quality in the entire input and output conditions. The derivation of the proposed method is presented based on time domain analysis, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified with a 60 Hz, 90 230 Vrms input and 395 V/0.5 A output prototype.

Free positioning of a plane receiving (Rx) coil is obtained for an arbitrary direction within 1m from a plane transmission (Tx) coil. Both the Tx and Rx coils consists of crossed dipole coils with an orthogonal phase difference; hence, a rotating magnetic field is generated from the Tx, which enables the Rx to receive power vertically or horizontally. Thus, the 3 D omnidirectional IPT is first realized for both the plate type Tx and Rx coils, which is crucial for practical applications, where volumetric coil structure is highly prohibited. This optimized configuration of coils has been obtained through a general classification of power transfer and searching for mathematical constraints on multi D omnidirectional IPT. Conventional loop coils are thoroughly analyzed, and verified to be inadequate for the plate type omnidirectional IPT in this paper.

46	4669377	4669377	Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Temporal Abstraction and Intrinsic Motivation	Learning goal directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical DQN (h DQN) a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'	NIPS	681	6.52400016784668

The consumption of high nutritional value snacks may favorably affect the diet quality. Biscuits manufactured with oat flakes and maltitol were assessed for glycemic, insulinemic and ghrelin responses. Enrichment with inulin, a fructooligosachararide (FOS) which acts as soluble fiber, was performed in an attempt to further increase the dietary fiber content and examine potential additional postprandial benefits. Eleven healthy subjects participated in the study and consumed either 80 g oat biscuits (OB) or 81 g oat biscuits with 4% inulin (OBIN) or a solution containing 50 g of glucose (reference food) each yielding 50 g of available carbohydrates. Venous blood samples were collected before consumption and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min postprandially. The developed products were also evaluated for physicochemical properties, including porosity, density, texture, color, sensory attributes and microstructure (by scanning electron microscopy) Both biscuits demonstrated a low glycemic index (GI) which was found to be 32.82 8.07 for OB and 45.68 9.64 for OBIN. Compared to OB, OBIN demonstrated higher insulin response at 45 and 60 min and higher ghrelin suppression at 60 and 120 min postprandially (P 0.05) Furthermore, OBIN demonstrated increased hardness and color values, lower porosity, and higher rate of starch granule gelatinization, without significantly altering the sensory attributes. Biscuits formulated with oat flakes and maltitol with or without 4% inulin can be classified as low GI foods. Inulin addition significantly lowered the ghrelin response to OBIN, suggesting an advantage of OBIN in the modulation of satiety; however, no further benefits regarding glucose and insulin responses were observed.

Considering the presence of an eavesdropper that overhears the transmission, we address secure communications of multi hop wireless communications in terms of physical layer security. In addition, we take in to account the effect of imperfect channel state information (CSI) which is of importance issue in underlay cognitive radio. We analyze the secrecy outage performance of the system over Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, we derive the closed form expression of the system secrecy outage probability. The analysis results are validated by the Monte Carlo simulation results. The numerical results show that the imperfect CSI issue does not effect on the security issue of the transmission in underlay cognitive radio networks. On the other hand, the number of hops plays a key role in the physical layer security.	2016 International Conference on Electronics, Information, and Communications (ICEIC)	16	2.7730000019073486

A trusted data curator can increase the utility of data, while managing the risk to establishments, either by releasing synthetic data, or by infusing noise into published statistics. This paper evaluates the application of a differentially private mechanism to publish statistics on wages and job mobility computed from Brazilian employer employee matched data. The publication mechanism can result in both the publication of specific statistics as well as the generation of synthetic data. I find that the tradeoff between the privacy guaranteed to individuals in the data, and the accuracy of published statistics, is poten tially much better that the worst case theoretical accuracy guarantee. However, the synthetic data fare quite poorly in analyses that are outside the set of queries to which it was trained. Note that this article only explores and characterizes the feasibility of these publication strategies, and will not directly result in the publication of any data.		2	0.6930000185966492

Unlike previous methods, our network jointly learns the attribute's features, localization, and ranker. The localization module of our network discovers the most informative image region for the attribute, which is then used by the ranking module to learn a ranking model of the attribute. Our end to end framework also significantly speeds up processing and is much faster than previous methods. We show state of the art ranking results on various relative attribute datasets, and our qualitative localization results clearly demonstrate our network's ability to learn meaningful image patches.

56	15875928	15875928	On the adoption of the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) in DNSSEC	The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are steadily being deployed across the Internet. DNSSEC extends the DNS protocol with two vital security properties, authenticity and integrity, using digital signatures. While DNSSEC is meant to solve security issues in the DNS, it also introduces a new one: the digital signatures significantly increase DNS packet sizes, making DNSSEC an attractive vector to abuse in amplification denial of service attacks. By default, DNSSEC uses RSA for digital signatures. Earlier work has shown that alternative signature schemes, based on elliptic curve cryptography, can significantly reduce the impact of signatures on DNS response sizes. In this paper we study the actual adoption of ECDSA by DNSSEC operators, based on longitudinal datasets covering over 50% of the global DNS namespace over a period of 1.5 years. Adoption is still marginal, with just 2.3% of DNSSEC signed domains in the .com TLD using ECDSA. Nevertheless, use of ECDSA is growing, with at least one large operator leading the pack. And adoption could be up to 42% higher. As we demonstrate, there are barriers to deployment that hamper adoption. Operators wishing to deploy DNSSEC using current recommendations (with ECDSA as signing algorithm) must be mindful of this when planning their deployment.	2016 12th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)	19	2.944000005722046

AIChE Journal 34, 2069 2072, 1988) The model was next validated against the gas holdup radial profile data for N2 Drakeol glass beads system obtained in a 0.44 m ID and 2.44 m height reactor, including internals, operating under ambient conditions at various superficial gas velocities by Chen et al. (Fluid dynamic parameters in bubble columns with internals. Chemical Engineering Science 54, 2187 2197, 1999) The model was also validated against experimental data obtained in our lab for N2 Fischer Tropsch (F T) reactor wax Fe catalyst system obtained in a pilot scale, Slurry Bubble column Reactor, SBCR (0.29 m ID, 3 m height) under pressures and temperatures up to 25.9 bar and 490 K, respectively. These three validations led to the selection of the turbulence and interphase drag coefficient models, and the optimization of the solution method, mesh size and structure and the step size. Moreover, the inclusion of RNG k e turbulence model coupled with the Wen Yu (Mechanics of Fluidization.

Ing 77, 318 320, 1935) drag correlations, and the mass transfer coefficients were found to provide the most accurate predictions of the experimental data. The CFD model was then used to investigate local gas holdup, liquid recirculation, local turbulence intensities, bubble diameters, and solids distribution throughout our pilot scale SBCR, operating under typical F T process conditions. The model predictions showed strong liquid recirculation and backmixing near the walls of the reactor, and the solid phase velocity vectors closely followed those of the liquid phase. A relatively high liquid turbulence intensities were observed in the vicinity of the sparger upon startup, however, after reaching a steady state, the liquid turbulence intensities became more evenly distributed throughout the reactor. The liquid turbulence intensities were slightly higher near the center of the reactor, and closely resembled the velocity vectors. Also, the Sauter mean bubble diameters increased, whereas the solids distribution decreased with reactor height above the gas distributor.		14	2.6389999389648438

"For 30 years two general mechanisms have competed to explain somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. The first, the DNA based model, is focused only on DNA substrates. The modern form is the Neuberger ""DNA Deamination Model"" based on activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and short patch error prone DNA repair by DNA Polymerase e operating around AID C to U lesions. The other is an RNA based mechanism or the ""Reverse Transcriptase Model"" of SHM which produces strand biased mutations at A:T and G:C base pairs. This involves error prone cDNA synthesis via an RNA dependent DNA polymerase copying the Ig pre mRNA template and integrating the now error filled cDNA copy back into the normal chromosomal site. The modern form of this mechanism depends on AID dC to dU lesions and long tract error prone cDNA synthesis of the transcribed strand by DNA Polymerase e acting as a reverse transcriptase. The evidence for and against each mechanism is critically evaluated. The conclusion is that all the SHM molecular data gathered since 1980 supports directly or indirectly the RNA/RT based mechanism. All the data and critical analyses are systematically laid out so the reader can evaluate this conclusion for themselves. Recently we have investigated whether similar RNA/RT based mutator mechanisms explain how de novo mutations arise in somatic tissues (cancer genomes) The data analyses indeed suggest that cancers arise via dysregulated ""Ig like SHM responses"" involving rogue DNA and RNA deaminations coupled to genome wide RT events. Further, Robyn Lindley has recently shown that the strand biased mutations in cancer genome genes are also in ""codon context."" This has been termed Targeted Somatic Mutation (TSM) to highlight that mutations are far more targeted than previously thought in somatic tissues associated with disease. The TSM process implies an ""in frame DNA reader"" whereby DNA and RNA deaminases at transcribed regions are guided in their mutagenic action, by the codon reading frame of the DNA."

To extract proper input data for these tasks from the sensor, several sensor data preprocessing algorithms are first addressed. For the simultaneous localization and mapping problem, we propose a local volumetric hybrid map based approach using Rao Blackwellized particle filters. We represent the static environments with the hybrid map consisting of feature and 3 D grid maps. This framework basically allows us to utilize the traditional approaches using a single map. In addition, we derive a new sampling formula by combining a feature measurement likelihood to the traditional grid map based approach, and this significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed moving object tracking algorithm is achieved based on the geometric and multiple motion models. We introduce a robust extraction and parameterization method of the geometric shape based on predefined contour models. Then, the geometric shape is inferred with a multiple base point method. We establish three motion models, which are utilized for tracking in an adaptive way by using the well known interacting multiple model algorithm. The algorithms proposed are evaluated using the data sets collected from our test vehicle in the complex urban scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach works well even in real outdoor environments and outperforms traditional approaches.

Unlike in previous works, we do not impose boundedness of the vertex degree, nor do we restrict ourselves to the normalized Laplacian and, more generally, we do not impose any boundedness assumption on the geometry. This is achieved by a novel definition of the measure of the boundary which uses the idea of intrinsic metrics. For the non normalized case, our bounds on the spectral gap of p Laplacians are already significantly better for finite graphs and for infinite graphs they yield non trivial bounds even in the case of unbounded vertex degree. We, furthermore, give upper bounds by the Cheeger constant and by the exponential volume growth of distance balls.		18	2.890000104904175

The EGLT explicates students' thinking and learning over time in relation to a set of tasks and activities developed to engender a view of exponential growth as a relation between two continuously covarying quantities. Developed out of two teaching experiments with early adolescents, the EGLT identifies three major stages of students' conceptual development: prefunctional reasoning, the covariation view, and the correspondence view. The learning trajectory is presented along with three individual students' progressions through the trajectory as a way to illustrate the variation present in how the participants made sense of ideas about exponential growth.		33	3.496999979019165

Transit Oriented Development (TOD) principles are expected to substantially contribute towards achieving accessible, affordable and comfortable public transport services for low density Australian communities. From the point of view of comparative infrastructure development, timeframe and costs, bus based TOD systems (BTODs) seem to be more appropriate than rail based TOD systems (RTODs) in the Australian context, where bus based transport routes already play a significant role in the overall transportation system of some cities. Transit passenger densities in corridor catchments of low medium density suburban environments are better suited to buses than light or heavy rail transit which require large commuter volumes. Buses also offer greater flexibility supporting feeder services in addition to serving trunk routes, and potentially have a much greater reach beyond high passenger density transit corridors. This paper investigates and formulates policies on how bus based transit can be used in achieving transit oriented development through successfully implementing TOD principles with bus transit within the context of Australian cities. This paper will analyse existing land use and demographic data along a bus route on a suburban arterial road to identify the suitability of the land for higher density developments that would potentially make the transformation of a bus route into a transit corridor viable. The selection criteria in undertaking land suitability analysis to achieve 'concentrated densities around the nodes' will also be discussed. The findings of this research will be of value in developing a methodology for undertaking an extensive demographic and land use analysis for the purposes of developing a BTOD model to transition low density, car dependent Australian cities towards more transit oriented and environmentally sustainable urban environments.		3	1.0989999771118164

IMPORTANCE Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) has not been rigorously evaluated for young and middle aged adults with chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness for chronic low back pain of MBSR vs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or usual care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, interviewer blind, clinical trial in an integrated health care system in Washington State of 342 adults aged 20 to 70 years with chronic low back pain enrolled between September 2012 and April 2014 and randomly assigned to receive MBSR (n 116) CBT (n 113) or usual care (n 113) INTERVENTIONS CBT (training to change pain related thoughts and behaviors) and MBSR (training in mindfulness meditation and yoga) were delivered in 8 weekly 2 hour groups. Usual care included whatever care participants received. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary outcomes were the percentages of participants with clinically meaningful =30% improvement from baseline in functional limitations (modified Roland Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] range, 0 23) and in self reported back pain bothersomeness (scale, 0 10) at 26 weeks. Outcomes were also assessed at 4, 8, and 52 weeks. RESULTS There were 342 randomized participants, the mean (SD) [range] age was 49.3 (12.3) [20 70] years, 224 (65.7% were women, mean duration of back pain was 7.3 years (range, 3 months 50 years) 123 (53.7% attended 6 or more of the 8 sessions, 294 (86.0% completed the study at 26 weeks, and 290 (84.8% completed the study at 52 weeks. In intent to treat analyses at 26 weeks, the percentage of participants with clinically meaningful improvement on the RDQ was higher for those who received MBSR (60.5% and CBT (57.7% than for usual care (44.1% (overall P .04; relative risk [RR] for MBSR vs usual care, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.06 1.77] RR for MBSR vs CBT, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.77 1.18] and RR for CBT vs usual care, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.01 1.69] The percentage of participants with clinically meaningful improvement in pain bothersomeness at 26 weeks was 43.6% in the MBSR group and 44.9% in the CBT group, vs 26.6% in the usual care group (overall P .01; RR for MBSR vs usual care, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.15 2.34] RR for MBSR vs CBT, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.78 1.36] and RR for CBT vs usual care, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.18 2.41] Findings for MBSR persisted with little change at 52 weeks for both primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with chronic low back pain, treatment with MBSR or CBT, compared with usual care, resulted in greater improvement in back pain and functional limitations at 26 weeks, with no significant differences in outcomes between MBSR and CBT. These findings suggest that MBSR may be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic low back pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01467843.

A variety of naturally formed bioactive peptides have been found in fermented dairy products such as yogurt, sour milk, and cheese. Initially these peptides are inactive within the sequence of the parent protein molecule and can be generated by gastrointestinal digestion of milk, fermentation of milk with proteolytic starter cultures, and/or hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes. Milk derived peptides exert a number of health beneficial activities, even upon oral administration. Bioactive peptides have a great impact on major body systems including the digestive, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, diabetes type II, obesity, and immune systems. Antimicrobial peptides are also an important ingredient of innate immunity, especially at mucosal surfaces such as lungs and small intestine that are constantly exposed to a range of potential pathogens. Therefore, it plays an important role in boosting natural immune protection by reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Bioactive peptides are considered as potent drugs with well defined pharmacological residues and also used to formulate health enhancing nutraceuticals.		72	4.2769999504089355

Analog bandwidth of DACs is one of the major limiting factors for the system capacity. In this paper, we present an idea to extend the analog bandwidth of DACs by utilizing a digital preprocessor, two sub DACs, and an analog multiplexer (AMUX) The AMUX is a high speed linear selector, and a frequency domain interpretation of the AMUX's function has led us to devise the digital preprocessing for a seamless extension of the analog bandwidth. This configuration, which we call a digital preprocessed analog multiplexed DAC, provides nearly doubled analog bandwidth compared to that of each subDAC with a symmetric configuration. The idea was verified by a transmission experiment with 160 Gb/s 80 Gbaud Nyquist four level pulse amplitude modulation. In the experiment, we used subDACs with an analog bandwidth of ~20 GHz in combination with an AMUX fabricated with InP heterojunction bipolar transistor technology.

Filter material after lamination porosity is high and pore size is small, the average pole diameter is around 2.3mm which is 1/10 of that after impregnation, so surface filtering is easily formed. The laminated filter material can effectively withhold the yardstick of microscopic dust micron. Attachments on the surface of composite filter material fiber noticeably increased, surface density and thickness of composite filter material all increased slightly after emulsion impregnation treatment which can increase the filter material strength under normal conditions. The pressure loss of lamination filter material is higher than that of impregnation filter material. Lamination filter material has higher filtering classification efficiency for fine particles. Impregnation is conducive to enhance the strength of the filter. Two kinds of modified filter materials have good resistance to acids, but break in 85degC and alkali conditions, strength retention disappears entirely. The study provided a reference for the stable and efficient application of modified filter material in the dust removal field.		1	0.0

Methods In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika. By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations. Findings We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95% credible interval, CrI: 4.4 7.6) with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95% CrI: 7.6 18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95% CrI: 7.0 11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CrI: 6.9 21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10 000 for every 1 per 100 000 person days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% CrI: 0.89 0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR: 0.71; 95% CrI: 0.28 0.88) Conclusion Neither symptom nor antibody based screening for Zika virus infection substantially reduced the risk that blood donations would be contaminated by the virus. Polymerase chain reaction testing should be considered for identifying blood safe for use in pregnant women in high incidence areas.	Bulletin of the World Health Organization	74	4.303999900817871

76	3261604	3261604	The anatomical and functional specialization of the fusiform gyrus	The fusiform gyrus (FG) is commonly included in anatomical atlases and is considered a key structure for functionally specialized computations of high level vision such as face perception, object recognition, and reading. However, it is not widely known that the FG has a contentious history. In this review, we first provide a historical analysis of the discovery of the FG and why certain features, such as the mid fusiform sulcus, were discovered and then forgotten. We then discuss how observer independent methods for identifying cytoarchitectonical boundaries of the cortex revolutionized our understanding of cytoarchitecture and the correspondence between those boundaries and cortical folding patterns of the FG. We further explain that the co occurrence between cortical folding patterns and cytoarchitectonical boundaries are more common than classically thought and also, are functionally meaningful especially on the FG and probably in high level visual cortex more generally. We conclude by proposing a series of alternatives for how the anatomical organization of the FG can accommodate seemingly different theoretical aspects of functional processing, such as domain specificity and perceptual expertise.

Preventing transmission from virally unsuppressed men who have condomless anal sex (CAS) with serodiscordant partners is a public health imperative. New HIV infections in GBMSM are attributed in part to online access to sex partners; therefore, low cost eHealth interventions are a unique opportunity to reach men where they meet partners. Objective To describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial evaluating whether video based messaging delivered online may lead to reductions in serodiscordant CAS and increased HIV disclosure. Methods Sex Positive! is a two arm, phase III, video based randomized controlled trial delivered online to GBMSM living with HIV. Participants in the intervention arm receive 10 video vignettes grounded in social learning and social cognitive theories that are designed to elicit critical thinking around issues of HIV transmission and disclosure. Participants in the attention control arm receive 10 video vignettes that focus on healthy living. All videos are optimized for mobile viewing. The study protocol includes five online assessments conducted over a 1 year period among 1500 US white, black, or Hispanic/Latino GBMSM living with HIV who report suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence or a detectable viral load in the past 12 months and recent CAS (past 6 months) with HIV negative or unknown status male partners. Compared to the control arm, we hypothesize that men who watch the intervention videos will report at 12 month follow up significantly fewer serodiscordant CAS partners, increased HIV disclosure, and improved social cognition (eg, condom use self efficacy, perceived responsibility) Results Participant recruitment began in June 2015 and ended in December 2015. Conclusions This protocol describes the underlying theoretical framework and measures, study design, recruitment challenges, and antifraud measures for an online, video based randomized controlled trial that has the potential to decrease HIV transmission risk behaviors among HIV positive GBMSM who struggle with ART adherence. The Sex Positive! intervention allows for participation through multiple Internet based mediums and has the potential to reach and engage a broader population of HIV positive GBMSM who are virally unsuppressed.

The concept was examined for the case of Greece. Two distinct case studies were selected, regarding the entity that makes the investment in PtM: a) the power plant owner case and b) the private investor case. The study focused on the estimation of the MeOH cost for a marginally feasible investment by fulfilling techno economic criteria. In the case of the power plant owner the MeOH cost was estimated at 421EUR/tn MeOH and was about 40% lower than the cost calculated for the private investor case (580EUR/tn MeOH) due to the higher operating capacity of the H2 and MeOH plants and the lower electricity cost in the first case. The MeOH cost was further decreased in both cases by considering: a) large plant scales, b) low electricity cost, c) high operating time for the H2 and MeOH plants, d) low CO2 costs and/or e) low discount rates. Following the results for Greece, the power plant owner case was also examined for Germany and proved to be even more sustainable, due to the lower electricity cost in Germany.		38	3.638000011444092

Solid solutions of magnesium silicide and magnesium stannide were recently reported to have high thermoelectric figure of merits (ZT) due to remarkably low thermal conductivity, which was conjectured to come from phonon scattering by segregated Mg2Si and Mg2Sn phases without detailed study. However, it is essential to identify the main cause for further improving ZT as well as estimating its upper bound. Here we synthesized Mg2(Si,Sn) with nanoparticles and segregated phases, and theoretically analyzed and estimated the thermal conductivity upon segregated fraction and extraneous nanoparticle addition by fitting experimentally obtained thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. In opposition to the previous speculation that segregated phases intensify phonon scattering, we found that lattice thermal conductivity was increased by the phase segregation, which is difficult to avoid due to the miscibility gap. We selected extraneous TiO2 nanoparticles dissimilar to the host materials as additives to reduce lattice thermal conductivity. Our experimental results showed the maximum ZT was improved from ~0.9 without the nanoparticles to ~1.1 with 2 and 5 vol TiO2 nanoparticles at 550 degC. According to our theoretical analysis, this ZT increase by the nanoparticle addition mainly comes from suppressed lattice thermal conductivity in addition to lower bipolar thermal conductivity at high temperatures. The upper bound of ZT was predicted to be ~1.8 for the ideal case of no phase segregation and addition of 5 vol TiO2 nanoparticles. We believe this study offers a new direction toward improved thermoelectric performance of Mg2(Si,Sn)	ACS applied materials interfaces	30	3.4010000228881836

Saturated concentration of rock salt in water is determined by a simulation of brine in contact with a crystal in the slab geometry. The NaCl crystals are rotated to expose facets with higher Miller indices than [001] to brine. The rock salt melting point is obtained by both the standard and adiabatic simulations in the slab geometry with attention paid to finite size effects as well as to a possible influence of facets with higher Miller indices and applied stress. Two force fields are used, the Lennard Jones based model by Young and Cheatham with SPC/E water and the Kiss and Baranyai polarizable model with BK3 water. The latter model is refitted to thermomechanical properties of crystal NaCl leading to better values of solubility and the melting point.	The Journal of chemical physics	32	3.4660000801086426

In the big data era, these data become impossible to be stored anymore, so simultaneous analysis of these data is strongly demanded. In order to realize such an on the fly intuitive analysis of simulation, this paper showcases a multimodal visualization and steering system with visual and haptic interfaces for a real time GPU based coupled fluid structure simulation. Since the nature of touching sense of human beings requires extremely fast and continuous refreshing to form authentic feeling, parallel techniques were utilized to speed up haptic updating to around one millisecond. A middle layer interface for a haptic device was developed to realize the ease of use of this device. Furthermore, a model of palpation was proposed to allow users to touch, push and sense the dynamic fluid motion inside a deformable tube.	2016 IEEE/ACIS 15th International Conference on Computer and Information Science (ICIS)	7	1.9459999799728394

Xenacoelomorpha, comprising Acoela, Nemertodermatida, and Xenoturbella, are bilaterally symmetrical marine worms that lack several features common to most other bilaterians, for example an anus, nephridia, and a circulatory system. Two conflicting hypotheses are under debate: Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group to all remaining Bilateria Nephrozoa, namely protostomes and deuterostomes) or is a clade inside Deuterostomia. Thus, determining the phylogenetic position of this clade is pivotal for understanding the early evolution of bilaterian features, or as a case of drastic secondary loss of complexity. Here we show robust phylogenomic support for Xenacoelomorpha as the sister taxon of Nephrozoa. Our phylogenetic analyses, based on 11 novel xenacoelomorph transcriptomes and using different models of evolution under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, strongly corroborate this result. Rigorous testing of 25 experimental data sets designed to exclude data partitions and taxa potentially prone to reconstruction biases indicates that long branch attraction, saturation, and missing data do not influence these results. The sister group relationship between Nephrozoa and Xenacoelomorpha supported by our phylogenomic analyses implies that the last common ancestor of bilaterians was probably a benthic, ciliated acoelomate worm with a single opening into an epithelial gut, and that excretory organs, coelomic cavities, and nerve cords evolved after xenacoelomorphs separated from the stem lineage of Nephrozoa.

This turn has been defined by the increased rate at which liberal international and local peacebuilding practices, and their underlying ideas, have become merged, integrated or co located in time and space. While hybrid approaches to reconciliation have been praised as an effective means of engaging local populations in peacebuilding operations, little attention has been paid to examining whether or not they also bring unintended negative consequences. Drawing on the cases of Timor Leste, Solomon Islands and Bougainville, this article examines the potentially dark side of hybridity. It demonstrates that, in each of these cases, hybrid approaches to political reconciliation have brought both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side of the equation, hybridity has seen imported international approaches to reconciliation adapted to meet local demands and ensure resonance with local populations. On the negative side, however, the misappropriation and instrumentalisation of local practices within hybrid approaches has served to damage their legitimacy and to jeopardise their contributions to reconciliation. The article thus concludes that the existence and extent of this dark side necessitates a re evaluation of how hybrid approaches to political reconciliation are planned and implemented.		38	3.638000011444092

However, the defect detection performance is heavily dependent on manually defined features for defect representation. In this contribution, we investigate a new paradigm from machine learning, namely deep machine learning by examining design configurations of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the impact of different hyper parameter settings towards the accuracy of defect detection results. In contrast to manually designed image processing solutions, deep CNN automatically generate powerful features by hierarchical learning strategies from massive amounts of training data with a minimum of human interaction or expert process knowledge. An application of the proposed method demonstrates excellent defect detection results with low false alarm rates.		239	5.47599983215332

One common way to extract multi scale features is to feed multiple resized input images to a shared deep network and then merge the resulting features for pixelwise classification. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that learns to softly weight the multi scale features at each pixel location. We adapt a state of the art semantic image segmentation model, which we jointly train with multi scale input images and the attention model. The proposed attention model not only outperforms averageand max pooling, but allows us to diagnostically visualize the importance of features at different positions and scales. Moreover, we show that adding extra supervision to the output at each scale is essential to achieving excellent performance when merging multi scale features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, including PASCAL Person Part, PASCAL VOC 2012 and a subset of MS COCO 2014.	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	848	6.743000030517578

In order to help them learn native like pronunciation, we propose to develop targeted classifiers for automatic pronunciation error detection. In this paper, perceptual experiments with modified speech are designed to analyze the exact position of the landmark of a nasal coda. Based on perceptual results from isolated words, we propose that information about nasal coda place of articulation is most dense near a landmark at the center of the nasalized vowel. Landmarks detected in a database of Japanese learners of Mandarin, and classified as correct vs. incorrect using an SVM. The result shows that the detection performance of the SVM+Landmark system is similar to that of a DNN HMM+MFCC system. When the two systems are combined, an FRR of 4.6% is achieved at DA of 83.9% This performance is comparable to that of previously developed classifiers for 16 common Mandarin pronunciation errors.	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	11	2.3980000019073486

We use a Bayesian convolutional neural network to regress the 6 DOF camera pose from a single RGB image. It is trained in an end to end manner with no need of additional engineering or graph optimisation. The algorithm can operate indoors and outdoors in real time, taking under 6ms to compute. It obtains approximately 2m and 6deg accuracy for very large scale outdoor scenes and 0.5m and 10deg accuracy indoors. Using a Bayesian convolutional neural network implementation we obtain an estimate of the model's relocalization uncertainty and improve state of the art localization accuracy on a large scale outdoor dataset. We leverage the uncertainty measure to estimate metric relocalization error and to detect the presence or absence of the scene in the input image. We show that the model's uncertainty is caused by images being dissimilar to the training dataset in either pose or appearance.	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	347	5.848999977111816

Uncontrolled cyberloafing is a threat to organizational effectiveness because it affects organizational productivity. The purpose of this single case study was to explore successful strategies functional managers use to control cyberloafing behaviors of their employees at an e Computer technologies have increased the opportunities for employees to engage in cyberloafing by using the Internet at work for personal purposes. Uncontrolled cyberloafing is a threat to organizational effectiveness because it affects organizational productivity. The purpose of this single case study was to explore successful strategies functional managers use to control cyberloafing behaviors of their employees at an elearning organization located in the northeastern United States. The theory of planned behavior, which emphasized behavioral, normative, and control beliefs as key elements to predict individuals' intentions to behave was the conceptual framework. Data collection included semistructured face to face interviews with 11 functional managers and an exploration of organizational policies, procedures, and handbooks. Data analysis included examination of word frequencies, keyword coding, and theme identification. Using Yin's 5 steps for data analysis, 3 themes emerged: create engaging jobs, communicate clear expectations, and promote a positive work environment. Functional managers in the elearning organization in this study may control cyberloafing by ensuring that social norms convey disapproval, combining deterrence policies and performance metrics; and showing attitudes that promote citizenship behaviors. The implications for positive social change include the potential to provide the e learning organization in this study with best practices that support employees' needs for work life balance, thus promoting employee satisfaction while maximizing employee productivity. As a result, the findings of this study can decrease stress, increase morale and positively impact the overall well being of the organization's workforce.

89	123653614	123653614	Be aware of error measures. Further studies on validation of predictive QSAR models	Abstract Validation is the most crucial concept for development and application of quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models. The validation process confirms the reliability of the developed QSAR models along with the acceptability of each step during model development such as assessing the quality of input data, dataset diversity, predictability on an external set, domain of applicability and mechanistic interpretability. External validation or validation using an independent test set is usually considered as the gold standard in evaluating the quality of predictions from a QSAR model. The external predictivity of QSAR models is commonly described by employing various validation metrics, which can be broadly categorized into two major classes, viz. R2 based metrics namely R2test, Q2(ext_F1) and Q2(ext_F2) and purely error based measures like predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) The problem associated with the error based measures is the absence of any well defined threshold for determining the quality of predictions making the R2 based metrics more suitable for use due to easy comprehension. However, in this paper, we show the problems associated with the R2 based validation metrics commonly used in QSAR studies, since their values are highly dependent on the range of the response values of the test set compounds and their distribution pattern around the training/test set mean. We also propose a guideline for determining the quality of predictions based on MAE and its standard deviation computed from the test set predictions after omitting 5% high residual data points in order to obviate the influence of any rarely occurring high prediction errors that may significantly obscure the quality of predictions for the whole test set. In this manner, we try to evaluate the prediction performance of a model on most (95% of the data points present in the external set. An online tool (XternalValidationPlus) for computing the suggested MAE based criteria (along with other conventional metrics) for external validation has been made available at http:/dtclab.webs.com/software tools and http:/teqip.jdvu.ac.in/QSAR_Tools/ The MAE based criteria suggested here along with other commonly used validation metrics may be applied to evaluate predictive performance of QSAR models with a greater degree of confidence.		377	5.932000160217285

Polluted soil was collected from the vicinity of a textile company in Nigeria. Twelve litre plastic pots were filled with 10 kg soil. Soil amendments applied were: 0 (control) 60 Kg N ha 1 of N.P.K 20:10:10 (recommended rate) 40, 60, 80, and 100 Kg N ha 1 of Composted Market Waste (CMW) The pots were arranged in Completely Randomized Design and replicated three times. Growth parameters were taken. Plants were harvested 8 weeks after sowing and separated into leaves, stems and roots. Lead, Cadmium, Chromium and Zinc levels in plants and soil were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. CMW at 100 Kg N ha 1 significantly (p 0.05) enhanced the growth and yield of kenaf. Highest concentrations of heavy metals were observed in kenaf parts at 100 Kg N ha 1 of CMW. Higher concentrations of Chromium (0.15 mg kg 1 Lead (1.50 mg kg 1 and Cadmium (0.14 mg kg 1 were observed in the root while higher concentration of Zinc (23.48 mg kg 1 was observed in the leaf. (c) JASEM http:/dx.doi.org/10.4314/jasem.v19i4.26 INTRODUCTION In Nigeria, industrial effluent is one of the sources of heavy metals in the environment. Textile industries produce large amount of polluted effluent which contain Chromium, Cadmium Mangamese, Copper and Lead, Poornima et al. 2011) The effluents (both treated and untreated) are discharged into nearby land and water; and the heavy metals enter the human food chain through the fish, milk and meat of the animals fed on plants. Zn, Pb, Cr and Cd cause human disorder for instance lung cancer, chest pain, cough, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, dry throat, headaches (Deepali and Gangwar, 2009) However, there is need to remove these pollutants from soil. Remediation by excavation of polluted soil, putting fertile unpolluted soil on top of the polluted soil and using chelating agent to reduce bioavailability of heavy metals are very expensive (Gleseler, 1987) The use of plants to remove inorganic pollutants from soil (phytoremediation) has being in practice as an alternative to conventional methods. Work has been done on the phytoremediation of Cu (Bada and Umunnakwe, 2011) using kenaf and inorganic fertilizer. Phytoremediation of textile effluent polluted soil using kenaf and composted market waste (organic fertilizer) as soil amendment will go a long way to solve the problem of solid waste management in Nigeria. This research was carried out to assess kenaf performance and its potential to uptake heavy metals in textile effluent polluted soil amended with composted market waste. MATERIALS AND METHODS Representative soil samples in the vicinity of a textile company (6o 34 19 N 3o 29 9 E) Lagos state, Nigeria were collected to a depth of 0 15 cm using soil auger. The soil physical and chemical properties were analysed before sowing kenaf. Composted market waste was applied to 10 kg of the soil at the rate of 0, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg N ha 1 However, three weeks after sowing, recommended 60 kg N ha 1 of N.P.K. 20:10:10 fertilizer (Ogunbodede and Adediran, 1996) was applied by side placement. All treatments were replicated three times. Kenaf were harvested at eight week after sowing by uprooting and separated into leaf, stem and root. Soil properties were also determined using the methods described in Chopra and Kanwar (2011) Bioremediation of textile effluent polluted soil using kenaf 774 *BADA, BS Obtained data were analysed using Analysis of variance while Least Significant Difference was used to separate means. Metal exclusion and metal accumulator were used to estimate kenaf heavy metals tolerance (Yangun et al. 2004) Ogundiran and Osibanjo (2004) stated that is metal accumulator is metal excluder RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The effluent polluted soil was low in N (1.0 g kg 1 P (1.7 mg kg 1 and K (0.1 cmol kg 1 for crop production in Nigeria (FPDD, 1990) The soil also contained elevated concentrations of Pb (5.0 mg kg 1 Cr (5.5 mg kg 1 Zn (27.5 mg kg 1 and Cd (0.5 mg kg 1 compared to Pb: 1.62 mg kg 1 Cr: 3.49 mg kg 1 and Zn: 6.06 mg kg 1 in effluent polluted soil (Poornima et al. 2011) and Cd: 0.018 mg kg 1 in untreated effluent (Deepali and Gangwar 2010) Leaf, stem and root yields of kenaf increase with increase in the level of composted market waste (Table 1) The least significant (p 0.05) yield was observed at 0 (control) Higher leaf, stem and root yields were observed at 100 kg N ha 1 of composted market waste. It is in agreement with previous finding of Bada and Fagbola (2014) that application of composted market waste increase the kenaf performance in the nutrient degraded soil. The higher the level of composted market waste applied, the higher were the concentrations of heavy metals in the stem, leaf and root of kenaf (Table 2) Highest concentration of Pb was observed in the stem. This is not in agreement with the finding of Wozny et al. (1995) who reported that Pb is more accumulated in the roots of greening barley leaves. Highest concentration of Cr was observed in the root of kenaf. In contrary to this, Gafoori et al. (2011) reported highest concentration of chromium in the leaf. Kenaf had potential to accumulate Pb, Cr, Cd and Zn at every level of soil amendments (Table 3) shoot root quotient greater than 1 (Ogundiran and Osibanjo 2008) Kenaf amendment with 100 kg N ha 1 of composted market waste had the highest bioavailability index (Table 4) This might be due to the ability of composted market waste to enhance the growth of kenaf. For plant species to be suitable for phytoremediation, it must produce enough yields and accumulate high content of heavy metal (Chaney et al. 1997) Concentrations of Pb, Cr, Zn and Cd reduced at all levels of composted market waste compared to the initial concentration in the effeluent polluted soil (Table 5) The least values of heavy metals observed at 100 kg N ha 1 of composted market waste might be due to the ability of composted market waste to enhance the growth of kenaf in a nutrient degraded soil (Bada and Fagbola 2014) Conclusion: Effluent polluted soil contained elevated concentrations of Lead, Chromium, Zinc and Cadmium. Application of composted market waste enhanced the growth, yield and heavy metals uptake of kenaf grown in textile effluent polluted soil.

These mobile devices change the way we communicate and enable mobile and ubiquitous learning at a different level. This study evaluated the use of mobile instant messaging tools to support teaching and learning in higher education. A total of 61 undergraduate students enrolled at a teacher training institute in Hong Kong who have smartphones with WhatsApp were assigned into experimental and control groups. Besides the traditional classroom learning for both groups, the experimental group was also supported with bite sized multimedia materials and teacher student interaction via WhatsApp outside school hours. The participants of the control group used WhatsApp only for academic communication. Pre test scores were used as the covariate. The marginal means on the post test scores showed that the participants in the experimental group performed better than those in the control group. The intervention of WhatsApp improved the learning achievement of the participants. The strength of the intervention between the two groups was medium to large. A questionnaire designed by the author was administered at the end of the study. The participants showed positive perception and acceptance of the use of WhatsApp for teaching and learning. The participants slightly rejected the view that receiving instructional materials and questions outside school hours could interfere with their private lives. The typical usability issues on mobile learning were found to be valid. The experience learnt in this research was discussed.	Internet High. Educ.	161	5.080999851226807
93	64391011	64391011	The critical nexus: Linked practices in reading, thinking and writing to develop discourse competency	Informed by a conviction that writing is thinking, this paper presents a model for developing student writing within disciplinary curriculum by linking writing practice explicitly to reading non fiction and critical thinking as co constructive practices of disciplinary discourse. The challenge of developing students' written communication is here focalised through reading and enacted through formative exercises that emphasise writing as a discursive practice and iterative process. This pedagogy aims to reveal to students the conventions and codes of disciplinary discourse through shared reading and writing exercises that focus on reading comprehension. Rather than an empirical study, I offer a practitioner's perspective informed by several years of reflective practice and training in the approaches associated with Writing Across the Curriculum. The goal of describing this pedagogy is to demonstrate how writing practice and development can be integrated with existing curriculum without displacing subject content. The example here is drawn from a First Year subject in Screen Media Studies located within a School of Humanities Creative Arts.		6	1.7920000553131104

The objective of this article is to explain the process of the development of and to assess the Mexican food based dietary and physical activity guidelines (FBDGs) The FBDGs were developed by an intersectoral and interdisciplinary committee of 11 national experts with input from 11 external advisors. The sectors represented were research and academic institutions, the Ministry of Health, and a nongovernmental organization. The evidence based process included the following: literature reviews of local, national, and international evidence; review of dietary patterns of the Mexican population; key national and international recommendations; and review of FBDGs and visual icons from other countries. The guidelines' report follows the life course socioecological model rooted in a deep understanding of the epidemiology and underlying causes of malnutrition in Mexico. The guidelines are summarized in 10 pretested main recommendations that include, and go beyond, simply promoting the consumption of a healthy and varied diet that includes fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains and staying within caloric needs and staying active. The guidelines strongly emphasize healthy cooking habits, enjoyable meals with family and friends, drinking water, and avoiding the consumption of sweetened beverages, grain based desserts, and highly processed foods. Detailed guidelines specific to different groups (on the basis of age and physiologic status) are also included. An innovative aspect of the Mexican FBDGs is the inclusion of dietary guidance of children <2 y of age. Future editions of these guidelines should consider removing their emphasis on dietary cholesterol and total dietary fat and placing more attention on the substitution of saturated and trans fats with healthy oils. The process of national agenda setting, policy articulation, and implementation of the Mexican FBDGs in the context of addressing the national obesity epidemic deserves to be initiated and formally assessed through the lens of evidence based, public nutrition complex adaptive systems.

It plays an integral role during threat detection and situation assessment in the monitored area. This paper considers a ground ISR system comprising distributed Unmanned Ground Sensors (UGS) which perform military vehicle identification based on acoustic signal analysis. Each UGS operates autonomously and transmits its identification estimates through a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to data aggregation and fusion nodes, where situation assessment is performed. The vehicles are identified by applying a multistage decision making approach comprising time and frequency domain feature analysis and classification procedures. System operation is validated in a field experiment, during which several moving military vehicles are identified by UGS prototypes implemented on the BeagleBone Black platform. Identification accuracy reaches 89% for the chosen vehicles.	2016 15th Biennial Baltic Electronics Conference (BEC)	5	1.6089999675750732

Although Multi view maximum entropy discrimination considered the multi view information of the data, it just respects the consensus principle. There are two common principles named consensus and complementarity in multi view learning. We aim to take the full advantage of the multi view information of the data for classification, and respect the two common principles consensus and complementarity simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new method called consensus and complementarity based MED (MED 2C) for multi view classification, which well utilizes the two principles consensus and complementarity for multi view learning (MVL) We first transform data from two views into a common subspace and make the transformed data in the new subspace identical to respect the consensus principle. Then we augment the transformed data with their original features to take into account the complementarity principle. Built on the augmented features and meanwhile by relaxing the consensus principle, the objective function of MED 2C is naturally formed whose inner optimization recovers the traditional MED framework. We provide an instantiation of the MED 2C method and derive the corresponding solution. Experimental results on synthetic data and real world data show the effectiveness of the proposed MED 2C. It not only performs better than three single view classification methods but also generally outperforms three multi view classification methods canonical correlation analysis (CCA) ensemble MED (EMED) and the multi view variant SVM 2K of the classical support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In addition, MED 2C performs better than or as well as state of the art MVMED on all the data sets.	Inf. Sci.	55	4.006999969482422

Accurate segmentation of glands from histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics for quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep contour aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified multi task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi level contextual features from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary supervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi task regularization during the training, the discriminative capability of intermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied to large scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to generate contours based on low level cues for post separating. Our method won the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge out of 13 competitive teams, surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin.	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	358	5.88100004196167

Tissues like bone, skin, amniotic membrane and soft tissues obtained from human donor can be used for repair or reconstruction of the injured part of the body. Allograft tissues from human donor provide an excellent alternative to autografts. However, major concern with the use of allografts is the risk of infectious disease transmission. Therefore, tissue allografts should be sterilized to make them safe for clinical use. Gamma radiation has several advantages and is the most suitable method for sterilization of biological tissues. This review summarizes the use of gamma irradiation technology as an effective method for sterilization of biological tissues and ensuring safety of tissue allografts.

The ability to access, store/retrieve and share information anytime, anywhere on the cloud has contributed to the birth of the cloud based virtual learning environment (c VLE) Though there are studies conducted on the grid based VLEs, however due to the significant differences between the two computing technologies; the findings from prior studies may not be germane in the c VLE context. Unlike the previous studies which studied TAM, UTAUT and their extensions from the perspective of undergraduates and university instructors, this study examined the role of Channel Expansion Theory (CET) VLE related attributes (i.e. interactivity, content design, trust in website) school support and knowledge sharing attitude from the perspective of school teachers. Educational level and teaching experience were introduced as the control variables. Data were gathered in two waves of nation wide surveys with random sampling. The findings revealed significant effects of CET, all VLE related attributes (except content design) school support and attitude towards knowledge sharing on behavioural intention (BI) BI was found to have direct effect on instructional effectiveness (IE) The model explained 68.9% 62.5% and 28.9% variances in CET, BI and IE.

Broad utilization of drip irrigation technologies in Israel has contributed to the 1600 percent increase in the value of produce grown by local farmers over the past sixty five years. The recycling of 86% of Israeli sewage now provides 50% of the country's irrigation water and is the second, idiosyncratic component in Israel's strategy to overcome water scarcity and maintain agriculture in a dryland region. The sustainability of these two practices is evaluated in light of decades of experience and ongoing research by the local scientific community. The review confirms the dramatic advantages of drip irrigation over time, relative to flood, furrow and sprinkler irrigation and its significance as a central component in agricultural production, especially under arid conditions. In contrast, empirical findings increasingly report damage to soil and to crops from salinization caused by irrigation with effluents. To be environmentally and agriculturally sustainable over time, wastewater reuse programs must ensure extremely high quality treated effluents and ultimately seek the desalinization of recycled sewage.

This study was conducted in order to define the effects of oregofarm (peppermint, thyme and anise oil) supplementation in the drinking water on the growth performance, carcass quality and histologic structure of terminal ileum in quails. A total of 348 Japanese quail chicks (Coturnix coturnix japonica) of both sexes were included in this study. They were divided into one control group and two experimental groups and each of them contained 116 Japanese quail chicks. Each group was further divided into four subgroups with 29 Japanese quail chicks. This study was finalized in six weeks. All groups were fed with basal diets and received fresh water during the experiment. The control group received non supplemented water. The group 1 and 2 received 1.0 ml/5 L and 1.5 ml/5 L oil mixture, respectively. All experimental groups were fed with water and ad libitum. As a result of the study, there were statistically significant differences between the feed consumption and efficiency (P<0.001) in the end of the three weeks. Similarly, there were also statistically significant differences between same parameters (P<0.01; 0.05) five weeks later. The body weights of quails were not significantly different from each other (P>0.05) At the end of the study, there were statistically differences in the warm and cold carcass parameters (P<0.05) Adding essential oil mixed were not affected on histological structure of terminal ileum (P>0.05) Conclusively, the supplementation of oregofarm (peppermint thyme and anise oil) has no additional effect on quail performance.		4	1.3860000371932983

Since 1908, when Mie reported analytical expressions for the fields scattered by a spherical particle upon incidence of plane waves, generalizing his analysis for the case of an arbitrary incident wave has been an open question because of the cancellation of the prefactor radial spherical Bessel function. This cancellation was obtained before by our own group for a highly focused beam centered in the objective. In this work, however, we show for the first time how these terms can be canceled out for any arbitrary incident field that satisfies Maxwells equations, and obtain analytical expressions for the beam shape coefficients. We show several examples on how to use our method to obtain analytical beam shape coefficients for: Bessel beams, general hollow waveguide modes and specific geometries such as cylindrical and rectangular. Our method uses the vector potential, which shows the interesting characteristic of being gauge invariant. These results are highly relevant for speeding up numerical calculation of light scattering applications such as the radiation forces acting on spherical particles placed in an arbitrary electromagnetic field, as in an optical tweezers system.

One major piece of evidence for this proposition has been the fact that Quantum Annealing (QA) finds the minimum of some cost functions exponentially more quickly than classical Simulated Annealing (SA) One such cost function is the simple ""Hamming weight with a spike"" function in which the input is an n bit string and the objective function is simply the Hamming weight, plus a tall thin barrier centered around Hamming weight n/4. While the global minimum of this cost function can be found by inspection, it is also a plausible toy model of the sort of local minima that arise in realworld optimization problems. It was shown by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann [1] that for this example SA takes exponential time and QA takes polynomial time, and the same result was generalized by Reichardt [2] to include barriers with width nz and height na for z a 1/2. This advantage could be explained in terms of quantummechanical ""tunneling."" Our work considers a classical algorithm known as Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) which relates certain quantum systems to classical Markov chains. By proving that these chains mix rapidly, we show that SQA runs in polynomial time on the Hamming weight with spike problem in much of the parameter regime where QA achieves an exponential advantage over SA. While our analysis only covers this toy model, it can be seen as evidence against the prospect of exponential quantum speedup using tunneling. Our technical contributions include extending the canonical path method for analyzing Markov chains to cover the case when not all vertices can be connected by low congestion paths. We also develop methods for taking advantage of warm starts and for relating the quantum state in QA to the probability distribution in SQA. These techniques may be of use in future studies of SQA or of rapidly mixing Markov chains in general."	2016 IEEE 57th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)	63	4.14300012588501

Many countries, including the UK, Australia, and the USA, and international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD) have developed performance tools with the goals to enhance effectiveness, equity, efficiency, and quality as well as to meet the public's demand for increased transparency and accountability from their public institutions (Aboriginal Health Medical Research Council of New South Wales, 2013; Arah, Klazinga, Delnoij, Ten Asbroek, Custers, 2003; McLoughlin, Leatherman, Fletcher, Owen, 2001; McPake Mills, 2000; Pal, 2000) As Paul Thomas (2006) aptly expressed, performance measurements achieved popularity in large part to address serious ""democratic deficits,"" (p. 6) a decline in legitimacy and public confidence in political institutions along with other financial, social, and performance deficits.This article examines the extent to which public servants interact with non governmental organizations (NGOs) to co construct performance indicators in the home and community care sector. Based on 32 extensive qualitative interviews with NGO representatives and public servants in three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario) with distinctive home and community care systems, the study uncovers the experiences of NGO government interactions. Specifically, it seeks to understand the role of NGOs in determining performance indicators by asking why performance indicators matter, what hand NGOs have in shaping them, under what contexts, and to what effect? Determining the appropriate indicators for the home and community care sector can play an important role in influencing the future direction of provincial healthcare systems, especially as the Canadian population ages. Varying funding and delivery models of home and community care across provinces put NGOs in different roles in the delivery of home and community supports, setting different contexts for NGO public servant interactions across the three provinces. This article takes these different contexts into account in assessing how, and to what extent, NGOs influence the nature of performance indicators.The literature offers a number of common definitions of performance indicators. According to Jan Mainz (2003) indicators are:measures that assess a particular health care process or outcome; quantitative measures that can be used to monitor and evaluate the quality of important governance, management, clinical, and support functions that affect patient outcomes, and measurement tools, screens or flags that are used as guides to monitor, evaluate, and improve the quality of patient care, clinical support services, and organisational function that affect patient outcomes. (p. 524)Les Pal (2014) offers a more succinct definition: performance indicators refer generally to ""some measure of how well a service or activity is doing, either through financial or output measures or client satisfaction"" (p. 174).Researchers have long posed questions around the validity, reliability, impact, and scope of performance indicators in health. For example, there are ongoing debates regarding what can be measured, depending on how narrowly or broadly we define healthcare and our responsibility for it: how performance is conceptualized and measured (Arah et al. 2003) whether the emphasis is on ""process"" or ""outcomes"" (Mant, 2001; Steele Gray, Berta, Deber, Lum, 2014a, 2014b) whether ""quality"" takes on a multidimensional nature, hence, requiring multiple measurement dimensions (Aboriginal Health Medical Research Council of New South Wales, 2013) whether client preferences are part of the cost equation (Donabedian, 1988) how performance data are used; which stakeholder viewpoints should hold sway since different stakeholder have different views as to what processes or outcomes should be measured and how (Arah et al."		1	0.0
111	16791707	16791707	The mixed Lipschitz space and its dual for tree metrics	Abstract This paper develops a theory of harmonic analysis on spaces with tree metrics, extending previous work in this direction by Gavish, Nadler and Coifman (2010) [30] and Gavish and Coifman (2011, 2012) [28] [29] We show how a natural system of martingales and martingale differences induced by a partition tree leads to simple and effective characterizations of the Lipschitz norm and its dual for functions on a single tree metric space. The restrictions we place on the tree metrics are far more general than those considered in previous work. As the dual norm is equal to the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between two probability distributions, we recover a simple formula for EMD with respect to tree distances presented by Charikar (2002) [36] We also consider the situation where an arbitrary metric is approximated by the average of a family of dominating tree metrics. We show that the Lipschitz norm and its dual for the tree metrics can be combined to yield an approximation to the corresponding norms for the underlying metric. The main contributions of this paper, however, are the generalizations of the aforementioned results to the setting of the product of two or more tree metric spaces. For functions on a product space, the notion of regularity we consider is not the Lipschitz condition, but rather the mixed Lipschitz condition that controls the size of a function's mixed difference quotient. This condition is extremely natural for datasets that can be described as a product of metric spaces, such as word document databases. We develop effective formulas for norms equivalent to the mixed Lipschitz norm and its dual, and extend our results on combining pairs of trees.		4	1.3860000371932983
112	111376629	111376629	On Using Pareto Optimality to Tune a Linear Model Predictive Controller for Wind Turbines	Optimal operation of wind turbines is important in order to minimize cost of energy, which is one of the major focus areas of the wind industry. Model predictive control (MPC) is a candidate for a control solution which effectively balances the different and potentially conflicting objectives, e.g. generated power and structural loads. This article presents a method on how to tune multi objective MPC problems using Pareto curves. The approach is applied to a realistic wind turbine MPC problem, in which a joint power and tower fore aft fatigue load optimization is performed. The controller is evaluated on a high fidelity model using a Vestas wind turbine simulator. In addition to the multiple control objectives, a number of constraints are considered as well. The evaluation shows a good potential of using model predictive control for this problem compared with an industrial baseline controller as, it approximately obtains the same mean generated power, while lowering the tower fore aft fatigue loads. The computed Pareto curves of the trade off between tower fore aft fatigue load and mean generated power for a number of different weight matrices, demonstrate a potential tool for tuning MPC solutions for a wind turbine.		43	3.760999917984009
113	7218494	7218494	A Computing Perspective on Smart City	DEVELOPING smart city is the key to the next generation urbanization process for improving the efficiency, reliability, and security of a traditional city. The concept of smart city includes various aspects such as environmental sustainability, social sustainability, regional competitiveness, natural resources management, cybersecurity, and quality of life improvement. With the massive deployment of networked smart devices/sensors, an unprecedentedly large amount of sensory data can be collected and processed by advanced computing paradigms, which are the enabling techniques for smart city. For example, given historical environmental, population, and economic information, salient modeling and analytics are needed to simulate the impact of potential city planning strategies, which will be critical for intelligent decision making. Analytics are also indispensable for discovering the underlying structure from retrieved data in order to design the optimal policies for real time automatic control in the cyberphysical smart city system. Furthermore, uncertainties and security concerns in the data collected from heterogeneous resources aggravate the problem, which makes smart city planning, operation, monitoring, and control highly challenging. Green, sustainable, and secure computing in smart cities has recently become a very active area of research in academia and has attracted significant industry interest. Since the computing issues for smart cities are highly interdisciplinary and cover various topics, a special section of Smart City Computing in the IEEE Transactions on Computers becomes an ideal forum for presenting and discussing the latest research results. The goal of this special section is to present the outstanding research results dedicated to the topics of green, sustainable, and secure computing for smart cities. We have received 40 manuscript submissions in total and six papers have finally been accepted after several rounds of very constructive and deep reviews. The smart city brings convenience to users through providing personalized yet efficient services. However, it also introduces privacy and security issues. Two different methods are used to counteract these issues. The active method is to prevent the overcollection of private data (Dai et al. while the passive method is to make private data more secure via certain encryption algorithms (Zhang et al. Dai et al. study the current state of data overcollection and look at some of the most frequent cases of overcollected data. They present a mobile cloud framework, which is an active approach to eradicate data overcollection. Through putting all users' data into a cloud, the security of the data can be greatly improved. Zhang et al. use the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and employ cloud servers to perform the high order back propagation algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model training. Furthermore, their proposed scheme approximates the sigmoid function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of the activation function with the BGV encryption. Data infrastructures play an important role in smart city computing. Two interesting topics are included in this special section, which are wireless sensor network for data collection (Santos et al. and spatial temporal database for data storage (Ding et al. respectively. Santos et al. propose a decentralized algorithm for detecting damage in structures using a WSAN. As key characteristics, beyond presenting a fully decentralized (in network) and collaborative approach for detecting damage in structures, the algorithm makes use of cooperative information fusion for calculating a damage coefficient, which represents frequency and amplitude shifts simultaneously. Ding et al. propose the Parallel Distributed Network constrained Moving Objects Database (PD NMOD) a general framework that manages big trajectory data in a scalable manner. The PD NMOD provides an infrastructure that is able to support a wide variety of smart transportation applications, thus benefiting the smart city vision as a whole. Furthermore, two interesting applications are selected to instantiate the effect of smart city computing, which includes smart grid (Wei et al. and smart railway transportation (Huang et al. Concerning the application domain of the smart grid, Huang et al. propose a comprehensive framework to integrate the operations of smart buildings into the energy scheduling of bulk power systems through proactive building demand participation. This new scheme enables buildings to proactively express and communicate their energy consumption preferences to smart grid operators rather than passively receive and react to market signals and instructions such as time varying electricity prices. For smart railway transportation, Huang et al. propose an energy efficient train control framework through integrating both offline and onboard optimization techniques. The offline processing builds a decision tree based sketchy solution through a complete flow of sequence mining, optimization, and machine learning. The onboard system feeds the train parameters into the decision tree to derive an optimized control sequence. For this special section of the IEEE Transactions on Computers we have selected the above very interesting papers to represent some important advances in smart city computing.

114	151901185	151901185	Making the connection between child abuse and cancer: Definitional, methodological, and theoretical issues	Research has begun to explore the relationship between cancer and child abuse. Thus far, work has shown that child abuse is associated with higher odds of cancer in adulthood. Unfortunately, the current research is plagued by three interrelated issues: (1) there is no agreement as to what actions constitute abuse and how abuse types (i.e. physical, sexual, and emotional abuse) are distinct or interrelated; (2) analytic strategies limit the types of conclusions that can be drawn because of how they treat or measure abuse and related concepts; and (3) few theories exist to explain the connection between abuse and cancer. Each of these issues and their implications is described. Then an integrated theoretical framework that attempts to address current shortcomings is proposed. Going forward, abuse research should carefully consider the measures and mechanisms linking abuse to disease in order to test meaningful hypotheses and advance our theoretical understanding of these connections.		6	1.7920000553131104

Each deaminase is identified by the DNA or RNA nucleotide sequence ""motif"" surrounding the nucleotide targeted for deamination. The primary objective of this study is to develop an in silico approach to identify nucleotide sequence changes of the target motifs of key deaminases during oncogenesis. If successful, a secondary objective is to investigate if such changes are associated with disease progression indicators that include disease stage and progression free survival time. Using a discovery cohort of 194 high grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma (HGS OvCa) exomes, the results confirm the ability of the novel in silico approach used to identify changes in the preferred target motifs for AID, APOBEC3G, APOBEC3B, and ADAR1 during oncogenesis. Using this approach, a set of new cancer progression associated signatures (C PASs) were identified. Furthermore, it was found that the C PAS identified can be used to differentiate between the cohort of patients that remained progression free for longer than 60 months, from those in which disease progressed within 60 months (sensitivity 95% specificity 90% The spectrum of outcomes observed here could provide a foundation for future clinical assessment of susceptibility variants in ovarian, and several other cancers as disease progresses. The ability of the in silico methodology used to identify changes in deaminase motifs during oncogenesis also suggests new links between immune system function and tumorigenesis."

117	614094	614094	NUR77 exerts a protective effect against inflammatory bowel disease by negatively regulating the TRAF6/TLR IL 1R signalling axis	Nur77, an immediate early response gene, participates in a wide range of biological functions. Its human homologue, NUR77, is known by several names and has the HGNC approved gene symbol NR4A1. However, the role of Nur77 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using public data from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC) on the most recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) we found that genetic variants of the NUR77 gene are associated with increased risk for both UC and CD. Accordingly, Nur77 expression was significantly reduced in colon tissues from patients with UC or CD and mice treated with DSS. Nur77 deficiency increased the susceptibility of mice to DSS induced experimental colitis and prevented intestinal recovery, whereas treatment with cytosporone B (Csn B) an agonist for Nur77, significantly attenuated excessive inflammatory response in the DSS induced colitis mouse model. Mechanistically, NUR77 acts as a negative regulator of TLR IL 1R signalling by interacting with TRAF6. This interaction prevented auto ubiquitination and oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequently inhibited NF kB activation and pro inflammatory cytokine production. Taken together, our GWAS based analysis and in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that Nur77 is an important regulator of TRAF6/TLR IL 1R initiated inflammatory signalling, and loss of Nur77 may contribute to the development of IBD, suggesting Nur77 as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of IBD.

Patents and trademarks are examples of approaches to protecting inventions. Sub Saharan African countries operate under both international, regional, and domestic IPR regimes. For example, the International Treaty on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture ""Plant Treaty"" approved in 2001 announced an important principle under the Plant Treaty, the Farmers' Rights under which farmers are recognized as the guardians and holders of traditional knowledge and stewards of agricultural biodiversity. The Plant Treaty allows farmers to share benefits arising from the utilization of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. There are only a few court cases involving IPR violation. Most of the cases deal with the situation where an importer attempts to register a product in the domestic market as their own trademark."		2	0.6930000185966492

In the proposed DT concept, feeder reconfiguration (FR) is employed through mixed integer programming when calculating the DT, leading to minimized energy cost and reduced DT as compared with the DT concept without FR. This paper further demonstrates that the line losses can be taken into account during the calculation of DT. As a result, the line loss reduction can be realized in a decentralized manner through the DT framework. Three case studies were conducted to validate the optimal reconfiguration based DT method for congestion management and line loss reduction in distribution networks.

We document persistent commonality in risk attitudes inside firms, which arises through the selection of leaders with similar preferences and is rooted in the founders' risk attitudes. Changes in corporate risk culture over time affect corporate investment policies, while cross sectional differences in founders' risk attitudes, i.e. firms' initial risk culture, contribute to differences across firms in persistent firm policies, such as R&D intensity.		80	4.381999969482422

The Theory of Connectivity proposes that the origin of intelligence is rooted in a power of two based permutation logic (N 2i 1) producing specific to general cell assembly architecture capable of generating specific perceptions and memories, as well as generalized knowledge and flexible actions. We show that this power of two based permutation logic is widely used in cortical and subcortical circuits across animal species and is conserved for the processing of a variety of cognitive modalities including appetitive, emotional and social information. However, modulatory neurons, such as dopaminergic (DA) neurons, use a simpler logic despite their distinct subtypes. Interestingly, this specific to general permutation logic remained largely intact although NMDA receptors the synaptic switch for learning and memory were deleted throughout adulthood, suggesting that the logic is developmentally pre configured. Moreover, this computational logic is implemented in the cortex via combining a random connectivity strategy in superficial layers 2/3 with nonrandom organizations in deep layers 5/6. This randomness of layers 2/3 cliques which preferentially encode specific and low combinatorial features and project inter cortically is ideal for maximizing cross modality novel pattern extraction, pattern discrimination and pattern categorization using sparse code, consequently explaining why it requires hippocampal offline consolidation. In contrast, the nonrandomness in layers 5/6 which consists of few specific cliques but a higher portion of more general cliques projecting mostly to subcortical systems is ideal for feedback control of motivation, emotion, consciousness and behaviors. These observations suggest that the brain's basic computational algorithm is indeed organized by the power of two based permutation logic. This simple mathematical logic can account for brain computation across the entire evolutionary spectrum, ranging from the simplest neural networks to the most complex.	Front. Syst.

123	10323708	10323708	Theoretical explanations for maintenance of behaviour change: a systematic review of behaviour theories	ABSTRACT Background: Behaviour change interventions are effective in supporting individuals in achieving temporary behaviour change. Behaviour change maintenance, however, is rarely attained. The aim of this review was to identify and synthesise current theoretical explanations for behaviour change maintenance to inform future research and practice. Methods: Potentially relevant theories were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO) In addition, an existing database of 80 theories was searched, and 25 theory experts were consulted. Theories were included if they formulated hypotheses about behaviour change maintenance. Included theories were synthesised thematically to ascertain overarching explanations for behaviour change maintenance. Initial theoretical themes were cross validated. Findings: One hundred and seventeen behaviour theories were identified, of which 100 met the inclusion criteria. Five overarching, interconnected themes representing theoretical explanations for behaviour change maintenance emerged. Theoretical explanations of behaviour change maintenance focus on the differential nature and role of motives, self regulation, resources (psychological and physical) habits, and environmental and social influences from initiation to maintenance. Discussion: There are distinct patterns of theoretical explanations for behaviour change and for behaviour change maintenance. The findings from this review can guide the development and evaluation of interventions promoting maintenance of health behaviours and help in the development of an integrated theory of behaviour change maintenance.

Une evaluation des proprietes thermiques du bassin sedimentaire des Basses Terres du Saint Laurent (BTSL) a ete realisee. Les proprietes thermiques ciblees sont la conductivite et la capacite thermique massique. Des methodes directes et d'autres indirectes ont ete utilisees pour estimer ces proprietes. L'objectif principal de ce travail consiste a apporter une evaluation fiable de ces proprietes thermiques necessaires pour une prospection efficace des ressources geothermiques du bassin. Ce travail s'inscrit dans un vaste projet qui etudie la possibilite d'installer une centrale electrique geothermique au Quebec. Dans une premiere etape, les caracteristiques thermiques de ce bassin ont ete evaluees sur des echantillons de surface. Quarante sept echantillons issus des differentes formations geologiques ont ete analyses. Des mesures directes de la conductivite thermique ont ete realisees en laboratoire a l'aide d'une sonde a aiguille. La capacite thermique massique a ete evaluee en utilisant la composition mineralogique determinee sur des observations microscopiques. On a calcule ensuite les proprietes thermiques moyennes pour chaque unite du bassin. Dans une seconde etape, des profils de conductivite thermique ont ete determines a partir des donnees diagraphiques disponibles pour le bassin des BTSL. L'objectif de cette methode indirecte est de reduire l'incertitude liee a l'heterogeneite de ce parametre. Deux approches, une basee sur des inversions et l'autre sur des regressions multilineaires, ont ete appliquees et des corrections de pression ainsi que de temperature ont ete apportees aux profils de conductivite thermique. La resolution de l'equation de chaleur (Poisson) par difference finie a finalement permis d'evaluer la densite du flux de chaleur terrestre et de determiner un profil de temperature pour chaque puits. Les resultats demontrent que les formations argileuses des groupes d'Utica et de Sainte Rosalie sont les plus isolantes, avec une conductivite thermique de l'ordre de 2.5 W/(m.K) et une capacite thermique massique de pres de 850 J/(kg. K) En revanche, les formations greseuses se presentent comme les unites les plus conductrices de chaleur. Les gres du Groupe de Potsdam, par exemple, montrent une conductivite thermique allant jusqu'a 6 W/(m.K) et une chaleur massique de 730 J/(kg. K) La carte du flux de chaleur preparee montre des estimations allant de 40 mW/m2 a 140 mW/m2. Les temperatures moyennes calculees sont de l'ordre de de 32deg C a 1000 m, 63deg C a 2500 m, 95deg C a 4000 m et 119deg C a 5000 m de profondeur. Certaines valeurs elevees sont situees pres de la ligne Logan qui delimite les provinces geologiques des Basses Terres du Saint Laurent des Appalaches.		3	1.0989999771118164

Os pais responderam a uma entrevista e as suas respostas foram examinadas atraves de analise de conteudo qualitativa, com base em tres dimensoes do envolvimento paterno: interacao, disponibilidade e responsabilidade. Os pais relataram se envolver com o filho de acordo com as necessidades e habilidades especificas dos 12 meses, idade em que o bebe passa a ser mais responsivo. Contudo, alguns pais relataram nao ter a habilidade necessaria para cuidar de um bebe, o que pode contribuir para um menor envolvimento com o filho. Os resultados do estudo evidenciam que os pais mostraram se competentes para lidar com um bebe com novas habilidades, mesmo que, em alguns momentos, eles parecessem sentir dificuldades ou ainda preferissem que a mae realizasse determinadas atividades.		3	1.0989999771118164
126	8527332	8527332	Link Prediction via Matrix Completion	Inspired by practical importance of social networks, economic networks, biological networks and so on, studies on large and complex networks have attracted a surge of attentions in the recent years. Link prediction is a fundamental issue to understand the mechanisms by which new links are added to the networks. We introduce the method of robust principal component analysis (robust PCA) into link prediction, and estimate the missing entries of the adjacency matrix. On one hand, our algorithm is based on the sparsity and low rank property of the matrix, on the other hand, it also performs very well when the network is dense. This is because a relatively dense real network is also sparse in comparison to the complete graph. According to extensive experiments on real networks from disparate fields, when the target network is connected and sufficiently dense, whatever it is weighted or unweighted, our method is demonstrated to be very effective and with prediction accuracy being considerably improved comparing with many state of the art algorithms.

We conducted a further mechanistic investigation into the association of Nur77 with cell death. Cytosporone B (Csn B) an agonist for Nur77, and Nur77 knockdown were adopted in the 6 hydroxydopamine (OHDA) lesioned PC12 cells to investigate the mechanisms underlying Nur77 mediated injury. The 6 OHDA incubation caused Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to cytosol and Endoplasm reticulum (ER) and induced co localization of Tom20/Nur77 and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI)/Nur77. Nur77 activation further decreased cell viability, aggravated intracellular LDH release, intracellular Ca2+ ROS levels, apoptosis, ER tress and, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DPsm) decline. In addition, Nur77 activation significantly enhanced the efficiency of autophagy as indicated by an up regulation of Beclin 1/LC 3 and downregulation of p62, and aggravated mitochondrial dysfunctions and ER stress as shown by increased HSP60/Cytochrome C (Cyt C) and CHOP ATF3 levels respectively. These changes could be partially reversed by Nur77 knockdown. Moreover, Nur77 activation upregulated PINK1 and downregulated Parkin levels. We conclude that Nur77 exacerbates PC12 cell death at least partially by aggravating the mitochondrial impairment and ER stress and enhancing autophagy. We propose that Nur77 is likely a critical target in the PD therapy.	Scientific reports	21	3.0450000762939453

This paper studies semi supervised dimensionality reduction using pairwise constraints. In this setting, domain knowledge is given in the form of pairwise constraints, which specifies whether a pair of instances belong to the same class (must link constraint) or different classes (cannot link constraint) In this paper, a novel semi supervised dimensionality reduction method called Adaptive Semi Supervised Dimensionality Reduction with Sparse Representation (ASSDR SR) is proposed, which can get the optimized low dimensional representation of the original data by adaptively adjusting the weights of the pairwise constraints and simultaneously optimizing the graph construction using the ?1 graph of sparse representation. Experiments on clustering and classification tasks show that ASSDR SR is superior to some existing dimensionality reduction methods.	Neurocomputing	5	1.6089999675750732

Since the 2008 crisis, there has been increasing interest in using ideas from complexity theory to make sense of economic and financial markets. Concepts, such as tipping points, networks, contagion, feedback, and resilience have entered the financial and regulatory lexicon, but actual use of complexity models and results remains at an early stage. Recent insights and techniques offer potential for better monitoring and management of highly interconnected economic and financial systems and, thus, may help anticipate and manage future crises.

The dissolution of arsenic bearing iron(III) (oxyhydr)oxides during combined microbial iron(III) and arsenate(V) reduction is thought to be the main mechanism responsible for arsenic mobilization in reducing environments. Besides its mobilization during bioreduction, arsenic is often resequestered by newly forming secondary iron(II) bearing mineral phases. In phosphate bearing environments, iron(II) inputs generally lead to vivianite precipitation. In fact, in a previous study we observed that during bioreduction of arsenate(V) bearing biogenic iron(III) (oxyhydr)oxides in phosphate containing growth media, arsenate(V) was immobilized by the newly forming secondary iron(II) and iron(II)/iron(III)mineral phases, including vivianite. In the present study, changes in arsenic redox state and binding environment in these experiments were analyzed. We found that arsenate(V) partly replaced phosphate in vivianite, thus forming a vivianite symplesite solid solution identified as Fe3(PO4)1.7(AsO4)0.3*8H2O. Our data suggests that in order to predict the fate of arsenic during the bioreduction of abiogenic and biogenic iron(III) (oxyhydr)oxides in arsenic contaminated environments, the formation of symplesite vivianite minerals needs to be considered. Indeed, such mineral phases could contribute to a delayed and slow release of arsenic in phosphate bearing surface and groundwater environments.	Environmental science technology	55	4.006999969482422

Turned off electric appliance generally still require standby power when they are plugged in. In this paper we proposed a way to reduce standby power of electric home appliance and ZigBee based smart meter for smart grid application. The proposed socket supplies the appliances with power when the user turns them on. Our socket shuts the electric power off and reduces the standby power to zero when the user turns them off. The proposed design uses a microcontroller unit (MCU) receives signals from a Core Balanced Current Transformer (CBCT) and from a Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) sensor which detects the user approaching the socket and provides MCU to control the relay On/Off when used as an appliance switch for shutting off the standby power. The components used in the proposed design are low cost and consume only 0.5 W. The MCU monitoring program provides both automatic detection of the user by the PIR sensor and detection of power consumption. The MCU measure the instantaneous current values and send it to data center computer through ZigBee module which acts as a smart meter for smart grid application.		19	2.944000005722046

This study was to explore the chemical diversity of HM, BM and FM by metabolomic approaches. GC TOFMS and UPLC QTOFMS were applied to investigate the metabolic compositions in 30 HM samples, 20 FM samples and 20 BM samples. Metabolite profiling identified that most of the non esterified fatty acids, which reflected the hydrolysis of triglycerides, were much more abundant in HM than those in FM and BM, except for palmitic acid and stearic acid. The levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates were much higher in FM and BM than those in HM. Each type of milk also showed its unique composition of free amino acids and free carbohydrates. In conclusion, higher levels of non esterified saturated fatty acids with aliphatic tails <16 carbons, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower levels of TCA intermediates are characteristic of HM, as compared with FM and BM. The content of non esterified fatty acids may reflect the hydrolysis of triglycerides in different milk types.	International journal of molecular sciences	32	3.4660000801086426

Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group; Dxp (500 mg/kg) group; LPS group; LPS Dxp (500 mg/kg) group. The effects of dexpanthenol on LPS induced neutrophil recruitment, cytokine levels, total protein concentration, myeloperoxidase (MPO) malondialdehyde (MDA) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) contents were examined. Additionally, lung tissue was examined by histology to investigate the changes in pathology in the presence and absence of dexpanthenol. In LPS challenged mice, dexpanthenol significantly improved lung edema. Dexpanthenol also markedly inhibited the LPS induced neutrophiles influx, protein leakage, and release of TNF a and IL 6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) Furthermore, dexpanthenol attenuated MPO activity and MDA contents and increased SOD and GSH activity in the LPS challenged lung tissue. These data suggest that dexpanthenol protects mice from LPS induced acute lung injury by its anti inflammatory and anti oxidative activities.	Inflammation	23	3.134999990463257

The present contribution explores this notion by discussing the liberalization of trade in low carbon goods as a contribution to the fight against climate change. It provides an overview over the existing trade barriers and the efforts to eliminate these barriers for renewable energy goods and energy efficient technologies. The contribution furthermore identifies the liberalization potentials and main challenges in the multilateral, plurilateral and regional contexts. Perhaps surprisingly, mega regional trade agreements are identified as the most promising venue to pursue ambitious liberalization efforts for low carbon goods, if trade negotiators were willing to make this a central part of the agreements.		6	1.7920000553131104

At the same time, its theories and practices are not only an important supplement and development for linguistics, but also very important for theories and practices of foreign language teaching. The foreign language teaching must pay attention to the cultivation of students' communicative ability. However, foreign language teaching in China has ignored the communicative ability with only paying attention to the language form for a long time. The paper is intended to analyze the reasons why sociolinguistics encounters so many obstacles in English teaching in China and the existing problems of China's foreign language teaching to help the readers have a better understanding of the application of sociolinguistics in China's English teaching.		1	0.0

In few cases it may lead to catastrophic syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies are circulating antibodies which bind with the plasma proteins which in turn bind to phospholipids and thus lead to pathogenesis. Despite of so many researches done in the field of APLA, the mechanisms leading to obstetric complications are still debatable. Antiphospholipid antibodies are detected on the basis of solid phase assays which comprised of anticardiolipin (acl) antibody and Anti b2 glycoprotein (aB2GP) and the other one is liquid phase assays which identifies lupus anticoagulants (LAC) While aB2GP and acl are being detected most commonly by ELISA, LAC is being detected by clot based test. Lupus anticoagulant is a double misnomer as most patients don't have systemic lupus erythematous and in vivo reacts as procoagulants.		3	1.0989999771118164

Out of eight series of aluminium alloys, 2xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx aluminium alloys are susceptible to SCC. Among them, 7xxx series aluminium alloys have specific application in aerospace, military and structural industries due to superior mechanical properties. In these high strength 7xxx aluminium alloys, SCC plays a vital factor of consideration, as these failures are catastrophic during the service. The understanding of SCC behaviour possesses critical challenge for this alloy. The main aim of this review paper is to understand the effect of constituent alloying elements on the response of microstructural variation in various heat treated conditions on SCC behavior. Further, review was made for improving the SCC resistance using thermomechanical treatments and by surface modifications of 7xxx alloys. Apart from a brief review on SCC of 7xxx alloys, this paper presents the effect of stress and pre strain, effect of constituent alloying elements in the alloy, and the effect of environments on SCC behaviour.

The challenge in video object tracking is how to track accurately when the target is obscured. We use the frame difference method to detect the target and smooth the target trajectory by using Kalman filter. When the target is occluded, we can select the appropriate fitting section after smoothing trajectories and use the least square method to fit the target motion path adaptively, so we can predict the object location. By comparing the experimental results with the actual motion of the target, it shows that the algorithm can be used to track most of the occlusion targets precisely.	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP BMEI)	5	1.6089999675750732

It reduces the visibility of the scenes and lowers the reliability of outdoor surveillance systems; it reduces the clarity of the satellite images; it also changes the colors and decreases the contrast of daily photos, which is an annoying problem to photographers. Therefore, removing haze from images is an important and widely demanded topic in computer vision and computer graphics areas. The main challenge lies in the ambiguity of the problem. Haze attenuates the light reflected from the scenes, and further blends it with some additive light in the atmosphere. The target of haze removal is to recover the reflected light (i.e. the scene colors) from the blended light. This problem is mathematically ambiguous: there are an infinite number of solutions given the blended light. How can we know which solution is true? We need to answer this question in haze removal. Ambiguity is a common challenge for many computer vision problems. In terms of mathematics, ambiguity is because the number of equations is smaller than the number of unknowns. The methods in computer vision to solve the ambiguity can roughly categorized into two strategies. The first one is to acquire more known variables, e.g. some haze removal algorithms capture multiple images of the same scene under different settings (like polarizers).But it is not easy to obtain extra images in practice. The second strategy is to impose extra constraints using some knowledge or assumptions .All the images in this thesis are best viewed in the electronic version. This way is more practical since it requires as few as only one image. To this end, we focus on single image haze removal in this thesis. The key is to find a suitable prior. Priors are important in many computer vision topics. A prior tells the algorithm ""what can we know about the fact beforehand"" when the fact is not directly available. In general, a prior can be some statistical/physical properties, rules, or heuristic assumptions. The performance of the algorithms is often determined by the extent to which the prior is valid. Some widely used priors in computer vision are the smoothness prior, sparsity prior, and symmetry prior. In this thesis, we develop an effective but very simple prior, called the dark channel prior, to remove haze from a single image. The dark channel prior is a statistical property of outdoor haze free images: most patches in these images should contain pixels which are dark in at least one color channel. These dark pixels can be due to shadows, colorfulness, geometry, or other factors. This prior provides a constraint for each pixel, and thus solves the ambiguity of the problem. Combining this prior with a physical haze imaging model, we can easily recover high quality haze free images."		1395	7.241000175476074

However, a long period of elevated systemic venous pressure and low cardiac output after the procedure result in chronic inflammation and liver cirrhosis, which may eventually lead to the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Clinical Findings: We described the case of a 16 year old female who developed HCC after the FP. At 21 months, the patient received a lateral tunnel FP, and 14 years later, she began complaining of abdominal distension, telangiectasia, and fatigue. Imaging studies revealed a large hepatic mass involving most of the right lobe and multiple masses in the left lobe. Evidence suggested severe liver cirrhosis, and the presence of ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, paraesophageal gastric varices reflecting the severity of the disease. In addition, tumor thrombosis was found in the right hepatic vein, middle hepatic vein, and inferior vena cava, as well as multiple metastatic nodules in both lungs. The patient received an incisional biopsy and the diagnosis of HCC was pathologically confirmed. After treatment with 1 cycle of systemic chemotherapy, she received ongoing supportive care for disease related complications, and died 2 months after chemotherapy due to hematemesis. Conclusion: With the advances in medicine, the incidence of Fontan physiology related complications is likely to increase, and the incidence of HCC will also increase accordingly. As early diagnosis of HCC results in better patient outcomes, a surveillance guideline for HCC after the FP should be developed.	Medicine	36	3.5840001106262207
146	4722688	4722688	A Test of Concept Study of At Home, Self Administered HIV Testing With Web Based Peer Counseling Via Video Chat for Men Who Have Sex With Men	Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) particularly MSM who identify as African American or Black (BMSM) are the sociodemographic group that is most heavily burdened by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in the United States. To meet national HIV testing goals, there must be a greater emphasis on novel ways to promote and deliver HIV testing to MSM. Obstacles to standard, clinic based HIV testing include concerns about stigmatization or recognition at in person testing sites, as well as the inability to access a testing site due to logistical barriers. Objective This study examined the feasibility of self administered, at home HIV testing with Web based peer counseling to MSM by using an interactive video chatting method. The aims of this study were to (1) determine whether individuals would participate in at home HIV testing with video chat based test counseling with a peer counselor, (2) address logistical barriers to HIV testing that individuals who report risk for HIV transmission may experience, and (3) reduce anticipated HIV stigma, a primary psychosocial barrier to HIV testing. Methods In response to the gap in HIV testing, a pilot study was developed and implemented via mailed, at home HIV test kits, accompanied by HIV counseling with a peer counselor via video chat. A total of 20 MSM were enrolled in this test of concept study, 80% of whom identified as BMSM. Results All participants reported that at home HIV testing with a peer counseling via video chat was a satisfying experience. The majority of participants (13/18, 72% said they would prefer for their next HIV testing and counseling experience to be at home with Web based video chat peer counseling, as opposed to testing in an office or clinic setting. Participants were less likely to report logistical and emotional barriers to HIV testing at the 6 week and 3 month follow ups. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that self administered HIV testing with Web based peer counseling is feasible and that MSM find it to be a satisfactory means by which they can access their test results. This study can serve as a general guideline for future, larger scale studies of Web based HIV test counseling for MSM.	JMIR public health and surveillance	16	2.7730000019073486

"Transversality between mathematical modeling, pharmacology, and materials science is essential in order to achieve controlled release systems with advanced properties. In this regard, the area of biomaterials provides a platform for the development of depots that are able to achieve controlled release of a drug, whereas pharmacology strives to find new therapeutic molecules and mathematical models have a connecting function, providing a rational understanding by modeling the parameters that influence the release observed. Herein we present a mechanism which, based on reasonable assumptions, explains the experimental data obtained very well. In addition, we have developed a simple and accurate ""lumped"" kinetics model to correctly fit the experimentally observed drug release behavior. This lumped model allows us to have simple analytic solutions for the mass and rate of drug release as a function of time without limitations of time or mass of drug released, which represents an important step forward in the area of in vitro drug delivery when compared to the current state of the art in mathematical modeling. As an example, we applied the mechanism and model to the release data for acetazolamide from a recombinant polymer. Both materials were selected because of a need to develop a suitable ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of glaucoma. The in vitro release model proposed herein provides a valuable predictive tool for ensuring product performance and batch to batch reproducibility, thus paving the way for the development of further pharmaceutical devices."

148	21131871	21131871	Customer gender prediction based on E commerce data	Demographic attributes of customers such as gender, age, etc. provide important information for e commerce service providers in marketing and personalization of web applications. However, online customers often do not provide this kind of information due to privacy issues and other security related reasons. In this paper, we proposed a method for predicting the gender of customers based on their catalog viewing data on e commerce systems, such as the date and time of access, list of categories and products viewed, etc. We employ a machine learning approach and investigate a number of features derived from catalog viewing information to predict the gender of viewers. Experiments were conducted on datasets provided by the PAKDD'15 Data Mining Competition and achieved the good result. The results 81.2% on balanced accuracy and 81.4% on macro F1 score showed that basic features such as viewing time, products/categories features used together with more advanced features such as products/categories sequence and transfer features effectively facilitate gender prediction of customers.	2016 Eighth International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)	9	2.197000026702881

However, the random hidden weights of the randomized algorithms require suitable distributions in advance, and the deep learning methods do not use the output information in system identification.In this paper, the distributions of the hidden weights are obtained by the restricted Boltzmann machines. This deep learning method uses input data to construct the statistical features of the hidden weights. The output weights of the neural model are trained by normal randomized algorithms. So we successfully combine the unsupervised training (deep learning) and the supervised learning method (randomized algorithm) and take advantages from both of them. The proposed randomized algorithms with deep learning modification are validated with three benchmark problems.	Inf. Sci.	59	4.078000068664551

It is a dense, complex piece of history, frequently operating on several levels at once. It asks us to rethink the study of international legal history in fundamental ways, not least by redrawing the boundaries between imperial, international, and global legal regimes. The authors pursue these arguments through an exploration of a series of overlapping projects of legal reform which took place within the British empire, and on its peripheries, in the first half of the 19th century. The book's methodological claims are compelling; its contentions about the British imperial constitution are powerful, but not wholly persuasive. Approached, however, as a book about a set of themes rather than as an authoritative treatment of specific problems Rage for Order represents an immensely significant intervention in a wide range of debates.		62	4.126999855041504

These include conventional buckling braced frames and buckling restrained braced frames. Although the latter can prevent brace buckling and provide ductile behavior, both types of braces provide no hysteretic damping at small drift levels and offer very limited post yielding stiffness. This study proposes a new type of steel brace with a novel mechanism the naturally buckling brace (NBB) The design combines high strength and low yield steels arranged in parallel with a specified initial eccentricity along the brace length, providing ductile seismic behavior. Six tests of various NBB models subjected to cyclic loading were conducted to examine the seismic performance of the proposed NBB. Two specimens out of the six achieved the characteristics intended for NBB. The test results showed that the NBB specimens with appropriate design parameters could achieve early yielding, or hysteretic damping, from around 0.11% story drift and prevent local buckling as well as deformation concentration up to a very large story drift (greater than 3% A single NBB would provide an asymmetric hysteretic behavior, a large post yielding stiffness in tension, and a ductile performance with stable energy dissipation. Further systematic studies of NBBs are needed to comprehensively evaluate the capacities and limitations of the NBBs, including the reliability of performance with repeated tests.		11	2.3980000019073486

In other word, professor is deemed as successful as they have already established themselves in their area of specialisation. Career success can be also be classified into objective career success and subjective career success. The purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that influence the career success among women in the higher education institution in Malaysia by using individual, structural and behavioural approach. Specifically, the study focuses on University Teknologi Mara (UiTM) one of the largest Malaysian universities. Self esteem, an individual factor and career success is found to be significantly related to each other in this research. A person who has a high self esteem is more motivated and thus more likely to be committed in their career. Besides this, the person organisation fit in structural approach is positively related with career success. This is because the chemistry between organisation and employee is very important in order for the employee to fully apply their values in the organisation. Apart from this, perceived organisational support, a structural factor is found to affect career success. For the employee to achieve success, organisation should show their supportiveness to employee in an effort to motivate them to work. Hence, the factors identified using individual, structural and behavioural approach could become a set of strategies in enhancing the effectiveness and career success among the female academician in the field of academic.		3	1.0989999771118164

155	7211160	7211160	Cognitive Dysfunction in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder featuring obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors performed in the context of rigid rituals) There is strong evidence for a neurobiological basis of this disorder, involving limbic cortical regions and related basal ganglion areas. However, more research is needed to lift the veil on the precise nature of that involvement and the way it drives the clinical expression of OCD. Altered cognitive functions may underlie the symptoms and thus draw a link between the clinical expression of the disorder and its neurobiological etiology. Our extensive review demonstrates that OCD patients do present a broad range of neuropsychological dysfunctions across all cognitive domains (memory, attention, flexibility, inhibition, verbal fluency, planning, decision making) but some methodological issues temper this observation. Thus, future research should have a more integrative approach to cognitive functioning, gathering contributions of both experimental psychology and more fundamental neurosciences.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the rate of positivity of stress echocardiography (SE) over 27 consecutive years. METHODS We assessed the rate of SE positivity in 2007 patients without previous myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization who performed SE in a tertiary care referral center from 1983 to 2009. SE was performed with dipyridamole (1427) dobutamine (136) or exercise (444) RESULTS There was a progressive decline over time in the rate of SE positivity from 42% (1983 1991) to 22% (2001 2009) with a relative increase of patients with low pre test probability of disease (from 5% to 27% The percentage of patients studied with SE under anti ischemic therapy increased markedly (from 8% in the first to 61% in the last nine years) CONCLUSION Over 27 consecutive years, we observed a steady decline in SE positivity rate (with >5 fold increase of low probability patients) with almost 8 fold increase in anti ischemic therapy at testing. We probably need refined criteria of referral for testing and/or better ways to titrate the negative response beyond wall motion abnormalities during SE.

Today's manager's challenge is to keep the staff engaged and ensure attraction and retention of talented employees. The manager has to know the current acquisition and retention strategies employed by other organisations. The goal of most companies is to benefit from talented employee behavior and contribution in the workplace by promoting a win win situation for both the company and workers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effect of talent management strategies on employee retention in the insurance industry. This study was conducted within the insurance industry of which 5 Companies were sampled. The study was descriptive as the respondents only described the phenomena, but was not involved in any manipulation of the variables. The target population constituted 200 Assistant and Managers. Samples of 70 staff were selected based on simple random sampling method. Primary data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed using the SPSS package Version 21.0. Simple descriptive statistics was used to illustrate the various qualitative and quantitative factors that were conceptualized to influence the employee retention. The results were tabulated in form of frequency tables, pie charts and bar graphs to capture the number of responses to a particular variable in each determination. Further, the study adopted correlation and regression analysis at 5% level of significance to determine strength and direction of the relationship of the variables under study. The analysis showed that talent acquisition had the strongest positive (Pearson correlation coefficient .877) influence on employee retention. In addition, talent development, compensation strategies, succession planning are positively correlated to employee retention .588, .705, .0424 respectively).The study established that the management of the organization did not properly plan and manage career path. The succession plan strategy employed by the organisation has not improved their willingness to be retained in the organization. The study also recommends that on boarding programmes should help to ensure employees retention. The study can be conducted with emphasis to Kenyan owned companies with a more diverse group of employee. Also, different variables could be chosen that are different from the ones used in this study for the generalization of the findings of this study.

Thanks to a mathematical observation on the algebraic nature of the frictional wrench cone, we show that the 3D volume of feasible COM accelerations is always an upward pointing cone. We reduce its computation to a convex hull of (dual) 2D points, for which optimal C(n log n) algorithms are readily available. This reformulation brings a significant speedup compared to previous methods, which allows us to compute time varying contact stability criteria fast enough for the control loop. Next, we propose a conservative trajectory wide contact stability criterion, which can be derived from COM acceleration volumes at marginal cost and directly applied in a model predictive controller. We finally implement this pipeline and exemplify it with the HRP 4 humanoid model in multi contact dynamically walking scenarios.	2016 IEEE RAS 16th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	50	3.9119999408721924

To solve the problem, we propose a distributed optimization method by extending classical mirror descent algorithms to the distributed setting. We obtain the convergence of the algorithm under wild conditions that the agent communication follows a directed graph and the related weighted matrices are row stochastic. In particular, when the weighted matrices are restricted to be doubly stochastic, we provide the explicit convergence rate of the algorithm by choosing the stepsize in a suitable way. The proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the subgradient projection methods since it utilizes a customized Bregman divergence instead of the usual Euclidean squared distance. Finally, some simulation results on a matrix game are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity, 2016	Complex.	4	1.3860000371932983

This integrated nature and its upgrade toward an intelligent smart grid make the power grid vulnerable when facing cyber or physical attacks as well as intentional attacks. Therefore, determining the most vulnerable components (e.g. buses or generators) is critically important for power grid defense. In this paper, a new definition of load is proposed by taking power flow into consideration in comparison with the load definition based on degree or network connectivity. Unsupervised learning techniques (e.g. K means algorithm and self organizing map (SOM) are introduced to cluster the nodes (i.e. buses) in IEEE 39 bus and IEEE 57 bus benchmarks. Then most vulnerable node in each cluster is determined based on their load information to form initial victim set. We use percentage of failure (PoF) to compare the performance of clustering based approach and traditional load based approach during cascading failure process. With the simulation results, the unsupervised learning (clustering based) approaches are more efficient in finding the most vulnerable nodes and our proposed definition of load is relatively useful in studying power grid security.	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	8	2.0789999961853027

Privacy concerns have flooded the market especially in the public domain, and with the changing environment of software usage and involvement of malicious substances associated with any network, it becomes essential to safeguard and ascertain privacy among users and incorporate the same safeguard to protect privacy in software as well. The methodologies and tools architecting distributed enterprise resource planning ERP systems are primarily new and are vulnerable to malicious attacks. This paper aims at identifying some of critical privacy issues by collecting data from ERP practitioners. This work models variables associated with ERP with the variables of privacy to establish a robust adoption of ERP practices. Privacy issues concerning ERP are listed. Several variables associated with the development, implementation, and control of ERP are identified in the existing literature. A questionnaire instrument was distributed among a set of ERP practitioners. The response data collected thereby were analyzed statistically. Based upon the statistical analysis, an attempt has been made in the paper to make a ranking of the privacy factors. The observations are discussed in detail, and some specific conclusions have been made. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.	Int. J. Commun. Syst.	4	1.3860000371932983

We first employ game theory for linear systems and formulate the problem under study as a two agent game. Then, we solve the problem of unknown human's cost function by developing an estimation method based on the measured interaction force. In particular, the human's target position and control gain are estimated, respectively. At last, the estimated cost function is used as the robot's cost function to generate the robot control. Eventually, human robot coordination is achieved which indicates that the robot is able to interact with the human according to the human's control objective. Rigorous analysis and simulation studies are conducted to show the validity of the proposed method.	2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)	2	0.6930000185966492

Using Social Representation Theory to examine the moderating effects of tourism diversification on residents' tax paying behavior	Tourism authorities in the Las Vegas region have suggested the diversification of the tourism industry as a strategy to improve the vitality of rural communities outside of the metropolitan area. The present study uses Social Representation Theory as the conceptual basis to test the moderating effects of the various types of proposed tourism development on residents' willingness to pay higher taxes to support such development. A survey of 301 residents in Las Vegas rural communities examined how the factors of economic dependence on tourism, community attachment, and ecocentric attitude towards tourism influence residents' perceptions of tourism's impacts. A higher economic dependence on tourism and higher levels of community attachment led to more favorable perceptions of tourism's economic and social impacts. The economic impacts, in turn, resulted in a willingness to pay higher taxes, irrespective of the type of tourism development proposed by the Las Vegas authorities. The results suggest that rural communities reinforce a hegemonic social representation of tourism in order to characterize the ethos of capitalist urbanism that pervades the economic development discourse. The residents' social construction of tourism has important implications for tourism planners in the region and suggests the adoption of an inclusive tourism diversification strategy that leverages both gaming and alternative tourism.		23	3.134999990463257
169	138032544	138032544	Development of air plasma thermal spray coating for thermal barrier coating and oxidation resistance applications on Ni base super alloys	Aerospace gas turbine engines are now designed such that the heat resistant super alloys operate at temperature very close to their melting, so current strategies for performance improvement are centered on thermal barrier coatings. Lower thermal conductivities lead to temperature reductions at the substrate/bond coat interface which slows the rate of the thermally induced failure mechanisms. Alternatively, lower thermal conductivity TBC layers might allow designers to reduce the TBC thickness there by decreasing the significant centrifugal load that the mass of the TBC imposes on the rotating turbine engine components. One approach to improve TBC system is to optimize the pore morphologies to reduce the thermal conductivity while still retaining high in plane compliance. The second approach to improve TBC system performance is to optimize the surface microstructure, surface densification, phase structures mechanical characteristic, chemical structure, and thermo physical properties.		2	0.6930000185966492

He has a wealth of experience and a proven record of publications in the field. Indeed, Mark is an internationally renowned arboriculturist and combines a passion for trees with sound understanding of British social and cultural history. Furthermore, with the appetite whetted, the book does not disappoint. Most studies of garden and landscape history have been concerned with those belonging to the rich and powerful in cities and in towns. However, this book takes a wider sweep as it focuses especially on working people and their treescapes. The information provided with the book states that this is the first book on the history of trees in Britain's towns and cities and the people who have planted and cared for them. Furthermore, it is a highly readable account of the trees in our urban landscapes from the Romans to the present day, including public parks, private gardens, streets, cemeteries and many other open spaces. It is explained that the various threats to these trees over the centuries are described and these include as pollution damage during the Industrial Revolution, and for example, the impacts of diseases such as the ravages of Dutch Elm Disease. Current pests and diseases are not covered but that would need a completely different book! The various governmental initiatives over the years are examined along with the contributions of civic and amenity societies. Mark's historical account is much more than a catalogue of significant events in the history of urban trees, but provides a deeper, more thorough analysis. He does this by exploring fundamental issues such as the ownership of urban treed landscapes, and investigating why they were created, and who had access to them. Finally, the book concludes with the fascinating stories of how trees have contributed to efforts to improve urban conditions through various ""visions of the urban green"" such as the model villages, garden cities, garden suburbs and the new towns. The book is an essential and enjoyable read for all those interested in urban trees, and especially those within the arboricultural industry. Indeed the introductory chapter that provides an overview of the development of professional arboriculture should be a ""must read"" for all entering the profession. I hope that this much needed addition to the literature will also find an audience beyond the immediate profession for a wider public perhaps but especially for planners, architects and landscape architects."		9	2.197000026702881

In this paper, we explore the following questions: How has watershed management evolved? What new tools are available and how can they be integrated into sustainable watershed management? To address these questions, we discuss the process of developing integrated watershed management strategies for sustainable management through the incorporation of adaptive management techniques and traditional ecological knowledge. We address the numerous benefits from integration across disciplines and jurisdictional boundaries, as well as the incorporation of technological advancements, such as remote sensing, GIS, big data, and multi level social ecological systems analysis, into watershed management strategies. We use three case studies from China, Europe, and Canada to review the success and failure of integrated watershed management in addressing different ecological, social, and economic dilemmas in geographically diverse locations. Although progress has been made in watershed management strategies, there are still numerous issues impeding successful management outcomes; many of which can be remedied through holistic management approaches, incorporation of cutting edge science and technology, and cross jurisdictional coordination. We conclude by highlighting that future watershed management will need to account for climate change impacts by employing technological advancements and holistic, cross disciplinary approaches to ensure watersheds continue to serve their ecological, social, and economic functions. We present three case studies in this paper as a valuable resource for scientists, resource managers, government agencies, and other stakeholders aiming to improve integrated watershed management strategies and more efficiently and successfully achieve ecological and socio economic management objectives.

All such applications and environments need energy efficient routing. This has led to the evolution of hierarchical routing which has attracted many professionals towards this field for research and development. Hierarchical routing is energy efficient and useful in several situations. It can be basically categorized in two types. First one is typical hierarchical routing protocols and second one is atypical hierarchical routing protocols. However, there are no such significant differences between both of them because atypical protocols are just a subset of typical hierarchical routing protocols. There are various survey papers which focus on typical routing protocols and very few papers which cover especially atypical routing protocols. There is no such paper which covers both categories collectively which can ease users to compare them for the best suitability. This survey aims to fulfill the same requirement and covers some renowned protocols from both categories.	2016 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)	2	0.6930000185966492

Here, we found that the expression of miR 411 5p was downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with their matched adjacent non neoplastic tissues. In addition, the expression of miR 411 5p was also lower in breast cancer cell lines in contrast with MCF 10A. Moreover, we investigated the target and mechanism of miR 411 5p in breast cancer using mimic and inhibitor, and demonstrated the involvement of GRB2 and Ras activation. Ectopic expression of miR 411 5p suppressed the breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion while low expression of miR 411 5p exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore, GRB2 was demonstrated to be significantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues, and low expression of GRB2 had a longer overall survival compared with high expression of GRB2 in breast cancer. In general, our study shed light on the miR 411 5p related mechanism in the progression of breast cancer and, miR 411 5p/GRB2/Ras axis is potential to be molecular target for breast cancer therapy.

How and Why Circular and Angular Logo Shapes Influence Brand Attribute Judgments	Five experiments document that the mere circularity and angularity of a brand logo is powerful enough to affect perceptions of the attributes of a product or company. It is theorized and shown that circular versus angular logo shapes activate softness and hardness associations, respectively, and these concepts subsequently influence product/company attribute judgments through a resource demanding imagery generation process that utilizes the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory. There are no logo shape effects on attribute judgments when the visuospatial sketchpad component of working memory is constrained by irrelevant visual imagery, when people have a lower disposition to generate imagery when processing product information, and when the headline of the ad highlights a product attribute that differs from the inference drawn from the logo shape. Further, there are shape effects even when the shape is incidentally exposed beforehand using a priming technique rather than being a part of the logo itself, demonstrating the generalizability of our findings. When taken together, the results have implications for working memory, consumer imagery, and visual marketing.		106	4.663000106811523

178	14818318	14818318	Development of High Availability ATCA/PCIe Data Acquisition Instrumentation	"Latest Fusion energy experiments envisage a quasi continuous operation regime. In consequence, the largest experimental devices, currently in development, specify high availability (HA) requirements for the whole plant infrastructure. Highly available systems operate seamlessly in the case of component failure, ensuring safety of equipment, people, environment and investment. Control and Data Acquisition (C&DA) systems for Fusion diagnostics are considered mission critical and require high degrees of availability. IPFN developed a C&DA system for fast control of advanced Fusion devices, targeting HA. The hardware platform is based on in house developed Advanced Telecommunication Computing Architecture (ATCA) instrumentation modules digitizing and data switch blades using PCI Express (PCIe) over the ATCA backplane Fabric Channel Interface, connecting to an external PCIe host computer. At the hardware management level, the system architecture takes advantage of ATCA's HA characteristics, such as its redundant hardware components, redundant backplane topologies and Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) ""Hot Swap"" At the software level, PCIe supports ""Hot Plug"" graceful device insertion and removal. The implementation of PCIe Hot Plug for the ATCA form factor is one of the major tasks involved and a solution for such implementation was also developed. The paper describes how IPFN C&DA system can be setup to take advantage of both ATCA and PCIe features to perform with the desired degree of availability, by implementing fail over mechanisms based on the use of redundancy, thus being suitable for advanced C&DA systems in Fusion."

179	88515597	88515597	A Theoretical Framework for Calibration in Computer Models: Parametrization, Estimation and Convergence Properties	Calibration parameters in deterministic computer experiments are those attributes that cannot be measured or available in physical experiments. Kennedy and O'Hagan \cite{kennedy2001bayesian} suggested an approach to estimate them by using data from physical experiments and computer simulations. A theoretical framework is given which allows us to study the issues of parameter identifiability and estimation. We define the $L_2$ consistency for calibration as a justification for calibration methods. It is shown that a simplified version of the original KO method leads to asymptotically $L_2$ inconsistent calibration. This $L_2$ inconsistency can be remedied by modifying the original estimation procedure. A novel calibration method, called the $L_2$ calibration, is proposed and proven to be $L_2$ consistent and enjoys optimal convergence rate. A numerical example and some mathematical analysis are used to illustrate the source of the $L_2$ inconsistency problem.	SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantification	40	3.688999891281128

In those languages, very limited or no transcribed speech is available for traditional monolingual speech recognition. Conventional methods such as IPA based universal acoustic modeling has been proved to be effective under matched acoustic conditions (similar speaking styles, adjacent languages, etc. while usually poorly preformed when mismatch occurs. Since mismatch problems between languages often appears, in this paper, unsupervised acoustic modeling via cross lingual knowledge sharing has thus been proposed: first, initial acoustic models (AM) for a target zero resourced language are trained using Multi Task Deep Neural Networks (MDNN) different languages' speech mapped to the phonemes of the target language (mapped data) is jointly trained together with the same data transcribed language specifically and respectively (specific data) then, automatically transcribed target language data is used in the iterative process to train new AMs, with various auxiliary tasks.

Design/methodology/approach This work uses a qualitative research methodology involving an online user study questionnaire, supported by e mailed user screenshots and online conversations. Findings In terms of smartphone age, 72 per cent of the participants' smartphones were less than two years old. This high level of churn rate was anticipated and will please retailers and marketers alike. This study found that the majority of smartphone users regularly arrange their app icons and that their categorization principle was based primarily on application associated functionality and frequency of use. This group of users seemed less concerned about the risks of privacy and security, and even when they had lost or had their smartphone stolen, few (5.2 per cent) had suffered from fraud, in contrast to the general perception of risk. Originality/value This is one of the few studies to have investigated the area of smartphone use from the users' perspective, leading to important insights into application user behaviour and icon arrangement, and as well as alternative possible implications for launcher design.		4	1.3860000371932983

To fabricate efficient formamidinium tin iodide (FASnI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) it is essential to deposit uniform and dense perovskite layers and reduce Sn(4+ content. Here we used solvent engineering and nonsolvent dripping process with SnF2 as an inhibitor of Sn(4+ However, excess SnF2 induces phase separation on the surface of the perovskite film. In this work, we report the homogeneous dispersion of SnF2 via the formation of the SnF2 pyrazine complex. Consequently, we fabricated FASnI3 PSCs with high reproducibility, achieving a high power conversion efficiency of 4.8% Furthermore, the encapsulated device showed a stable performance for over 100 days, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency.

After a contract has been negotiated and agreed, all parties will need assurances that the service interactions comply with the clauses of the agreements between the parties, and that any violations are detected, prevented, and their causes identified. Because of the dynamic nature of emerging IoT and Cloud based relationships, there is a need for automated support for the monitoring and enforcement of service agreement policies. This paper develops a novel model for representing contract clauses using business rules that is specifically designed for contract compliance checking and enforcement. We identify what events need to be generated and captured from the underlying messaging middleware, and describe key design issues for a state aware contract monitoring and enforcement service.	2016 IEEE 18th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)	6	1.7920000553131104

"Due to the rapid development of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and increased competitions worldwide, more and more education institutions are making efforts to globalize their student recruitment strategies and to develop online distance education programs. The direct outcomes include continued growth of international student population in countries such as U.S. U.K. Australia, and Canada (Choudaha Chang, 2012) and the fast growing of online distance learning (ODL) market. This international education development trend has posed great challenges to educators working with international students.The need to examine how culture impacts ODL is well documented in the literature (Mclsaac Gunawardena, 1996; Moore, 1994; PhuongMai, Terlouw, Pilot, 2005; Pincas, 2001; Rogers, Graham, Mayes, 2007; Tan, 2009; Wong, 2007) Overlooking the critical role culture plays in online learning will lead to ""detrimental educational and psychological consequences"" (Chen Bennett, 2012, p. 677) and students will experience feelings of isolation, frustration, alienation, helpless, upset, anxious, or depressed (Chen Bennett, 2012) Szilagyi (2013) further indicates, ""the deeper cultural layers that affect their [students' learning process, such as communicative attitudes in class, relationship with the instructor and classmates remain tacit"" (p. 594).The purpose of this study, therefore, is to explore culture's impact on student sojourners' learning behaviors in Western online learning context. In this study, culture is defined as a set of beliefs and values shared by a group of individuals that guide each group member's behaviors (Bennett, 1993) People travelling to different cultures for a short period of time and then return home are considered as sojourners (Berry, Kim, Minde, Mok, 1987) As four of the eight top origin countries are influenced by Confucius culture and the major learning destination countries represent Western culture (Choudaha Chang, 2012) this study is specifically designed to examine culture's impact on the learning behaviors of student sojourners from Confucius culture studying in Western online learning context.RESEARCH METHODResearch question decides research method. Document analysis was employed in this study and peer reviewed journal articles were analyzed as primary research data. Focusing on understanding Confucius culture and its impact on online learning behaviors, we began our search by exploring popular education research databases, including ProQuest database, EBSCO, and ERIC. The following key words were used to collect useful research articles: culture, Confucius culture, online learning, e learning, and distance education. The search results were carefully examined and only those that treated culture and online learning as the main focus of the study were included in the next stage analysis. At the second phase of data collection, only those research studies studying Confucius culture and its impact on student sojourners' learning in ODL environment dominated by Western cultures were included. The reference lists of the articles collected through the second phase of data collection were examined as well to identify more related research studies. Our keyword search yielded 86 articles from the above databases and majority utilized qualitative research methods (i.e. interview, document anlaysis, etc.""Keywords in context"" technique was employed in data analysis (Onwuegbuzie, Leech Collins, 2012) This technique is useful when studying research literature because context matters. In our data collection process, it was noticed that culture means different things in different contexts. Unless the surrounding words are examined to understand in which context the published study is situated, it is difficult to find appropriate research studies to include in final data analysis. In other words, linking keywords used by the author to the surrounding words and the context, one can truly understand the underlying meaning the author wants to convey to the readers."		30	3.4010000228881836

The opinions of English language teachers in primary school in Jeddah (n=89) were collected through the use of one instrument which is questionnaire. The data were generated using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22(r) program. The results demonstrated that most of the teachers surveyed realize the pedagogical value of using songs when teaching English oral skills to Young Learner (YL) however, they do not use songs because of their religious and cultural beliefs. Therefore, it is suggested that teachers should be provided with chants that are free of musical instruments to avoid any controversies with cultural or religious beliefs. The development of a website that contains educational songs and is designed specifically to suit Saudi EFL teachers' needs is strongly recommended.		11	2.3980000019073486

192	124912967	124912967	A multiscale SPH method for simulating transient viscoelastic flows using bead spring chain model	Abstract In this article, a multiscale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is proposed to simulate transient viscoelastic flows by using a bead spring chain description of polymer molecule. This methodology couples macroscopic conservation equations for mass and momentum with a stochastic differential equation for bead spring chain dynamics, which can be solved by a three step semi implicit algorithm to obtain the polymeric stress. Accordingly, a closed form constitutive equation is not required. The multiscale SPH method is firstly verified by the plane Couette flow with Hookean and finitely extendable non linear elastic (FENE) bead spring chain models with the number of beads M 2, which correspond to Hookean and FENE dumbbell models, respectively. Results for the velocity and shear stress are in excellent agreement with the available numerical and analytical solutions in literature. Then, the numerical method is extended to simulate the plane Couette flow and Poiseuille flow with FENE bead spring chain model with M 2. In particular, some molecular information of bead spring chain such as the molecular stretch, the orientation angle and the mean configuration thickness are displayed. The influence of the number of beads M on the evolutions of the molecular information is also analyzed in detail. It is demonstrated that the multiscale SPH method proposed here is a promising computational tool for the multiscale simulations of transient viscoelastic flows.		16	2.7730000019073486
193	125237194	125237194	Perspectival Realism and Incompatible Models	I discuss the prospects of perspectival realism for resolving the problem of incompatible models or theories in scientific practice. My diagnosis is that the perspectivist can secure the 'realism' in her position only by employing suitable relations between the models. It is such relations that do the work, not the general philosophical claim about the perspectival nature of knowledge claims. But appeal to such relations has also been the preferred strategy of scientific realist approaches to the problem. With respect to the problem of incompatible models, then, it is not clear that perspectivism has a clear advantage even though the issue was among the motivating problems for proposing this view. I suggest, however, that the required inter model relations (typically limit relations) embody a narrower notion of perspective, a notion that is explicitly part of the models themselves and that is essential in maintaining a realist view.		2	0.6930000185966492

Bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNF) in dry form could be used as reinforcements in hydrophobic polymer matrices like polylactic acid (PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates for biomedical applications. In this work, BCNF were obtained by simple eco friendly mechanical treatments applied to BC pellicles, consisting in successive wet and dry mechanical disintegration steps or only wet mechanical disintegration followed by freeze drying. The defibrillation processes did not modify the allomorph composition of BC, characterized by the preponderance of Ia compared to Ib form, but determined an increase of crystallinity, from 81% to 84 85% Morphological investigations revealed that the pellicles were entirely disintegrated by the mechanical treatments. AFM Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Mapping revealed unexpected detachment of small fibers from the BC ribbons at regular intervals, which was proved so far only for cellulose nanofibers from plants. PLA composites obtained with these BCNF showed higher modulus with almost 30% compared to the matrix. Dried BCNF prepared by these eco friendly approaches are good reinforcements for bionanocomposites for ""in vivo"" or ""ex vivo"" application, due to their high purity."		30	3.4010000228881836

We used seasonal data from >15,000 groundwater observation wells between 2005 and 2013, distributed all over the country. Two recently released GRACE products, RL05 spherical harmonics (SH) and RL05 mascon (MS) products are used for comparison with in situ data. To our knowledge, this is the first study of comparing the performance of two independent GRACE products at a sub continental scale. Also for the first time, we have created a high resolution (0.1 0 x 0.1 0 map of specific yield for the entire country that was used for calculating GWS. Observed GWS anomalies have been computed using water level anomalies and specific yield information for the locale of individual observation wells that are up scaled to basin scale in order to compare with GRACE based estimates. In general GRACE based estimates match well (on the basis of the statistical analyses performed in the study) with observed estimates in most of the river basins. On comparing with observed GWS anomaly, GRACE SH estimates match well in terms of RMSE, while GRACE MS estimates show better association in terms of correlation, while the output of skewness, kurtosis, coefficient of variation (CV) and scatter analyses remain inconclusive for inter comparison between two GRACE estimates. We used a non parametric trend estimation approach, the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter, to further assess the performance of the two GRACE estimates. GRACE MS estimates clearly outperform GRACE SH estimates for reproducing observed GWS anomaly trends with significantly >95% confidence level) strong association in 10 out of 12 basins for GRACE MS estimates, on the other hand, GRACE SH estimates show significantly >95% confidence level) strong association in 6 out of 12 basins. On the basis of the study output, we recommend using GRACE MS estimates for groundwater studies over the region and other regions of the globe with similar climatic, hydrogeologic or groundwater withdrawal conditions.		79	4.36899995803833

Recent work typically represents a 3D shape as a set of binary variables corresponding to 3D voxels of a uniform 3D grid centered on the shape, and resorts to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for modeling these binary variables. Robust learning of such CNNs is currently limited by the small datasets of 3D shapes available an order of magnitude smaller than other common datasets in computer vision. Related work typically deals with the small training datasets using a number of ad hoc, hand tuning strategies. To address this issue, we formulate CNN learning as a beam search aimed at identifying an optimal CNN architecture namely, the number of layers, nodes, and their connectivity in the network as well as estimating parameters of such an optimal CNN. Each state of the beam search corresponds to a candidate CNN. Two types of actions are defined to add new convolutional filters or new convolutional layers to a parent CNN, and thus transition to children states. The utility function of each action is efficiently computed by transferring parameter values of the parent CNN to its children, thereby enabling an efficient beam search. Our experimental evaluation on the 3D ModelNet dataset demonstrates that our model pursuit using the beam search yields a CNN with superior performance on 3D shape classification than the state of the art.	2016 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	39	3.6640000343322754

In this paper, we look into AAM fitting algorithms and make the following orthogonal contributions: We present a simple ""project out"" optimization framework that unifies and revises the most well known optimization problems and solutions in AAMs. Based on this framework, we describe robust simultaneous AAM fitting algorithms the complexity of which is not prohibitive for current systems. We then go on one step further and propose a new approximate project out AAM fitting algorithm which we coin Extended Project Out Inverse Compositional (E POIC) In contrast to current algorithms, E POIC is both efficient and robust. Next, we describe a part based AAM employing a translational motion model, which results in superior fitting and convergence properties. We also show that the proposed AAMs, when trained ""in the wild"" using SIFT descriptors, perform surprisingly well even for the case of unseen unconstrained images. Via a number of experiments on unconstrained human and animal face databases, we show that our combined contributions largely bridge the gap between exact and current approximate methods for AAM fitting and perform comparably with state of the art face alignment systems."

We implement basic recurrent neural networks (RNN) and refined RNNs with long short term memory (LSTM) cells. We use the corpora of Penn Tree Bank (PTB) and AMI in English, and the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus (ASBC) in Chinese. On ASBC, we investigate word based and character based language models. For character based language models, we look into the cases where the inter word space is treated or not treated as a token. In summary, we report and comment on the performance of RNN language models with different databases, network topology, language, and granularity.	2016 International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP)	9	2.197000026702881

As one of the first large scale studies, the impact of personality traits on mobile app adoption was examined through an empirical study involving 2043 Android users. A mobile app was developed to assess each smartphone user's personality traits based on a state of the art Big Five questionnaire and to collect information about her installed apps. The contributions of this work are two fold. First, it confirms that personality traits have significant impact on the adoption of different types of mobile apps. Second, a machine learning model is developed to automatically determine a user's personality based on her installed apps. The predictive model is implemented in a prototype app and shows a 65% higher precision than a random guess. Additionally, the model can be deployed in a non intrusive, low privacy concern, and highly scalable manner as part of any mobile app. Personality has a significant impact on mobile app adoption.A novel approach is proposed to study mobile app adoption on a large scale.A machine learning model is developed to predict a smartphone user's personality.The predictive model can be integrated into any mobile app.	Comput.
