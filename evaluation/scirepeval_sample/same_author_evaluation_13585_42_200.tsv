We show that, for any constant k?0, k-term monotone decision lists are exactly and properly learnable with nO(k) membership queries in nO(k3) time.

In contrast, both k-term monotone decision lists (k?2) and general monotone term decision lists are not learnable with equivalence queries alone.

Rule Based Information Retrieval by Computer (RUBRIC) is one of the approaches proposed to achieve this goal. This approach involves the use of production rules to capture user-query concepts (or topics). In RUBRIC, a set of related production rules is represented as an AND/OR tree, or alternatively by a disjunction of Minimal Term Sets (MTSs). The retrieval output is determined by the evaluation of the weighted Boolean expressions of the AND/OR tree, and processing efficiency can be enhanced by employing MTSs. However, since the weighted Boolean expression ignores the term-term association unless it is explicitly represented in the tree, the terminological gap between users' queries and their information needs may still remain. To solve this problem, we adopt the generalized vector space model (GVSM) and the p-norm based extended Boolean model.

While spatial fading correlation reduces the diversity gains, rank deficiency due to double scattering or keyhole effects decreases the spatial multiplexing gains of multiple-antenna channels. In this paper, taking into account realistic propagation environments in the presence of spatial fading correlation, double scattering, and keyhole effects, we analyze the ergodic (or mean) MIMO capacity for an arbitrary finite number of transmit and receive antennas. We assume that the channel is unknown at the transmitter and perfectly known at the receiver so that equal power is allocated to each of the transmit antennas. Using some statistical properties of complex random matrices such as Gaussian matrices, Wishart (1928) matrices, and quadratic forms in the Gaussian matrix, we present a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of independent Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels and a tight upper bound for spatially correlated/double scattering MIMO channels.

The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton interaction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias events. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged track momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at {radical}(s)=1800 GeV and {radical}(s)=630 GeV and comparing this ambient momentum with that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two Monte Carlo models. Two cones in {eta}-{phi} space are defined, at the same pseudorapidity, {eta}, as the jet with the highest transverse energy (E{sub T}{sup (1)}), and at {+-}90{sup o} in the azimuthal direction, {phi}.

We include new data from the final 2005 observing season, expanding the number of detector hours by 210% and the sky coverage by 490% over that used for the previous ACBAR release. As a result, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third to fifth acoustic peaks as well as the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration uncertainty has been reduced from 6% to 2.1% in temperature through a direct comparison of the CMB anisotropy measured by ACBAR with that of the dipole-calibrated WMAP5 experiment. The measured power spectrum is consistent with a spatially flat, ΛCDM cosmological model. We include the effects of weak lensing in the power spectrum model computations and find that this significantly improves the fits of the models to the combined ACBAR+WMAP5 power spectrum. The preferred strength of the lensing is consistent with theoretical expectations. On fine angular scales, there is weak evidence (1.1σ) for excess power above the level expected from primary anisotropies. We expect any excess power to be dominated by the combination of emission from dusty protogalaxies and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the excess observed by ACBAR is significantly smaller than the excess power at l > 2000 reported by the CBI experiment operating at 30 GHz. Therefore, while it is unlikely that the CBI excess has a primordial origin; the combined ACBAR and CBI results are consistent with the source of the CBI excess being either the SZE or radio source contamination."", 'corpus_id': 9604492, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '17494605', 'title': 'Improved Measurements of the CMB Power Spectrum with ACBAR', 'abstract': ""We report improved measurements of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation made with the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR). In this paper, we use a new analysis technique and include 30% more data from the 2001 and 2002 observing seasons than the first release to derive a new set of band-power measurements with significantly smaller uncertainties. The planet-based calibration used previously has been replaced by comparing the flux of RCW 38 as measured by ACBAR and BOOMERANG to transfer the WMAP-based BOOMERANG calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical predictions for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated ΛCDM cosmology, including the effects of gravitational lensing. Despite the exponential damping on small angular scales, the primary CMB fluctuations are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 4, up to multipoles of l = 2000. This increase in the precision of the fine-scale CMB power spectrum leads to only a modest decrease in the uncertainties on the parameters of the standard cosmological model. At high angular resolution, secondary anisotropies are predicted to be a significant contribution to the measured anisotropy. A joint analysis of the ACBAR results at 150 GHz and the CBI results at 30 GHz in the multipole range 2000 < l < 3000 shows that the power, reported by CBI in excess of the predicted primary anisotropy, has a frequency spectrum consistent with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and inconsistent with primary CMB.

A total of 730 H I detections are cataloged within the solid angle 11h44m 6.5, (2) high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way or its periphery, and (3) signals of lower S/N (to ~4.5) which coincide spatially with an optical object of known similar redshift. Although this region of the sky has been heavily surveyed by previous targeted observations based on optical flux- or size-limited samples, 69% of the extracted sources are newly reported H I detections. The resulting positional accuracy of H I sources is dependent on S/N: it averages 24'' (20'' median) for all sources with S/N > 6.5 and is of order ~17'' (14'' median) for signals with S/N > 12. The median redshift of the sample is ~7000 km s-1, and its distribution reflects the known local large-scale structure including the Virgo Cluster and the void behind it, the A1367-Coma supercluster at cz ~ 7000 km s-1, and a third, more distant overdensity at cz ~ 13,000 km s-1. Distance uncertainties in and around the Virgo Cluster perturb the derived H I mass distribution. Specifically, an apparent deficiency of the lowest H I mass objects can be attributed, at least in part, to the incorrect assignment of some foreground objects to the cluster distance. Several extended H I features are found in the vicinity of the Virgo Cluster. A small percentage (6%) of H I detections have no identifiable optical counterpart, more than half of which are high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way vicinity; the remaining 17 objects do not appear connected to or associated with any known galaxy.

The key difference between polytropic quark stars and the polytropic model studied previously for normal (i.e. non-quarkian) stars is related to two issues: (i) a constant term representing the contribution of vacuum energy may be added in the energy density and the pressure for a quark star, but not for a normal star; (ii) the quark star models with non-vanishing density at the stellar surface are not avoidable due to the strong interaction between quarks. The first one implies that the vacuum inside a quark star is different from that outside, while the second one is relevant to the effect of color confinement. The polytropic equations of state are stiffer than that derived in conventional realistic models (e.g. the bag model) for quark matter, and pulsar-like stars calculated with a polytropic equation of state could then have high maximum masses ( > 2 M ⊙ ) . Quark stars can also be very low massive, and be still gravitationally stable even if the polytropic index, n , is greater than 3. All these would result in different mass-radius relations, which could be tested by observations. In addition, substantial strain energy would develop in a solid quark star during its accretion/spindown phase, and could be high enough to take a star-quake.

There are multiple competing models for the knee giving conflicting predictions about this change for different masses of the primary particle. Accurate mass measurements of cosmic rays spectra around 3 PeV would be able to exclude some of these models. Cosmic-ray experiment EMMA uses a new method for studying the composition of cosmic rays at the knee area. It is able to determine the multiplicity, the lateral distribution, and the arrival direction of incoming muons produced early in the shower evolution on an event-by-event basis and deduce from these measurements the mass and the energy of the primary particle. EMMA is situated at the depth of 75 m in the Pyhasalmi mine, Finland. This rock overburden, which corresponds to 210 m of water equivalent, gives EMMA a cut-off energy of 50 GeV for vertical muons. Since the simulations using different air-shower models give similar predictions for the lateral distribution of these high energy muons, we are confident that EMMA should yield a reliable and an air-shower model independent data on the composition of cosmic rays around the knee region.', 'corpus_id': 119918558}	[{'doc_id': '121158687', 'title': 'High-K four-quasiparticle states in Gd-138', 'abstract': 'States above the known K(pi) = 8(-) 6 mu s isomer in (138)Gd have been populated with the (106)Cd((36)Ar,2p2n) reaction at a beam energy of 180 MeV at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland.

Rule Based Information Retrieval by Computer (RUBRIC) is one of the approaches proposed to achieve this goal. This approach involves the use of production rules to capture user-query concepts (or topics). In RUBRIC, a set of related production rules is represented as an AND/OR tree, or alternatively by a disjunction of Minimal Term Sets (MTSs). The retrieval output is determined by the evaluation of the weighted Boolean expressions of the AND/OR tree, and processing efficiency can be enhanced by employing MTSs. However, since the weighted Boolean expression ignores the term-term association unless it is explicitly represented in the tree, the terminological gap between users' queries and their information needs may still remain. To solve this problem, we adopt the generalized vector space model (GVSM) and the p-norm based extended Boolean model. Experiments are performed for two variations of the RUBRIC model, extended with GVSM, as well as for the integrated use of RUBRIC with the p-norm based extended Boolean model.

This is in apparent contradiction with the Λ cold dark matter (CDM) simulations of the Aquarius Project, which suggest that MW-sized haloes should have at least eight subhaloes with Vmax > 30 km\u2009s−1. The absence of luminous satellites in such massive subhaloes is thus puzzling and may present a challenge to the ΛCDM paradigm. We note, however, that the number of massive subhaloes depends sensitively on the (poorly known) virial mass of the MW, and that their scarcity makes estimates of their abundance from a small simulation set like Aquarius uncertain. We use the Millennium Simulation series and the invariance of the scaled subhalo velocity function (i.e. the number of subhaloes as a function of ν, the ratio of the subhalo Vmax to the host halo virial velocity, V200) to secure improved estimates of the abundance of rare massive subsystems. In the range 0.1 ν) is approximately Poisson distributed about an average given by 〈Nsub〉 = 10.2\u2009(ν/0.15)−3.11. This is slightly lower than that in Aquarius haloes, but consistent with recent results from the Phoenix Project. The probability that a ΛCDM halo has three or fewer subhaloes with Vmax above some threshold value, Vth, is then straightforward to compute. It decreases steeply both with decreasing Vth and with increasing halo mass. For Vth = 30 km\u2009s−1, ∼40 per cent of Mhalo = 1012\u2009M⊙ haloes pass the test; fewer than ∼5 per cent do so for Mhalo ≳\u20092 × 1012\u2009M⊙ and the probability effectively vanishes for Mhalo ≳\u20093 × 1012\u2009M⊙.

Most of these transit candidates have orbital periods longer than 100?days and 20 are potentially located in the habitable zones of their host stars. Nine candidates were detected with only two transit events and the prospective periods are longer than 400?days. The photometric models suggest that these objects have radii that range between those of Neptune and Jupiter. These detections nearly double the number of gas-giant planet candidates orbiting at habitable-zone distances. We conducted spectroscopic observations for nine of the brighter targets to improve the stellar parameters and we obtained adaptive optics imaging for four of the stars to search for blended background or foreground stars that could confuse our photometric modeling.

For example, an attack carried out through the wireless network interface may eventually provide access to the phone functionality. This type of attacks can cause considerable damage because some of the services (e.g., the GSM-based services) charge the user based on the traffic or time of use. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks by developing a proof-of-concept exploit that crosses service boundaries. To address these security issues, we developed a solution based on resource labeling. We modified the kernel of an integrated wireless device so that processes and files are marked in a way that allows one to regulate the access to different system resources. Labels are set when certain network services are accessed. The labeling is then transferred between processes and system resources as a result of either access or execution. We also defined a language for creating labeling rules, and demonstrated how the system can be used to prevent attacks that attempt to cross service boundaries.

The stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the AGN in the central 10 pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to ~1013 L☉ kpc−2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeds 104 M☉ pc−2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited and hence inevitably short lived, implying that the starbursts occur in multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50-100 Myr between the onset of star formation and subsequent fueling of the black hole. We discuss whether this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in fueling the black hole.

Beam test results on energy resolution, constant term suppression, lineshape, uniformity of response, shower position resolution, and electron-pion discrimination are presented. The readout of the fibres in the straight modules, which are sensitive to most of the electromagnetic showers and to part of the hadronic showers, is kept separate from the readout of the fibres of the wedged sections, which are sensitive only to hadronic showers. The lead-to-fibre volume ratio is kept at about 4 to 1 in order to obtain an equal-amplitude response from electrons and hadrons (usually called “compensation”). The origin of the energy resolution constant term has been better understood. This allowed the reduction of the constant term to 0.5%, down from 1.2% measured in older prototypes. The probability of faking abnormally large signals because of channelling effects is also discussed. The position resolution has been measured to range from 0.5 to 1 mm depending on the hit position of the particle. A comparison with the larger hexagonal module design is also made. The efficiency of a hardware thresholding of the wedges' signal as a level one trigger pion veto is discussed along with off-line electron/pion discrimination performances. Since the wedges start at 26 X 0 from the calorimeter front face they should show no signal for electromagnetic showers. It was found that electromagnetic showers of 50 GeV generate wedge signals of a maximum of a few tens of MeV. It was also found that the discriminating power is angle dependent, mainly because at small particle-to-fibre angles (≤ 1°) some electrons can penetrate the calorimeter through channeling, thus exciting a signal in the wedges. At slightly higher tilt angle it is possible to use a lower wedge threshold without loss in electron efficiency. With a beam-to-fibre angle of 3°, 99.6% of pions are rejected with a 98.5% electron efficiency.

Although there exist some systems allowing the user to query the discovered rules, they are less suitable for complex ad hoc querying of multiple data mining rulebases to retrieve interesting rules. In this paper, we propose a new powerful rule query language Rule-QL for querying multiple rulebases that is modeled after SQL and has rigorous theoretical foundations of a rule-based calculus. In particular, we first propose a rule-based calculus RC based on the first-order logic, and then present the language Rule-QL that is at least as expressive as the safe fragment of RC.

It has been studied by many data mining researchers. The issue is that data mining algorithms often generate too many patterns, which make it very hard for the user to find those truly useful ones. Over the years many techniques have been proposed. However, few have made it to real-life applications. At the end of 2005, we built a data mining system for Motorola (called Opportunity Map) to enable the user to explore the space of a large number of rules in order to find actionable knowledge. The approach is based on the concept of rule cubes and operations on rule cubes. A rule cube is similar to a data cube, but stores rules. Since its deployment, some issues have also been identified during the regular use of the system in Motorola. One of the key issues is that although the operations on rule cubes are flexible, each operation is primitive and has to be initiated by the user. Finding a piece of actionable knowledge typically involves many operations and intense visual inspections, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. From interactions with our users, we identified a generic problem that is crucial for finding actionable knowledge. The problem involves extensive comparison of sub-populations and identification of the cause of their differences. This paper first defines the problem and then proposes an effective method to solve the problem automatically. To the best of our knowledge, there is no reported study of this problem.

Let us use forum discussions about products as an example to make the problem concrete. In a typical discussion post, the author may give opinions on multiple products and also compare them. The issue is how to detect what products have been talked about in each sentence. If the sentence contains the product names, they need to be identified. We call this problem entity discovery.

Figure 1 show an Overall Layout of HIRFL-CSR. CSR is a multi-purpose CSR system that consists of a main ring (CSRm), an experimental ring (CSRe), and a radioactive beam line (RIBLL II) to connect the two rings. The two existing cyclotrons SFC (K = 69) and SSC (K = 450) of the HIRFL will be used as its injector system. The heavy ion beams with the energy range of 8–30 MeV/u from the HIRFL will be accumulated, cooled and accelerated to the high-energy range of 100–400 MeV/u in the main ring, and then extracted fast to produce RIB or highly charged heavy ions. The secondary beams (RIB or highly charged heavy ions) will be accepted and stored by the experimental ring for many internal-target experiments or high-precision spectroscopy with beam cooling. On the other hand, the beams with the energy range of 100–900 MeV/u will also be extracted from CSRm by using slow extraction or fast extraction for many external-target experiments."", 'corpus_id': 55936689}"	[{'doc_id': '17261464', 'title': 'Black hole to bulge mass correlation in Active Galactic Nuclei: a test for the simple unified formation scheme', 'abstract': 'A mass correlation of central black holes and their spheroids similar to 0.002 (within a factor of three) is suggested by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and various ground-based CCD photometries of early type galaxies.

On the other hand, recent reverberation mapping of a sample of Seyferts shows a broad distribution of black hole to bulge mass ratio with a mean of similar to 10(-3.5), about one magnitude lower than the value in early type galaxies and bright QSOs. Adopting a simple unified formation scheme for QSOs and Seyferts, we will discuss in this letter the dependence of the black hole to bulge mass ratio in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) on the environmental parameters of the host galaxies. We show a broad distribution of the mass correlation could be due to different velocity dispersion of the accreting gas from different Formation mechanism, and the mass ratio in normal galaxies and bright QSOs is probably a limit case of black hole evolution by merger enhanced accretion close to Eddington limit.', 'corpus_id': 17261464, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '145039581', 'title': 'Contribution of starburst mergers at z ∼ 1 to the strong evolution of infrared and submillimeter deep surveys', 'abstract': 'Recent far-infrared and submillimetre waveband observations revealed a large number of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIGs) with infrared luminosities >10 L . These sources are proposed to lie at redshifts above one, and in normally interacting systems with very dusty environments. We discussed in a previous paper that a population with a fast evolving infrared burst phase triggered by gas-rich mergers at z ∼ 1 predicted successfully the steep slope of faint IRAS 60 μm source counts within the flux range of 100 mJy ∼ 1 Jy, still leaving the infrared background level at this wavelength compatible with the upper limit from recent high energy TeV γ ray detection of Mrk 501. To extend the model to mid and far infrared wavelengths, we adopt a reasonable template spectral energy distribution typical for nearby-infrared-bright starburst galaxies (Lir <= 10 12 L ), such as Arp 220. We construct the SED for the dusty starburst mergers at z ∼ 1 by a simple dust extinction law and a thermal continuum assumption for the far-infrared emission. Since the radiation process at mid-infrared for these starburst merging systems is still uncertain, we assume it is similar to the MIR continuum of Arp 220, but modify it by the observed flux correlation of ULIGs from IRAS and ISOCAM deep surveys. We show in this paper that the strong evolution of the European Large Area ISO Survey (ELAIS) at 90μm, ISO 170μm and the Submillimeter deep survey at 850μm could be sufficiently accounted for by such an evolutionary scenario, especially the hump of the ISOCAM 15μm source count around 0.4 mJy. From current best fit results, we find that the dust temperature of those extremely bright starburst merging system at z ∼ 1 would be higher than that of Arp 220 for a reconciliation of the multi-wavelength infrared deep surveys. We thus propose that the infrared burst phase of dusty starburst galaxies or AGNs from gas-rich mergers at z ∼ 1 could contribute significantly to the strong evolution of the IRAS 60μm, the ISO 15μm, 90μm, 170μm, as well as the SCUBA 850μm number counts, while being compatible with the current observational limits of the cosmic infrared background and the redshift distributions. The major difference of our current model prediction is that we see a fast convergence of the differential number counts at 60μm below 50 mJy, which is about a factor of two brighter than other model predictions.

Based on our previous work regarding such a joint evolutionary scheme and the consequential black hole-to-bulge mass correlation, we use the X-ray luminosity function of AGN and the cosmological evolution rate, which are from ROSAT X-ray surveys, to estimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black hole growth. By the basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during the luminous AGN phase, the luminosity function of AGNs as a function of redshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the cosmic star formation history of the spheroids. Although the space density of the especially luminous quasars is very low, we show that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black hole growth is almost the same as that of Lyman break galaxies detected by the current optical deep surveys. We thus argue that the optical deep surveys may miss about half of the net star formation in our universe. This is probably due in part to significant dust extinction, as well as the small field of view of previous optical surveys, which cannot sample such rare events with relatively short timescale.

Weighted Hausdorff distance is proposed to assign all of the word objects from both the query document and the document from database to corresponding classes by an unsupervised classifier, whereas the possible stop words are excluded. Document vectors are built by the occurrence frequency of the word object classes, and the pair-wise similarity of two document images is represented by the scalar product of the document vectors.

We employ laboratory experiments in our study and our results indicate two interesting findings. First, when the permanent buyout option is available, a buyer is more likely to exhibit loss aversion characteristics and prefer to adopt the buyout strategy.

We take a fresh look at IEEE 802.11 WLANs, and using a combination of experiment, simulation, and analysis demonstrate its surprisingly agile performance traits. Our main findings are two-fold. First, contention-based MAC throughput degrades gracefully under congested conditions, enabled by physical layer channel diversity that reduces the effective level of MAC contention. In contrast, fairness and jitter significantly degrade at a critical offered load. This duality obviates the need for link layer flow control for throughput improvement but necessitates traffic control for fairness and QoS. Second, TCP-over-WLAN achieves high throughput commensurate with that of wireline TCP under saturated conditions, challenging the widely held perception that TCP throughput fares poorly over WLANs when subject to heavy contention. We show that TCP-over-WLAN prowess is facilitated by the self-regulating actions of DCF and TCP congestion control that jointly drive the shared physical channel at an effective load of 2--3 wireless stations, even when the number of active stations is very large.

In a realistic client/server network the degree to which file sizes are heavy-tailed can directly determine the degree of traffic self-similarity at the link level. This causal relationship is robust relative to changes in network resources, network topology, the influence of cross-traffic, and the distribution of interarrival times.

Using a hydrodynamical simulation to link the H I absorption to the density and temperature of the absorbing gas, and a model for the UV background radiation, we convert ratios of C IV to H I pixel optical depths into carbon abundances. For the median metallicity this technique was described and tested in Paper I of this series. Here we generalize it to reconstruct the full probability distribution of the carbon abundance and apply it to 19 high-quality quasar absorption spectra. We find that the carbon abundance is spatially highly inhomogeneous and is well described by a lognormal distribution for fixed δ and z. Using data in the range log δ = -0.5-1.8 and z = 1.8-4.1, and a renormalized version of the 2001 Haardt & Madau model for the UV background radiation from galaxies and quasars, we measure a median metallicity of [C/H] = -3.47 + 0.08(z - 3) + 0.65(log δ - 0.5) and a lognormal scatter of σ([C/H]) = 0.76 + 0.02(z - 3) - 0.23(log δ - 0.5). Thus, we find significant trends with overdensity but no evidence for evolution. These measurements imply that gas in this density range accounts for a cosmic carbon abundance of [C/H] = -2.80 ± 0.13 (ΩC ≈ 2 × 10-7), with no evidence for evolution. The dominant source of systematic error is the spectral shape of the UV background, with harder spectra yielding higher carbon abundances. While the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the spectral hardness may exceed the quoted statistical errors for δ < 10, we stress that UV backgrounds that differ significantly from our fiducial model give unphysical results. The measured lognormal scatter is strictly independent of the spectral shape, provided the background radiation is uniform.

There is excellent agreement for the TFPDF if the mean transmitted flux is adjusted to match the observations.

However, the rapid accumulation of gene expression pattern data over the last two decades, facilitated by high-throughput techniques, has produced a need for the development of efficient approaches for direct comparison of images, rather than their textual descriptions, to identify spatially similar expression patterns.ResultsThe effectiveness of the Binary Feature Vector (BFV) and Invariant Moment Vector (IMV) based digital representations of the gene expression patterns in finding biologically meaningful patterns was compared for a small (226 images) and a large (1819 images) dataset. For each dataset, an ordered list of images, with respect to a query image, was generated to identify overlapping and similar gene expression patterns, in a manner comparable to what a developmental biologist might do. The results showed that the BFV representation consistently outperforms the IMV representation in finding biologically meaningful matches when spatial overlap of the gene expression pattern and the genes involved are considered.

Therefore, one may identify the landmarks or the state of affairs that must be brought about during the execution of a protocol in order to achieve its goal. Accordingly, the most important aspect of protocols is these landmarks rather than the communicative actions needed to achieve the landmarks. We show that families of conversation protocols can be expressed formally as partially ordered landmarks where each landmark is characterized by propositions that are true in the state represented by that landmark. Dialogue in natural languages is regarded as joint activity. Conversation protocols in multi-agent systems are treated as dialogue templates and are composed using speech acts from natural language dialogues. As such, we treat conversation protocols as joint action expressions and gainfully apply existing formal theories of dialogue, specifically the Joint Intention Theory, to protocols and their compositions. Conversation protocols may require agents to communicate with groups as well as individuals. However, most contemporary agent communication languages, notably FIPA and KQML, have either no provision or no well-defined semantics for group communication.

One major source of difficulty is protecting concurrent accesses to shared data with an appropriate synchronization mechanism.

Transactional memory is an alternative mechanism that makes parallel programming easier. With transactional memory, a transaction provides atomic and serializable operations on an arbitrary set of memory locations. When a transaction commits, all operations within the transaction become visible to other threads. When it aborts, all operations in the transaction are rolled back.Transactional memory can be implemented in either hardware or software. A straightforward hardware approach can have high performance, but imposes strict limits on the amount of data updated in each transaction. A software approach removes these limits, but incurs high overhead.

In conventional generative methods, a generative model is learnt for each class using all the available training data belonging to that class. However, if an input image has been generated from only a subset of the model support, use of the full model to assign generative probabilities can produce serious artifacts in the probability assignments. This problem arises mainly when the different classes have multimodal distributions with considerable overlap in the feature space. We propose an approach to constrain the class generative probability of a set of newly observed data by exploiting the distribution of the new data itself and using linear weighted mixing. A Kullback–Leibler Divergence-based fast model selection procedure is also proposed for learning mixture models in a low dimensional feature space.

Multiclassifier fusion approaches to such difficult problems typically centre around smart feature extraction, input resampling methods, or input space partitioning to exploit modular learning. In this paper, we investigate how partitioning of the output space (i.e. the set of class labels) can be exploited in a multiclassifier fusion framework to simplify such problems and to yield better solutions. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical technique to recursively decompose a C-class problem into C_1 two-(meta) class problems. A generalised modular learning framework is used to partition a set of classes into two disjoint groups called meta-classes. The coupled problems of finding a good partition and of searching for a linear feature extractor that best discriminates the resulting two meta-classes are solved simultaneously at each stage of the recursive algorithm. This results in a binary tree whose leaf nodes represent the original C classes. The proposed hierarchical multiclassifier framework is particularly effective for difficult classification problems involving a moderately large number of classes. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem related to classification of landcover using hyperspectral data: a 12-class AVIRIS subset with 180 bands. For this problem, the classification accuracies obtained were superior to most other techniques developed for hyperspectral classification. Moreover, the class hierarchies that were automatically discovered conformed very well with human domain experts’ opinions, which demonstrates the potential of using such a modular learning approach for discovering domain knowledge automatically from data.', 'corpus_id': 14954871, 'score': 0}]

We propose a natural and simple model for the joint throughput evolution of the set of TCP sessions under such a mix of losses. For the case of Poisson transmission errors, we show that the asymptotic model where the population tends to infinity leads to a well defined and tractable dynamical system. In particular, we get the mean value of the throughput of each session as a function of the transmission error rate and the synchronization rate in the bottleneck router. The large population asymptotic model has two interesting and non-intuitive properties: 1) there exists a positive threshold (given in closed form) on the transmission error rate above which there are no congestion losses at all in steady state; 2) below this threshold, the mean throughput of each flow is an increasing function of the transmission error rate, so that the maximum mean value is in fact achieved when the transmission error rate is equal to this threshold.

A population-sizing equation is derived to ensure that minimum signal-to-noise ratios are favorable to the discrimination of the best building blocks required to solve a problem of bounded deception. In five test problems of varying degrees of nonlinearity, nonuniform scaling, and nondeterminism, the sizing relation proves to be a conservative predictor of average correct convergence. These results suggest how the sizing equation may be viewed as a coarse delineation of a boundary between two distinct types of GA behavior.

In order to obtain consistency of the binary parameters, our new light curves, showing sharp eclipses and a striking reflection effect, were analyzed simultaneously with previously published radial velocity data. The secondary star parameters of M 2 = 0.14 M ?, R 2 = 0.18 R ?, and T 2 = 3084 K are consistent with those of an M6-7 main-sequence star. A credibility issue regarding bolometric corrections is emphasized. More than 250 times of minimum light, including our 41 timings and spanning more than 24 yr, were used for a period study. From a detailed analysis of the O ? C diagram, it emerged that the orbital period of HW Vir has varied as a combination of a downward-opening parabola and two sinusoidal variations, with cycle lengths of P 3 = 15.8 yr and P 4 = 9.1 yr and semiamplitudes of K 3 = 77 s and K 4 = 23 s, respectively. The continuous period decrease with a rate of ?8.28 ? 10?9 days yr?1 may be produced by angular momentum loss due to magnetic stellar wind braking but not by gravitational radiation. Of the possible causes of the cyclical components of the period change, apsidal motion and magnetic period modulation can be ruled out. The most reasonable explanation of both cyclical variations is a pair of light-travel-time effects driven by the presence of two substellar companions with projected masses of M 3sin i 3 = 19.2 M Jup and M 4sin i 4 = 8.5 M Jup. The two objects are the first circumbinary planets known to have been formed in a protoplanetary disk as well the first ones discovered by using the eclipse-timing method. The detection implies that planets could be common around binary stars just as are planets around single stars and demonstrates that planetary systems formed in a circumbinary disk can survive over long timescales.

By analysing the Chandra and XMM-Newton archived data of Abell 3158, we have identified a bow-edge-shaped discontinuity in the X-ray surface brightness distribution about 120 h -1 71 kpc west of the X-ray peak. This feature is found to be associated with a massive, off-centre cool gas clump, and actually forms the west boundary of the cool clump. By calculating the thermal gas pressures in the cool clump and in the free-stream region, we determine that the cool gas clump is moving at a subsonic velocity of 700 +140 -340 km s -1 (M = 0.6 +0.1 -0.3 ) towards west on the sky plane. We exclude the possibility that this cool clump was formed by local inhomogeneous radiative cooling in the intracluster medium, because of the effectiveness of the thermal conduction on the time-scale of ∼.3 Gyr. As no evidence for central active galactic nucleus activity has been found in Abell 3158, and this cool clump bears many similarities to the off-centre cool gas clumps detected in other merging clusters in terms of their mass, size, location and thermal properties (e.g. lower temperature and higher abundance as compared with the environment), we speculate that the cool clump in Abell 3158 was caused by a merger event, and is the remnant of the original central cool-core of the main cluster or the infalling subcluster. This idea is supported not only by the study of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of the cluster member galaxies, but also by the study of the gas entropy-temperature correlation. This example shows that the appearance of such massive, off-centre cool gas clumps can be used to diagnose the dynamical state of a cluster, especially when prominent shocks and cold fronts are absent.', 'corpus_id': 118410675, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '118831918', 'title': 'HOW TO IDENTIFY AND SEPARATE BRIGHT GALAXY CLUSTERS FROM THE LOW-FREQUENCY RADIO SKY', 'abstract': 'In this work, we simulate the 50-200 MHz radio sky that is constrained in the field of view (5 degrees radius) of the 21 Centimeter Array (21CMA), a low-frequency radio interferometric array constructed in the remote area of Xinjiang, China, by carrying out Monte Carlo simulations to model the strong contaminating foreground of the redshifted cosmological reionization signals, including emissions from our Galaxy, galaxy clusters, and extragalactic discrete sources (i.e., star-forming galaxies, radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and radio-loud AGNs). As an improvement over previous works, we consider in detail not only random variations of morphological and spectroscopic parameters within the ranges allowed by multi-band observations, but also the evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters, assuming that relativistic electrons are re-accelerated in the intracluster medium (ICM) in merger events and lose energy via both synchrotron emission and inverse Compton scattering with cosmic microwave background photons. By introducing a new approach designed on the basis of independent component analysis and wavelet detection algorithm, we prove that, with a cumulative observation of one month with the 21CMA array, about 80% of galaxy clusters (37 out of 48 clusters assuming a mean magnetic field of B = 2 mu G in the ICM, or 15 out of 18 clusters assuming B = 0.2 mu G) with central brightness temperatures of > 10 K at 65 MHz can be safely identified and separated from the overwhelmingly bright foreground. By examining the brightness temperature images and spectra extracted from these identified clusters, we find that the morphological and spectroscopic distortions are extremely small compared to the input simulated clusters, and the reduced chi(2) of brightness temperature profiles and spectra are controlled to be less than or similar to 0.5 and less than or similar to 1.3, respectively. These results robustly indicate that in the near future a sample of dozens of bright galaxy clusters will be disentangled from the foreground in 21CMA observations, the study of which will greatly improve our knowledge about cluster merger rates, electron acceleration mechanisms in cluster radio halos, and magnetic field in the ICM.', 'corpus_id': 118831918, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '118515683', 'title': 'CHANDRA OBSERVATION OF A WEAK SHOCK IN THE GALAXY CLUSTER A2556', 'abstract': 'Based on a 21.5 ks Chandra observation of A2556, we identify an edge on the surface brightness profile at about 160 h(71)(-1) kpc northeast of the cluster center, and it corresponds to a shock front whose Mach number M is calculated to be 1.25(-0.03)(+0.02). No prominent substructure, such as sub-cluster, is found in either the optical or X-ray band that can be associated with the edge, suggesting that the conventional supersonic motion mechanism may not work in this case. As an alternative solution, we propose that the nonlinear steepening of an acoustic wave, which is induced by the turbulence of the intracluster medium at the core of the cluster, can be used to explain the origin of the shock front.

A third weak emission component (T-3 approximate to 0.8 keV) is also detected within the innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of interstellar medium of the cD galaxy. Deprojected spectral analysis reveals flat radial temperature distributions for both the hot phase and cool phase components. These results are consistent with the ASCA measurements reported by Xu et al. and resemble the previous findings for the Centaurus Cluster. By analyzing the emission measure ratio and gas metal abundance maps created from the Chandra data, we find that the cool phase component is more metal-enriched than the hot phase one in the 50-100 kpc region, which agrees with that found in M87. The coexistence of the cool phase and hot phase ICM cannot be realized by bubble uplifting from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) alone. Instead, the two-phase ICM properties are better reconciled with a cD corona model. In this model, the cool phase may be ascribed to the plasmas confined in magnetic loops, which are surrounded by the intruding hot phase ICM and have been polluted by metals synthesized in the cD galaxy.

Using the emulator to investigate the cosmology dependence of the c-M relation over the currently allowable range of values, we find—not surprisingly—that σ8 and ω m influence it considerably, but also that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w has a substantial effect. In general, the concentration of lower-mass halos is more sensitive to changes in cosmological parameters as compared to cluster mass halos.

We show that both the structured jet and the uniform jet models can explain the observed properties of GRBs reasonably well. However, if one tries to account for the properties of both XRFs and GRBs in a unified picture, the uniform jet model works reasonably well while the structured jet model fails utterly. The uniform jet model of XRFs and GRBs implies that most GRBs have very small jet opening angles (~ half a degree). This suggests that magnetic fields play a crucial role in GRB jets. The model also implies that the energy radiated in gamma rays is ~100 times smaller than has been thought. Most importantly, the model implies that there are ~10^4 -10^5 more bursts with very small jet opening angles for every such burst we see. Thus the rate of GRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type Ic core collapse supernovae.

A comparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z > 5.5 reveals that the host of GRB 050904 would evade detection and/or confirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectable Lyα emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (A1200 ∼ 1.5 mag).

The planet-based calibration used previously has been replaced by comparing the flux of RCW 38 as measured by ACBAR and BOOMERANG to transfer the WMAP-based BOOMERANG calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical predictions for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated ΛCDM cosmology, including the effects of gravitational lensing. Despite the exponential damping on small angular scales, the primary CMB fluctuations are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 4, up to multipoles of l = 2000. This increase in the precision of the fine-scale CMB power spectrum leads to only a modest decrease in the uncertainties on the parameters of the standard cosmological model. At high angular resolution, secondary anisotropies are predicted to be a significant contribution to the measured anisotropy. A joint analysis of the ACBAR results at 150 GHz and the CBI results at 30 GHz in the multipole range 2000 < l < 3000 shows that the power, reported by CBI in excess of the predicted primary anisotropy, has a frequency spectrum consistent with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and inconsistent with primary CMB.

An authorization mechanism allows different access rights on data items to be selectively assigned to users. Authorization models and mechanisms have been widely investigated in the framework of traditional database systems. The extension of those models and mechanisms to advanced data management systems is quite complex, because those systems are characterized by data models with a larger number of semantic constructs than traditional models, like the relational one. A first authorization model defined for object-oriented (and semantic) database systems has been presented in [20]. In this paper we present an authorization model that substantially extends and revises that model. The most significant extension concerns the support for content-dependent authorization, which was not provided in [20]. Content-dependent authorization is very important in providing an authorization mechanism able to directly support authorization policies of application environments. Moreover, it is a crucial functionality in environments where data objects frequently change their status. In addition, the model presented here differs from the model defined in [20] in that new authorization types are introduced and a finer control of versions is provided.

By contrast, Notch1-deficient hair matrix keratinocytes have lower mitotic rates, resulting in smaller follicles with fewer cells. In addition, the ratio of melanocytes to keratinocytes is greatly reduced in hair follicles. Investigation into the underlying mechanism for these phenotypes revealed significant changes in the Kit, Tgfβ and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways, which have not been previously shown to be downstream of Notch signaling. The level of Kitl (Scf) mRNA produced by Notch1-deficient follicular keratinocytes was reduced when compared with wild type, resulting in a decline in melanocyte population. Tgfβ ligands were elevated in Notch1-deficient keratinocytes, which correlated with elevated expression of several targets, including the diffusible IGF antagonist Igfbp3 in the dermal papilla. Diffusible stromal targets remained elevated in the absence of epithelial Tgfβ receptors, consistent with paracrine Tgfβ signaling. Overexpression of Igf1 in the keratinocyte reversed the phenotype, as expected if Notch1 loss altered the IGF/insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) balance. Conversely, epidermal keratinocytes contained less stromal Igfbp4 and might thus be primed to experience an increase in IGF signaling as animals age.

We find that this result is, although 2 Gyr younger compared with the age of the homogeneous Lambda CDM model, still within 1 sigma agreement with the constraint of cosmic age given by current astronomical measurements.

We have advanced the framework of multiple time scale congestion control and shown its effectiveness at enhancing performance for rate-based feedback control. In this article, we extend the multiple time scale control framework to window-based congestion control, in particular, TCP. This is performed by interfacing TCP with a large time scale module that adjusts the aggressiveness of bandwidth consumpton behavior exhibited by TCP as a function of large time scale network state, that is, information that exceeds the time horizon of the feedback loop as determined by RTT. How to effectively utilize such information—due to its probabilistic nature, dispersion over multiple time scales, and realization on top of existing window-based congestion controls—is a nontrivial problem. First, we define a modular extension of TCP (a function call with a simple interface that applies to various flavors of TCP, e.g., Tahoe, Reno, and Vegas) and show that it significantly improves performance.

In a realistic client/server network the degree to which file sizes are heavy-tailed can directly determine the degree of traffic self-similarity at the link level. This causal relationship is robust relative to changes in network resources, network topology, the influence of cross-traffic, and the distribution of interarrival times. Properties of the transport layer play an important role in preserving and modulating this relationship. The reliable transmission and flow control mechanisms of TCP serve to maintain the long-range dependency structure induced by heavy-tailed file size distributions.

The planet-based calibration used previously has been replaced by comparing the flux of RCW 38 as measured by ACBAR and BOOMERANG to transfer the WMAP-based BOOMERANG calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical predictions for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated ΛCDM cosmology, including the effects of gravitational lensing. Despite the exponential damping on small angular scales, the primary CMB fluctuations are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 4, up to multipoles of l = 2000. This increase in the precision of the fine-scale CMB power spectrum leads to only a modest decrease in the uncertainties on the parameters of the standard cosmological model. At high angular resolution, secondary anisotropies are predicted to be a significant contribution to the measured anisotropy. A joint analysis of the ACBAR results at 150 GHz and the CBI results at 30 GHz in the multipole range 2000 < l < 3000 shows that the power, reported by CBI in excess of the predicted primary anisotropy, has a frequency spectrum consistent with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and inconsistent with primary CMB.

As a result, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third to fifth acoustic peaks as well as the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration uncertainty has been reduced from 6% to 2.1% in temperature through a direct comparison of the CMB anisotropy measured by ACBAR with that of the dipole-calibrated WMAP5 experiment. The measured power spectrum is consistent with a spatially flat, ΛCDM cosmological model. We include the effects of weak lensing in the power spectrum model computations and find that this significantly improves the fits of the models to the combined ACBAR+WMAP5 power spectrum. The preferred strength of the lensing is consistent with theoretical expectations. On fine angular scales, there is weak evidence (1.1σ) for excess power above the level expected from primary anisotropies. We expect any excess power to be dominated by the combination of emission from dusty protogalaxies and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the excess observed by ACBAR is significantly smaller than the excess power at l > 2000 reported by the CBI experiment operating at 30 GHz.

At this regard, we investigate the matter suppression of the MAA effects, performing a linearized stability analysis of the neutrino equations of motion, in the presence of realistic SN density profiles. We compare these results with the numerical solution of the SN neutrino non-linear evolution equations. We find that the large matter term strongly inhibits the MAA effects. In particular, the hindrance becomes stronger including realistic forward- peaked neutrino angular distributions.

If a disc galaxy with an SMBH satisfying the M•-σe relation forms a bar, and the SMBH does not grow in the process, then the increase in σe moves the galaxy off the M•-σe relation. We explore various effects that can affect this result including contamination from the disc and anisotropy. The displacement from the M•-σe relation for individual model barred galaxies correlates with both the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio, M(B)/M(B + D), and the 2D anisotropy, βφ(B + D), both measured within the effective radius of the bulge. Overall, this process leads to an M•-σe for barred galaxies offset from that of unbarred galaxies, as well as an increase in its scatter. We assemble samples of observed unbarred and barred galaxies with classical bulges and find tentative hints of an offset between the two consistent with the predicted.

The inner regions that contain the visible galaxies are stable since early times and are significantly affected only by major mergers. Particles accreted diffusely or in minor mergers are found predominantly in the outskirts of haloes. Our analysis reveals trends that run counter to current perceptions of hierarchical halo assembly. For example, major mergers (i.e. those with progenitor mass ratios greater than 1:10) contribute little to the total mass growth of a halo, on average less than 20 per cent for our six Aquarius haloes. The bulk is contributed roughly equally by minor mergers and by ‘diffuse’ material which is not resolved into individual objects. This is consistent with modelling based on excursion-set theory which suggests that about half of this diffuse material should not be part of a halo of any scale. The simulations themselves suggest that a significant fraction is not truly diffuse, since it was ejected from earlier haloes by mergers prior to their joining the main system. The Aquarius simulations resolve haloes to much lower mass scales than are expected to retain gas or form stars. Thus, the fraction of diffuse dark matter accreted by haloes represents a lower limit to the fraction of diffuse baryons accreted by galaxies. Our results thus confirm that most of the baryons from which visible galaxies form are accreted diffusely, rather than through mergers, and they suggest that only relatively rare major mergers will affect galaxy structure at later times.', 'corpus_id': 102331940, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '14138217', 'title': 'Polarization of Quasars: Resonant Line Scattering in the Broad Absorption Line Region', 'abstract': 'Recent works showed that the absorbing material in broad absorption line (BAL) quasars is optically thick to major resonant absorption lines.

To explain the large polarization degree in the C IV and N V absorption-line troughs detected in a small fraction of BAL QSOs, a nonmonotonic velocity distribution along the line of sight or/and additional contribution from the electron-scattering region is required.

We show that the energy density of the infrared photons inside the torus is much higher than that of the magnetic field in the clouds, and the seed photons of inverse Compton scattering are mainly from the infrared. The maximum energy of the relativistic electrons can reach a Lorentz factor of 105.

The paper introduces a novel remapping strategy for computations whose workload changes can be modeled as a Markov chain. The use of a Markovian model allows us to treat statistical dependence and more complex structure than the usual independent identically distributed random variable assumptions. Our models are quite general and we do not need to impose conditions on the dynamics of the underlying process other than the transition probability matrix. It is shown that optimal remapping can be formulated as a binary decision process: remap or not at a given synchronizing instant. The optimal strategy is then developed for long lasting computations by employing optimal stopping rules in a stochastic control framework. The existence of optimal controls is established. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality are obtained.

It is challenging because of the dynamism nature of DHT networks and time-varying load characteristics. In this paper, we present a hash-based proximity clustering approach for load balancing in heterogeneity DHTs. In the approach, DHT nodes are classified as regular nodes and supernodes according to their computing and networking capacities. Regular nodes are grouped and associated with supernodes via consistent hashing of their physical proximity information on the Internet. The supernodes form a self-organized and churn resilient auxiliary network for load balancing. The hierarchical structure facilitates the design and implementation of a locality-aware randomized load balancing algorithm. The algorithm introduces a factor of randomness in the load balancing processes in a range of neighborhood so as to deal with both the proximity and dynamism. Simulation results show the superiority of the approach, in comparison with a number of other DHT load balancing algorithms.

Unlike UML or E/R diagrams, for example, EITH has compact notation, is unambiguous, and uses a small set of efficient heuristics. We show how EITH is employed in the context of SEEK, using a construction project management example. We also show how EITH can represent various structures in relational databases, and can serve as an efficient representation for E/R diagrams. This suggests that EITH can support efficient matching of more complex, hierarchical structures via indexed tree representations, without compromising the EITH design philosophy or formalism.', 'corpus_id': 12268600, 'score': 0}]"

In this paper, we use a new analysis technique and include 30% more data from the 2001 and 2002 observing seasons than the first release to derive a new set of band-power measurements with significantly smaller uncertainties. The planet-based calibration used previously has been replaced by comparing the flux of RCW 38 as measured by ACBAR and BOOMERANG to transfer the WMAP-based BOOMERANG calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical predictions for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated ΛCDM cosmology, including the effects of gravitational lensing. Despite the exponential damping on small angular scales, the primary CMB fluctuations are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 4, up to multipoles of l = 2000. This increase in the precision of the fine-scale CMB power spectrum leads to only a modest decrease in the uncertainties on the parameters of the standard cosmological model. At high angular resolution, secondary anisotropies are predicted to be a significant contribution to the measured anisotropy. A joint analysis of the ACBAR results at 150 GHz and the CBI results at 30 GHz in the multipole range 2000 < l < 3000 shows that the power, reported by CBI in excess of the predicted primary anisotropy, has a frequency spectrum consistent with the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and inconsistent with primary CMB.

Sources have been extracted from three-dimensional spectral data cubes exploiting a matched filtering technique and then examined interactively to yield global H I parameters. A total of 730 H I detections are cataloged within the solid angle 11h44m 6.5, (2) high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way or its periphery, and (3) signals of lower S/N (to ~4.5) which coincide spatially with an optical object of known similar redshift. Although this region of the sky has been heavily surveyed by previous targeted observations based on optical flux- or size-limited samples, 69% of the extracted sources are newly reported H I detections. The resulting positional accuracy of H I sources is dependent on S/N: it averages 24'' (20'' median) for all sources with S/N > 6.5 and is of order ~17'' (14'' median) for signals with S/N > 12. The median redshift of the sample is ~7000 km s-1, and its distribution reflects the known local large-scale structure including the Virgo Cluster and the void behind it, the A1367-Coma supercluster at cz ~ 7000 km s-1, and a third, more distant overdensity at cz ~ 13,000 km s-1. Distance uncertainties in and around the Virgo Cluster perturb the derived H I mass distribution. Specifically, an apparent deficiency of the lowest H I mass objects can be attributed, at least in part, to the incorrect assignment of some foreground objects to the cluster distance. Several extended H I features are found in the vicinity of the Virgo Cluster. A small percentage (6%) of H I detections have no identifiable optical counterpart, more than half of which are high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way vicinity; the remaining 17 objects do not appear connected to or associated with any known galaxy.

As a result, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third to fifth acoustic peaks as well as the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration uncertainty has been reduced from 6% to 2.1% in temperature through a direct comparison of the CMB anisotropy measured by ACBAR with that of the dipole-calibrated WMAP5 experiment. The measured power spectrum is consistent with a spatially flat, ΛCDM cosmological model. We include the effects of weak lensing in the power spectrum model computations and find that this significantly improves the fits of the models to the combined ACBAR+WMAP5 power spectrum. The preferred strength of the lensing is consistent with theoretical expectations. On fine angular scales, there is weak evidence (1.1σ) for excess power above the level expected from primary anisotropies. We expect any excess power to be dominated by the combination of emission from dusty protogalaxies and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). However, the excess observed by ACBAR is significantly smaller than the excess power at l > 2000 reported by the CBI experiment operating at 30 GHz.

The limitations in this _ __ approach come in part from the transverse and longitudinal wakefields generated in the accelerator structures of the linac. A particularly troublesome problem is the long-range transverse wakefield, -which if not controlled, will produce a large growth in the transverse motion of the bunches. The .currently favored cure for this problem is to detune the dipole mode frequencies of the cells of the structures so the sum of the wakefields generated in each structure decohere (l). Since a two orders of magnitude reduction is required, and the theoretical calculations of the suppression (2) have some uncertainty, it is important that the performance of the structures be verified before they are produced for use in an accelerator. Thus far, measurements of the wakefield suppression have been made on short-length detuned structures at Argonne\'s Advanced Accelerator Test Facility (3). Although the results look promising, this facility currently does not have the measurement precision required for the NLC structures being developed, nor the capability of measuring the wakefields beyond a few ns compared to the few hundred ns needed. In the future, the plan is to do the measurements at SLAC with a dedicated facility called the Accelerator Structure SETup or ASSET (4).

We present a simple prediction scheme, a cosmic emulator, for the concentration-mass (c-M) relation as a function of cosmological parameters for wCDM models. The emulator is constructed from 37 individual models, with three nested N-body gravity-only simulations carried out for each model. The mass range covered by the emulator is 2 × 1012 M ☉ < M < 1015 M ☉ with a corresponding redshift range of z = 0-1. Over this range of mass and redshift, as well as the variation of cosmological parameters studied, the mean halo concentration varies from c ~ 2 to c ~ 8. The distribution of the concentration at fixed mass is Gaussian with a standard deviation of one-third of the mean value, almost independent of cosmology, mass, and redshift over the ranges probed by the simulations. We compare results from the emulator with previously derived heuristic analytic fits for the c-M relation, finding that they underestimate the halo concentration at high masses. Using the emulator to investigate the cosmology dependence of the c-M relation over the currently allowable range of values, we find—not surprisingly—that σ8 and ω m influence it considerably, but also that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w has a substantial effect. In general, the concentration of lower-mass halos is more sensitive to changes in cosmological parameters as compared to cluster mass halos.

When fitting to the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our concentration-mass (c-M) relation differs in normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a function of the peak height parameter, ν. Unlike the c-M relation, the slope of the c-ν relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z = 0-2, while the amplitude varies by ~30% for massive clusters.

This paper addresses the heterogeneity of business process modeling specifications in the area of web services. A new concept called metadata relationships (MR) is introduced to describe the semantic relationship between concepts from two different XML Schemas. This approach is applied for the comparison of concepts from BPML and BPEL4WS, the two major proposals to become a standard in the area of Web Service composition. Metadata relationships are aggregated to discuss the interrelation of these two specifications. The results show that there is a large overlap between the two specifications. Therefore, an integration of them into only one specification seems feasible and desirable. 1. Comparing Business Process Modeling Methods Business Process Modeling (BPM) addresses the domain of logical dependencies of consecutive activities. In this area many different modeling methods have been developed to semantically depict these dependencies in a predefined syntax. The advantages of such formal methods are to be found in the ease of communication, the use of formal analyses, and the implementation in information systems. Business process modeling specifications in the context of Web Services provide functionality like transactions, process execution, choreography of message exchange, or exception handling. These aspects go beyond stateless communication provided by a core Web Services’ architecture built on the Simple Open Acces Protocol (SOAP) [Gu03a], [Gu03b], Web Service Description Language (WSDL) [Ch03], [Gu03c], [Mo03], and Universal Description, Discovery & Integration (UDDI) [Be02]. Such an architecture involves three parties: a service provider, a service broker, and a service requester [TP02]. WSDL is used by a service provider to describe a service which then can be published in an UDDI registry of a service broker. A service requester retrieves the WSDL document via UDDI registry and uses it for binding. Messages are exchanged via SOAP. All these standards are based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) [Br00] allowing an easy transportation on top of common Internet protocols like HTTP. Various specifications have been proposed for BPM of Web Services . The Business Process Execution Language fro Web Services ( BPEL4WS) [An03], the Business Process Modeling Language (BPML) [Ar02a], the Web Service Flow Language (WSFL) [Le01], and XLANG [Th01] are proposals dedicated to the composition of various Web Services to become a business process. The ebXML Business Process Specification Schema (BPSS) [UN01], the Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI) [Ar02b], and the Web Service Conversation Language (WSCL) [Ba02] deal with choreography or conversation, that is the allowed sequence of message exchanges from an external point of view. All of these languages offer an XML-based syntax and they are specially developed to address requirements in the area of WS. Yet, the the expressive power of these specifications are too little investigated with respect to a common benchmark. Van der Aalst et al. use so called workflow and communication patterns and express them with concepts of BPML [Aa02] and BPEL4WS [Wo02]. But in order to better understand these two proposals , transformations are needed that map constructs of their meta model to other better known concepts. The DARPA Agent Markup Language – Services (DAML-S) [DA03] seems to be a natural candicate by developing a extensive ontology on Web Services. This paper complements the efforts of DAML-S by comparing the expressive power of BPML and BPEL4WS activities . Since the merger of WSFL and XLANG to become BPEL4WS they are the two major candidates to gain the status of a standard for Web Service composition. Both of these vocabularies are expressed in XML, permitting the comparison of their metadata, which are elements and attributes defined by their respective XML Schemas [Be01], [BM01]. In section 2 a new approach is introduced called metadata relationships (MR) and schema relationships (SR). This allows for a semi-formal, but in depth analysis of the semantic interrelation of metadata elements from two different schemas. Section 3 discusses metadata relations (MR) between activities supported in BPML and BPEL4WS. The final section outlines future research. 2. Metadata Relationships and Schema Relationships 2.1. Metadata Relationships on the Micro Level The integration of data from different metadata schemas has been discussed since the advent of database systems. Classifications of potential conflicts have been proposed by [CW93] and [SPD92] to name but a few. Generally, a micro and a macro perspective can be distinguished. The micro perspective refers to conflicts due to different representations of concepts in two schemas. The macro perspective allows statements about the relation of entire schemas. We introduce Metadata Relationships (MR) as a concept on the micro level. MR refer to how concepts of a schema A are related to concepts from another schema B. Such concepts are identified by metadata elements of the respective XML Schema or DTD. Accordingly, we define a Metadata-Set MA of a schema A as a set of all elements and attributes that are defined in the XML Schema or DTD of A. A MR(a,b) is formally defined for a ⊆ MA and b ⊆ MB. MR may be of eight different types: the first three are called symmetric MR, the next three are called asymmetric MR, and the last two are called incomplete MR. The symmetric MR are related to cardinalities known from Entity-Relationship Diagrams [Ch76]. But in contrast to ERD cardinalities that refer to relations between entities in one single schema, MR refer to relations between concepts from two different schemas. Symmetric MR describe the situation when a concept a ⊆ MA from one schema A can always be mapped to a concept b ⊆ MB from the other schema B, and when this concept b can also always be mapped to the same concept a of the first schema. From this follows that symmetric MR allow bidirectional transformations. Asymmetric MR permit only one way transformations without loss of information. Incomplete MR refer to concepts that partially intersect or that are not included in the other schema at all. 1. Symmetric MR(1:1) 1:1-MR refer to concepts from different schemas that are semantically equivalent. This MR addresses naming and domain conflicts as describes by Ceri et al. [CW93]. An example would be “Auto” from a German schema G and “Car” from an English schema E. We then write MR(G.Auto, E.Car) = MR(1:1). 2. Symmetric MR(1:N) 1:N-MR address the problem of different levels of abstraction of two concepts. Things may be modeled in terms of data of metadata leading to meta-data conflicts [CW93]. Note, that a MR can only be symmetric when concepts b1, b2,...,bn of the second schema B describe a partition over the concept a of the first schema A. If there is a residue from the intersection of both sets of concepts, no round trip is possible without loss of information. For example, take two different schemas called A and B. A only knows the general concept of “parent”, B distinguished between “mother” and “father”. Then, a “parent” of A can always be mapped to either “mother” or “father” from schema B, and “mother” and “father” can always be mapped to “parent”. The concepts address the same set of instances without residue. A round-trip is possible without loss of information. The actual decision whether a parent is a mother or a father cannot be taken on the level of metadata, it depends on additional information from the data level. We write MR(A.parent, {B.father, B.mother}) = MR(1:N). 3. Symmetric MR(N:M) The N:M-MR is similar to the 1:N-MR, but now both schemas describe a partition of one and the same concept, that is not explicitly modeled in both schemas. An example may be a schema P1 that differentiates between male and female, and another schema P2 distinguishing between minors and adults. Both describe a partition of people. Using additional information from the data level, the metadata concepts can be mapped. We write MR ({P1.male, P1.female}, {P2.minor, P2.adults}) = MR(N:M). 4. Asymmetric MR(1:X) The asymmetric 1:X-MR describes a concept that is a subset of the second concept. On the one hand, this allows for a transformation from the first concept to the second concept without loss of information. On the other hand, a transformation from the second concept to the first one leads to a loss of information, because not all instances can be expressed in terms of the first schema.

The former describes flares with associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while the latter denotes flares without associated CMEs. We find that about 90% of X-class flares are eruptive, but the remaining 10% are confined. To probe why the largest energy releases could be either eruptive or confined, we investigate four X-class events from each of the two types. Both sets of events are selected to have very similar intensities (X1.0 to X3.6) and duration (rise time under 13 minutes and decay time over 9 minutes) in soft X-ray observations, to reduce any bias due to flare size on CME occurrence. We find that the occurrence of eruption (or confinement) is sensitive to the displacement of the location of the energy release, defined as the distance between the flare site and the flux-weighted magnetic center of the source active region. The displacement is 6-17 Mm for confined events but as large as 22-37 Mm for eruptive events. This means that confined events occur closer to the magnetic center, while the eruptive events tend to occur close to the edge of active regions. We use the potential field source-surface model to infer the coronal magnetic field above the source active regions and calculate the flux ratio of low ( 7.1). These results imply that a stronger overlying arcade field may prevent energy releases in the low corona from being eruptive, resulting in flares, but without CMEs.', 'corpus_id': 17010406}	"[{'doc_id': '67817261', 'title': 'Critical Height for the Destabilization of Solar Prominences: Statistical Results from STEREO Observations', 'abstract': 'At which height is a prominence inclined to be unstable, or where is the most probable critical height for the prominence destabilization?

Furthermore, the comparison of the deprojected and projected velocities reveals that most FHCMEs originating within 45° of the Sun-Earth line with a projected speed slower than 900\u2009km\u2009s−1 suffer from large projection effect, while the FHCMEs originating far from the vicinity of solar disk center or moving faster than 900\u2009km s−1have small projection effect.

In this paper, we investigate five coronal eruptions originating from four sigmoidal active regions, using high-cadence, high-resolution narrowband EUV images obtained by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The magnitudes of the flares associated with the eruptions range from GOES class B to class X. Owing to the high-sensitivity and broad temperature coverage of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO, we are able to identify both the contracting and erupting components of the eruptions: the former is observed in cold AIA channels as the contracting coronal loops overlying the elbows of the sigmoid, and the latter is preferentially observed in warm/hot AIA channels as an expanding bubble originating from the center of the sigmoid. The initiation of eruption always precedes the contraction, and in the energetically mild events (B- and C-flares), it also precedes the increase in GOES soft X-ray fluxes. In the more energetic events, the eruption is simultaneous with the impulsive phase of the nonthermal hard X-ray emission. These observations confirm that loop contraction is an integrated process in eruptions with partially opened arcades. The consequence of contraction is a new equilibrium with reduced magnetic energy, as the contracting loops never regain their original positions. The contracting process is a direct consequence of flare energy release, as evidenced by the strong correlation of the maximal contracting speed, and strong anti-correlation of the time delay of contraction relative to expansion, with the peak soft X-ray flux.

Based on our previous work regarding such a joint evolutionary scheme and the consequential black hole-to-bulge mass correlation, we use the X-ray luminosity function of AGN and the cosmological evolution rate, which are from ROSAT X-ray surveys, to estimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black hole growth. By the basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during the luminous AGN phase, the luminosity function of AGNs as a function of redshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the cosmic star formation history of the spheroids. Although the space density of the especially luminous quasars is very low, we show that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black hole growth is almost the same as that of Lyman break galaxies detected by the current optical deep surveys. We thus argue that the optical deep surveys may miss about half of the net star formation in our universe. This is probably due in part to significant dust extinction, as well as the small field of view of previous optical surveys, which cannot sample such rare events with relatively short timescale.

In the present study, we comparatively investigate the proton and electron mean flux variations in the BL, in the interplanetary reconnection exhaust (RE), and across the MC-driven shock by using the Wind data from 1995 to 2006. In general, the proton flux has higher increments at lower energy bands compared with the ambient solar wind. Inside the BL, the core electron flux increases quasi-isotropically and the increments decrease monotonously with energy from similar to 30% (at 18 eV) to similar to 10% (at 70 eV); the suprathermal electron flux usually increases in either parallel or antiparallel direction; the correlation coefficient of electron flux variations in parallel and antiparallel directions changes sharply from similar to 0.8 below 70 eV to similar to 0 above 70 eV. Similar results are also found for RE. However, different phenomena are found across the shock where the electron flux variations first increase and then decrease with a peak increment (>200%) near 100 eV. The correlation coefficient of electron flux variations in parallel and antiparallel directions is always around 0.8. The similar behavior of flux variations in BL and RE suggests that reconnection may commonly occur in BL.

We consider scalar metric fluctuations about a homogeneous and isotropic space-time. Starting from the most general metric, we work out the complete second order action for the perturbations. We then make use of the residual gauge invariance and of the constraint equations to reduce the number of dynamical degrees of freedom. At first glance, it appears that there is an extra scalar metric degree of freedom. However, introducing the Sasaki-Mukhanov variable, the combination of spatial metric fluctuation and matter inhomogeneity for which the action in general relativity has canonical form, we find that this variable has the standard time derivative term in the second order action, and that the extra degree of freedom is nondynamical. The limit lambda -> 1 is well behaved, unlike what is obtained when expanding about Minkowski space-time. Thus, there is no strong coupling problem for Horava-Lifshitz gravity when considering cosmological solutions. We also compute the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. If the potential in the action is taken to be of ""detailed balance"" form, we find a cancellation of the highest derivative terms in the action for the curvature fluctuations. As a consequence, the initial spectrum of perturbations will not be scale-invariant in a general space-time background, in contrast to what happens when considering Horava-Lifshitz matter leaving the gravitational sector unperturbed. However, if we break the detailed balance condition, then the initial spectrum of curvature fluctuations is indeed scale-invariant on ultraviolet scales. As an application, we consider fluctuations in an inflationary background and draw connections with the ""trans-Planckian problem"" for cosmological perturbations. In the special case in which the potential term in the action is of detailed balance form and in which lambda = 1, the equation of motion for cosmological perturbations in the far UV takes the same form as in general relativity.

A typical approach to address scalability is model replication, which starts by creating base models that capture the key entities as model elements and their relationships as model connections. A collection of base models can be adorned with necessary information to characterize a specific scalability concern as it relates to how the base modeling elements are replicated and connected together. In current modeling practice, such model replication is usually accomplished by scaling the base model manually. This is a time-consuming process that represents a source of error, especially when there are deep interactions between model components. As an alternative to the manual process, this paper presents the idea of automated model replication through a model transformation process that expands the number of elements from the base model and makes the correct connections among the generated modeling elements. The paper motivates the need for model replication through case studies taken from models supporting different domains.', 'corpus_id': 14510404, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '37283725', 'title': 'Business Process-Oriented Software Architecture for Supporting Business Process Change', 'abstract': 'As a business process is essential in running an enterprise, this paper aims toward improving software architecture by extracting business-relevant semantics from business logic and transforming them as important elements that need to be molded and represented in software architecture.

The objective of DHT load balancing is to balance the workload of the network nodes in proportion to their capacity so as to eliminate traffic bottleneck. It is challenging because of the dynamism nature of DHT networks and time-varying load characteristics. In this paper, we present a hash-based proximity clustering approach for load balancing in heterogeneity DHTs. In the approach, DHT nodes are classified as regular nodes and supernodes according to their computing and networking capacities. Regular nodes are grouped and associated with supernodes via consistent hashing of their physical proximity information on the Internet. The supernodes form a self-organized and churn resilient auxiliary network for load balancing. The hierarchical structure facilitates the design and implementation of a locality-aware randomized load balancing algorithm. The algorithm introduces a factor of randomness in the load balancing processes in a range of neighborhood so as to deal with both the proximity and dynamism. Simulation results show the superiority of the approach, in comparison with a number of other DHT load balancing algorithms.

A transient astrophysical event observed in both gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) channels would yield rich scientific rewards. A first program initiating EM follow-ups to possible transient GW events has been developed and exercised by the LIGO and Virgo community in association with several partners. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the methods used to promptly identify and localize GW event candidates and to request images of targeted sky locations. Methods. During two observing periods (Dec. 17, 2009 to Jan. 8, 2010 and Sep. 2 to Oct. 20, 2010), a low-latency analysis pipeline was used to identify GW event candidates and to reconstruct maps of possible sky locations. A catalog of nearby galaxies and Milky Way globular clusters was used to select the most promising sky positions to be imaged, and this directional information was delivered to EM observatories with time lags of about thirty minutes. A Monte Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the low-latency GW pipeline's ability to reconstruct source positions correctly. Results. For signals near the detection threshold, our low-latency algorithms often localized simulated GW burst signals to tens of square degrees, while neutron star/neutron star inspirals and neutron star/black hole inspirals were localized to a few hundred square degrees. Localization precision improves for moderately stronger signals.

However, previous work on abstraction refinement was only demonstrated on designs with up to 500 registers. We developed RFN to verify real-world designs that may contain thousands of registers. RFN differs from the previous work in several ways. First, instead of relying on a single engine, RFN employs multiple formal verification engines, including a BDD-ATPG hybrid engine and a conventional BDD-based fixpoint engine, for finding error traces or proving properties on the abstract model. Second, RFN uses a novel two-phase process involving 3-valued simulation and sequential ATPG to determine how to refine the abstract model. Third, RFN avoids the weakness of other abstraction-refinement algorithms-finding error traces on the original design, by utilizing the error trace of the abstract model to guide sequential ATPG to find an error trace on the original design.

Observations have revealed that half of their progenitors, six billion years ago, had peculiar morphologies and/or kinematics, which exclude them from the Hubble sequence. Major mergers, i.e., fusions between galaxies of similar mass, are found to be the likeliest driver for such strong peculiarities. However, thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by such violent collisions, which creates a critical tension between the observed fraction of thin disks and their survival within the ΛCDM paradigm. Here, we show that the observed high occurrence of mergers among their progenitors is only apparent and is resolved when using morpho-kinematic observations that are sensitive to all the phases of the merging process. This provides an original way of narrowing down observational estimates of the galaxy merger rate and leads to a perfect match with predictions by state-of-the-art ΛCDM semi-empirical models with no particular fine-tuning needed. These results imply that half of local thin disks do not survive but are actually rebuilt after a gas-rich major merger occurring in the past nine billion years, i.e., two-thirds of the lifetime of the universe.

FormLink can be used without FeynCalc and FeynCalcFormLink, which is an extension loading FormLink and FeynCalc automatically. With these two packages the impressive speed and other special features of FORM get embedded into the generality of Mathematica and FeynCalc in a simple manner. FeynCalcFormLink provides a FORM-based turbo for FeynCalc, making it much more efficient.

Our approach involves Bayesian model comparison, which takes into account the uncertainties in the paleontological data as well as the distribution of solar orbits consistent with the uncertainties in the astronomical data. We find that various versions of the orbital model are not favored beyond simpler reference models. In particular, the distribution of mass extinction events can be explained just as well by a uniform random distribution as by any other model tested. Although our negative results on the orbital model are robust to changes in the Galaxy model, the Sun's coordinates, and the errors in the data, we also find that it would be very difficult to positively identify the orbital model even if it were the true one.

To investigate the formation and properties of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), we look for their presence in a set of N-body simulations studying the dissipationless merging of multiple star clusters in galactic nuclei. A few tens of star clusters with sizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the Milky Way are accreted on to a pre-existing nuclear stellar component: either a massive super star cluster or a rapidly rotating, compact disc with a scalelength of a few parsecs, mimicking the variety of observed nuclear structures. Images and kinematic maps of the simulation time-steps are then built and analysed as if they were real and at the distance of the Virgo cluster. We use the Scorza–Bender method to search for the presence of disc structures via photometric decomposition. In one case, the merger remnant has all the observed photometric and kinematic properties of NSDs observed in real galaxies. This shows that current observations are consistent with most of the NSD mass being assembled from the migration and accretion of star clusters into the galactic centre. In the other simulation instead, we detect an elongated structure from the unsharp masked image, that does not develop the photometric or kinematic signature of an NSD.

A ""Type I"" spicule with a 3-7-minute lifetime undergoes a cycle of upward and downward motions; by contrast, a ""Type II"" spicule fades away within dozens of seconds without a descending phase. We are motivated by the fact that for a spicule with complicated three-dimensional motion the space-time plot, which is made through a slit on a fixed position, could not match the spicule behavior all the time and might lose its real life story. By revisiting the same data sets, we identify and trace 105 and 102 spicules in the quiet Sun (QS) and coronal hole (CH), respectively, and obtain their statistical dynamic properties.

The first UV spectra taken in 1992 June, simultaneously with ROSAT, show strong absorption lines of N\xa0v, C\xa0iv and Si\xa0iv, extending over a velocity range from −1000 to −5000\xa0km\xa0s−1 with respect to the corresponding line centre. Our analysis shows that the broad emission-line region (BELR) is, at least partially, covered by the material causing these absorption lines. In the IUE spectrum taken in 1995 January, the continuum was a factor of 2 brighter and the UV absorption lines are found to be considerably weaker than in 1992, but little variation in the emission-line fluxes is found. With UV spectral indices of αUV≃1.82 and 1.46 for the 1992 and 1995 data, the far-UV spectrum is steep.

This paper examines the ionization status and geometry of the X-ray absorber by combining the properties of the UV lines with the X-ray continuum absorption. We show that the gas has to have large column densities in ions of major UV absorption lines, such as C IV, N V, O VI, and Ne VIII, in order to have sufficient opacity around 0.2-0.35 keV. The UV absorption lines have to be saturated if the X-ray absorber intersects the line of sight to the UV continuum emission region. A uniformly covering UV and X-ray absorption model can be constructed for PG 1411+442, but in some other soft X-ray-detected BAL QSOs, such as PG 1001+054, the observed line optical depth is much lower than expected from the X-ray-absorbing material. We propose a scheme in which a substantial fraction of the line of sight to the continuum source may be covered by either an optically thick flow or clouds in a narrow velocity range, but in which the total covering factor of either the whole flow or all clouds is close to unity. The absorber can contribute significantly to the extremely highly ionized emission lines, such as O VI λλ1032/1037 and Ne VIII λλ770/780, if it covers a substantial fraction of solid angle and if the density is higher than 108 cm-3. However, it has very little impact on the medium- and low-ionization UV lines such as N V and C IV. The profiles of Ne VIII and O VI lines may be indicators for the kinematics of the X-ray absorber in QSOs. The observed Ne VIII line profiles in QSOs suggest that the velocity of the gas projected onto our line of sight is similar to that seen in the outflows of the UV BALs.', 'corpus_id': 1458695, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '17167816', 'title': 'Two-Current-Sheet Reconnection Model of Interdependent Flare and Coronal Mass Ejection', 'abstract': 'Time-dependent resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations are carried out to study a flux rope eruption caused by magnetic reconnection with implication in coexistent flare-CME (coronal mass ejection) events.

High-resolution X-ray observations in the imaging and spectral domain have recently opened a new window on active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback onto the circumnuclear gas. Spectral diagnostics, as well as the remarkable morphological coincidence between [O iii] and X-rays, point to AGN photoionisation as the dominant ionisation mechanism on scales as large as a few kpc. Aims. In this paper we extend these studies to the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1365, known to host a circumnuclear ring of intense star formation at � 1.3 kpc from the nucleus. The main scope of this investigation is to study the connection between nuclear activity and star formation in nearby AGN. Methods. We present a deep (� 5.8 days) 0.3–2 keV high-resolution spectrum of NGC 1365, collected with the reflection grating spectrometer (RGS) on board XMM-Newton. Results. The spectrum is dominated by strong recombination lines of He- and H-like transitions from carbon to silicon, as well as by L transitions from Fexvii. The continuum is strong, especially in the 10 to 20 A range. Formal fits require two optically thin, collisionally ionised plasma components, with temperatures � 300 and � 640 eV. However, they leave the bulk of the forbidden components of the He-α Ovii and Nvi triplets unaccounted for. These features can be explained as being produced by photoionised gas. NGC 1365 is therefore the first obscured AGN, whose high-resolution X-ray spectrum requires both collisional ionisation and photoionisation. Conclusions. The relative weakness of photoionisation does not stem from the intrinsic weakness of its AGN, whose X-ray luminosity is ∼ >10 42 erg s −1 . We suggest that it may instead come from the line-of-sight from the active nucleus to the NLR being blocked by optically thick matter in the broad line region, at the same time responsible for the large observed variation of the column density obscuring the X-ray active nucleus.

New instructions have been proposed recently to accelerate bit permutations in general-purpose processors, reducing the instructions needed to achieve an arbitrary n-bit permutation from O(n) to O(log(n)).

PLX is unique in that it is designed from scratch as a fully subword-parallel architecture with novel features like datapath scalability from 32-bit to 128-bit words, and a new definition of predication for reducing conditional branches. We illustrate the use of PLX's architectural features with four frequently used multimedia kernels: discrete cosine transform, pixel padding, clip test and median filter. Our performance results show that a 64-bit PLX implementation achieves significant speedups compared to a basic 64-bit RISC processor and to IA-32 processors with MMX and SSE multimedia extensions.

This allows us to estimate the electron density (∼ 4,700–9,400 cm −3 ) and extinction (AV ∼ 16–20 mag) of the shell, including detailed two-dimensional distribution of the properties in the brightest clump, as well as the discovery of a faint high-velocity (∼ –440 km s −1 ) component in the clump. Our SNR shock model calculations estimate the preshock number density of ∼ 250–500 cm −3 and shock speed of ∼ 80–250 km s −1 in the [Fe II]-emitting region of the SNR. The comparison between the observed and modelled radial profiles of the line intensities and their ratios reveals that the shell is composed of multiple thin filaments which have been likely formed in episodic mass loss processes of a progenitor star.

These spectral data are placed in context using ground-based optical emission-line images of the region and a far-UV image obtained by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT).

An extended knot of emission located in the NW part of the shell appears to be aligned with the pulsar's X-ray jet, suggesting a possible interaction with the shell material. Surprisingly, the IR spectrum of the knot resembles the spectrum of freshly formed dust in Cas A, and is dominated by an unidentified dust emission feature at 21 μm. The spectra of the shell also contain various emission lines and show that some are significantly broadened, suggesting that they originate in rapidly expanding supernova (SN) ejecta. We present the first evidence that the PWN is driving shocks into expanding SN ejecta and we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of the IR emission in which the shell is composed entirely of SN ejecta.

In our analysis we place particular emphasis on constraints placed on the dynamical evolution by the chemistry. The most important result of this study is to stress the importance of shielding the moleculargas from the destructive effects of UVradiation. For shock ram pressures comparable to or exceeding typical local interstellar medium pressures, self-shielding controls the formation time of molecular hydrogen, but CO formation requires shielding of the interstellar radiation field by dust grains. We find that for typical parameters the molecular hydrogen fractional abundance can become significant well before CO forms. The timescale for (CO) molecular cloud formation is not set by the H2 formation rate on grains, but rather by the timescale for accumulating a sufficient column density or extinction, AV k0:7. The local ratio of atomic to molecular gas (4:1), coupled with short estimates for the lifetimes of molecular clouds (3‐5 Myr), suggests that the timescales for accumulating molecular clouds from atomic material typically must be no longer than about 12‐20 Myr. Based on the shielding requirement, this implies that the typical product of preshock density and velocity must benvk20 cm � 3 km s � 1 .

We compare our results with the soft X-ray background (SXRB) emission detected in front of 378 identified shadowing regions during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. This foreground component is principally attributed to the hot gas of the so-called Local Bubble (LB), an irregularly shaped cavity of ~50-150 pc around the Sun, which is supposed to contain ~106 K plasma. Our results suggest that the SWCX emission from the heliosphere is bright enough to account for most of the foreground emission toward the majority of low galactic latitude directions, where the LB is the least extended. On the other hand, in a large part of directions with galactic latitude above 30°, the heliospheric SWCX intensity is significantly smaller than the measured one. However, the SWCX R2/R1 band ratio differs slightly from the data in the galactic center direction, and more significantly in the galactic anticentre direction where the observed ratio is the smallest. Assuming that both SWCX and hot gas emission are present and their relative contributions vary with direction, we tested a series of thermal plasma spectra for temperatures ranging from 10 5 to 10 6.5 K and searched for a combination of SWCX spectra and thermal emission matching the observed intensities and band ratios, while simultaneously being compatible with O VI emission measurements. In the frame of collisional equilibrium models and for solar abundances, the range we derive for hot gas temperature and emission measure cannot reproduce the Wisconsin C/B band ratio.

Skew quadrupoles are adopted for the global coupling compensation. The coupling compensation scheme and the method to tune and measure the x-y coupling at the interaction point will be introduced in detail. COUPLING COMPENSATION SCHEME The BESIII detector solenoid has maximum field strength of 1.0T over an effective length of ±1.8m around the interaction point (IP) where the particle motion between the horizontal and vertical planes will be coupled. The lattice functions, the vertical emmittance and the tilt angle of beam are strongly related to the coupling parameters. Therefore, without the dedicated coupling compensation it is impossible to meet higher luminosity. According to the requirements of high energy physics, BEPCII will be operated at the energy range from 1.0GeV to 2.1GeV, so the compensation system should be powerful enough to work perfectly for particles within the momentum range. For this purpose an anti-solenoid system has been designed in the superconducting magnet package to realize the local compensation of x-y coupling effects in the interaction region (IR). This system consists of three anti-solenoids AS1, AS2 and AS3 and a skew quadrupole inside the superconducting cryostat. AS1 locates between the IP and the superconducting quadrupole (SCQ) which acts as the first vertical focusing quadrupole. AS2 and the skew quadrupole overlap SCQ, while AS3 locates after SCQ. They are all dedicated to the compensation of the detector fields along the beam line for both e+ and erings which have the same beam energy. The local compensation layout of BEPCII and wiring schematic diagram are shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1: The local coupling compensation layout of BEPCII and wiring schematic diagram. With this compensation scheme, the integral field ∫Bzds between the IP and SCQ is zero. The longitudinal field over SCQ is nearly zero and the integral field ∫Bzds between SCQ and the first horizontal focusing quadrupole is zero too. As well known the compensation of longitudinal field within SCQ region is a key for higher luminosity. The skew quadrupole which overlaps SCQ can make fine tuning of longitudinal field over the SCQ region instead of the mechanical rotation method. AS2 and AS3, which have their own independent trim circuits to allow fine tuning of the anti-solenoid compensation scheme, are in series with AS1. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the axial combination magnetic field Bz along the axis of BESIII detector after compensation simulated by OPERA-2D code. Figure 2: The distribution of the axial combination magnetic field along the axis of the BESIII detector. Since the anti-solenoids AS1, AS2, AS3 and the skew quadrupole are the common elements for both e+ and erings, it is necessary to add some independent variables for the coupling adjustment of one ring with the coupling of the other ring unchanged. Due to the limitation of free space, we arrange four skew quadrupoles only for each ring, which are distributed in the interaction region, injection regions and RF region respectively for the further fine tuning of coupling. The horizontal dispersion in those regions is free so that the changes of the vertical dispersion and its slope can be neglected during the coupling adjustment. The global coupling parameter and the beam tile angle at the IP of each ring, which are induced by solenoid field, the beam vertical orbit distortion inside the sextupoles and the parasitic x-y coupling due to machine errors, can be compensated by tuning the strength of the skew quadrupoles and antisolenoids. ________________________________________ *Email: yuch@mail.ihep.ac.cn Proceedings of EPAC 2004, Lucerne, Switzerland', 'corpus_id': 201630181, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '123281398', 'title': 'Transfer matrix of linear solenoid fringe superimposed magnet', 'abstract': 'The general transfer matrix of the superimposed solenoid magnet linear fringe field is given in this paper.

Contemporary ccNUMA systems, such as the SGI Altix, have a large number of nodes, where each node consists of a small number of processors and a fixed amount of physical memory. All processors in the system access the same global virtual address space but the physical memory is distributed across nodes, and coherence is maintained using hardware mechanisms. Accesses to local physical memory (on the same node as the requesting processor) results in lower latencies than accesses to remote memory (on a different node). Since many scientific programs are memory-bound, an intelligent page-placement policy that allocates pages closer to the requesting processor can significantly reduce number of cycles required to access memory. We show that such a policy can lead to significant savings in wall-clock execution time.In this paper, we introduce a novel hardware-assisted page placement scheme based on automated profiling. The placement scheme allocates pages near processors that most frequently access that page. The scheme leverages performance monitoring capabilities of contemporary microprocessors to efficiently extract an approximate trace of memory accesses. This information is used to decide page affinity, i.e., the node to which the page is bound. Our method operates entirely in user space, is widely automated, and handles not only static but also dynamic memory allocation.We evaluate our framework with a set of multi-threaded benchmarks from the NAS and SPEC OpenMP suites. We investigate the use of two different hardware profile sources with respect to the cost (e.g., time to trace, number of records in profile) vs. the accuracy of the profile and the corresponding savings in wall-clock execution time. We show that long-latency loads provide a better indicator for page placement than TLB misses.Our experiments show that our method can efficiently improve page placement, leading to an average wall-clock execution time saving of more than 20% for our benchmarks, with a one-time profiling overhead of 2.7% over the overall original program wallclock time.

The conference has matured to one of the top high-quality academic venues on embedded systems with a competitive acceptance rate of 23% in 2003. The conference attracts papers on topics ranging from hardware enhancements of embedded architectures over compilation, system development, and analysis tools to modeling of embedded systems. The four papers presented in this issue are extensions of the authors’ conference contributions. The first paper, Dynamic Coalescing for 16-bit Instructions by Arvind Krishnaswamy and Rajiv Gupta, proposes a minor architectural extension to the ARM processor architecture to allow the native 32-bit ARM instructions to be interspersed with the smaller 16-bit Thumb instructions supported by the processor. The authors use compilation techniques to fold two Thumb instruction into a single equivalent ARM instruction, thereby reducing the number of cycles required for execution. They demonstrate that their technique can result both in performance improvements and potentially reduced energy consumption. The second paper, The Implementation and Evaluation of Dynamic Code Decompression using DISE by Marc L. Corliss, E. Christopher Lewis, and Amir Roth, promotes code compression techniques combined with programmable hardware support for postfetch time decompression using their so-called dynamic instruction stream editing (DISE) technique. Special instructions in the application code can reprogram the DISE engine by specifying patterns and parameters for patterns. Once programmed, instruction fetches consisting of compressed code are expanded upon a match. Benefits of this technique are in a significant reduction in code size, improved performance and, to some extend, lower energy consumption. The third paper, Memory Safety Without Runtime Checks or Garbage Collection by Dinakar Dhurajti, Sumant Kowshik, Vikram Adve, and Chris Lattner, describes a set of methods to ensure memory safety without requiring run-time support or user annotations. The idea is to restrict the C language such that a combination of compilation techniques and type-sensitive pool-based memory allocation ensures safe program execution. As a result, array bound checks and null pointer checks can also be removed without risking to violate program semantics. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability of these techniques to a number of C benchmarks.

The Helioseismic Magnetic Imager has been providing unprecedented full-disk vector magnetograms covering the rising phase of the solar cycle 24. In this study, we analyze 18 flares in four active regions, with GOES X-ray class ranging from C4.7 to X5.4. We find that there are permanent and rapid changes of magnetic field around the flaring PIL, the most notable of which is the increase of the transverse magnetic field. The changes of fields integrated over the area and the derived change of Lorentz force both show a strong correlation with flare magnitude. It is the first time that such magnetic field changes have been observed even for C-class flares.

While the metastability of the Universe constrains the possible enhancement in the Higgs to diphoton decay width in the light stau scenario, an increase of the order of 50% can be achieved in the region of large tan β. Larger enhancements may be obtained, but would require values of tan β associated with non-perturbative values of the tau Yukawa coupling at scales below the GUT scale, thereby implying the presence of new physics beyond the MSSM.', 'corpus_id': 118481994}	[{'doc_id': '118394634', 'title': 'Light Dark Matter and the Electroweak Phase Transition in the NMSSM', 'abstract': 'We analyze the stability of the vacuum and the electroweak phase transition in the NMSSM close to the Peccei-Quinn symmetry limit.

PACS numbers: 04.30.Db, 04.25.Dm, 04.70.Bw, 97.80.Fk An international network of interferometric gravitational wave (GW) observatories (the LIGO project in the U.S., the VIRGO and GEO projects in Europe, and the TAMA project in Japan [1]) will be capable of detecting gravitational waves in the next few years. This could have revolutionary implications for astronomy since it constitutes a new form of “light” with which to observe the Universe, a form that is better correlated with the bulk motions of matter and is very hard to shield or distort. Gravitational waves were originally predicted by Einstein in 1915 but their theoretical existence was not completely understood until the 1960’s [2] and their direct experimental detection has remained a daunting challenge [3]. One of the most promising sources for detection is the collision of two black holes to form a single, final hole. Such a collision is expected to be the end point of the decaying inspiral for a binary pair of holes. Just how promising such collisions are depends very much on the masses of the colliding holes and is connected with the characteristics of detectors. The sensitivity of the laser interferometric detectors, like LIGO, peaks around 100 Hz. The major determinant of the frequency of GWs produced in a black hole inspiral/collision is M, the mass of the system (and of the final black hole formed). The frequency scales as 1M and is around 10 4 Hz for a 1MO system. The usual black hole candidates are stellar mass holes and supermassive holes (10 6 MO) in the centers of many galaxies. The frequency of GWs from the former candidates would be too high except for the weak radiation from the early inspiral. GWs from supermassive holes would be too low in frequency for Earth based systems but well suited to space based detection. Black holes of 100MO would be ideal as sources and black holes of any mass can in principle exist. But the astrophysical motivation for such “middleweight” holes was weak. Recent observations [4] of x-ray emission from galaxies suggest that some galaxies may contain middleweight holes, perhaps as an evolutionary stage in the formation of supermassive holes. Should such a middleweight hole exist it will produce GWs near the optimal 100 Hz frequency when it collides with compact objects of equal or smaller masses. For two different reasons, we focus here on the collision of roughly equal mass holes. The first is that the power radiated from the collision of holes of masses m1 # m2 scales as m1m2 2 , at least in the case that m1', 'corpus_id': 119082195, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '447730', 'title': 'eta meson photoproduction on hydrogen near threshold.', 'abstract': 'The total cross section for {gamma}{ital p}{r_arrow}{eta}{ital p} near threshold has been measured using the PHOENICS tagging system at the ELSA electron facility of the Physikalisches Institut der Universitaet Bonn.

The physics at CDF includes precise measurements of the masses of the top quark and W boson, measurement of CP violation and Bs mixing, and searches for Higgs bosons and new physics signatures, all of which require heavy flavor tagging with large charged particle tracking acceptance.

Knowledge may be uncertain; thus one has to work with beliefs.

The arithmetical completeness theorem is proved saying that a formula A of DPL is provable in DPL iff for each arithmetical interpretationf,f(A) is provable in PA. Various modifications of this result are considered. Introduction. The aim of the present paper is to apply techniques of arithmetical interpretations (or: provability interpretations) of modal propositional logic (as developed and studied by deJongh, Sambin, Solovay, Smoryn\'ski, Guaspari and others, see [12], [1 1], [10]) to dynamic logic. Dynamic logic (or: logic of programs) is a generalization of modal logic extensively studied in computer science (Pratt, Fischer, Ladner, Segerbergh, Parikh, see [9], [4], [8]). Both various systems of modal logic and systems of dynamic logic have well-behaving Kripke semantics (necessity means validity in all alternative states-worlds) and complete axiomatizations (for modal logic see [6] and [12], for dynamic logic see [8]). The idea behind arithmetical interpretations of modal logic is to interpret necessity as formal provability (in arithmetic). Now, dynamic logic is a modal logic with many modalities of necessity (corresponding to programs) so that the question arises whether one could interpret these modalities by formal provability in various theories (and obtain some completeness results). This question will be answered positively. What is the meaning of our results? First, the question just formulated seems to be a very natural question and it seems not to be trivial to answer it. Second, our result could elucidate from an unexpected point of view the saying of Kowalski [5]: ""algorithm logic + control"". We shall see that programs (algorithms)i.e. their logical components-may be modelled by some formal theories. Third, it has proved to be useful to investigate modal calculi having various modalities, not just the necessity, when studying self-reference in Peano arithmetic ((see [10], [11]). And we have in dynamic logic an example of such a calculus having both Received October 15, 1981. ? 1983, Association for Symbolic Logic 0022-4812/83/4803-0021 /$02.00', 'corpus_id': 46561034, 'score': 0}]"

The investigation of the longitudinal charge distribution in the electron bunches on a bunch-by-bunch basis is an important issue for optimizing the bunch compression and improving the performance of the machine. This paper introduces a new tool for longitudinal diagnostics based on THz spectroscopy of coherent radiation. A novel spectrometer has been designed which permits to analyze the radiation of single electron bunches in a broad spectral range and with high resolution. Preliminary measurements with this spectrometer are presented. A strong variation of the CTR intensity in the 40 μm regime is observed when the off-crest phase in the accelerating cavities preceding the first magnetic bunch compressor is changed in small steps. This variation in the CTR intensity is found to be correlated with a similar variation in the pulse energy of the FEL light.

HATSouth achieves this by monitoring extended areas on the sky, deriving high precision light curves for a large number of stars, searching for the signature of planetary transits, and confirming planetary candidates with larger telescopes. HATSouth employs six telescope units spread over three prime locations with large longitude separation in the southern hemisphere (Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; HESS site, Namibia; Siding Spring Observatory, Australia). Each of the HATSouth units holds four 0.18 m diameter f/2.8 focal ratio telescope tubes on a common mount producing an 8.2° × 8.2° field of view on the sky, imaged using four 4 K × 4 K CCD cameras and Sloan r filters, to give a pixel scale of 3.7'' pixel-1.

This approach can automatically discover the hidden semantic sequences in the documents under each category. Based on n-multigram language models and n-gram language models, we put forward two text classification algorithms. The experiments on RCV1 show that our proposed algorithm based on n-multigram models alone can achieve the similar or even better classification performance compared with the classifier based on n-gram models but the model size of our algorithm is much smaller than that of the latter. Another proposed algorithm based on the combination of n-multigram models and n-gram models improves the micro-F1 and macro-F1 values from 89.5% to 92.6% and 87.2% to 91.1% respectively.

The Standard Model of particle physics describes the basic structure of matter and forces, to the extent we have been able to probe thus far. However, it leaves some big questions unanswered. Some are within the Standard Model itself, such as why there are so many fundamental particles and why they have different masses. In other cases, the Standard Model simply fails to explain some phenomena, such as the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, the existence of dark matter and dark energy, and the mechanism that reconciles gravity with quantum mechanics. These gaps lead us to conclude that the universe must contain new and unexplored elements of Nature. Most of particle and nuclear physics is directed towards discovering and understanding these new laws of physics. These questions are best pursued with a variety of approaches, rather than with a single experiment or technique. Particle physics uses three basic approaches, often characterized as exploration along the cosmic, energy, and intensity frontiers. Each employs different tools and techniques, but they ultimately address the same fundamental questions. This allows a multi-pronged approach where attacking basic questions from different angles furthers knowledge and providesmore\xa0» deeper answers, so that the whole is more than a sum of the parts. A coherent picture or underlying theoretical model can more easily emerge, to be proven correct or not. The intensity frontier explores fundamental physics with intense sources and ultra-sensitive, sometimes massive detectors. It encompasses searches for extremely rare processes and for tiny deviations from Standard Model expectations. Intensity frontier experiments use precision measurements to probe quantum effects. They typically investigate very large energy scales, even higher than the kinematic reach of high energy particle accelerators. The science addresses basic questions, such as: Are there new sources of CP violation? Is there CP violation in the leptonic sector? Are neutrinos their own antiparticles? Do the forces unify? Is there a weakly coupled hidden sector that is related to dark matter? Do new symmetries exist at very high energy scales? To identify the most compelling science opportunities in this area, the workshop Fundamental Physics at the Intensity Frontier was held in December 2011, sponsored by the Office of High Energy Physics in the US Department of Energy Office of Science. Participants investigated the most promising experiments to exploit these opportunities and described the knowledge that can be gained from such a program. The workshop generated much interest in the community, as witnessed by the large and energetic participation by a broad spectrum of scientists. This document chronicles the activities of the workshop, with contributions by more than 450 authors. The workshop organized the intensity frontier science program along six topics that formed the basis for working groups: experiments that probe (i) heavy quarks, (ii) charged leptons, (iii) neutrinos, (iv) proton decay, (v) light, weakly interacting particles, and (vi) nucleons, nuclei, and atoms. The conveners for each working group included an experimenter and a theorist working in the field and an observer from the community at large. The working groups began their efforts well in advance of the workshop, holding regular meetings and soliciting written contributions. Specific avenues of exploration were identified by each working group. Experiments that study rare strange, charm, and bottom meson decays provide a broad program of measurements that are sensitive to new interactions. Charged leptons, particularly muons and taus, provide a precise probe for new physics because the Standard Model predictions for their properties are very accurate. Research at the intensity frontier can reveal CP violation in the lepton sector, and elucidate whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles. A very weakly coupled hidden-sector that may comprise the dark matter in the universe could be discovered. The search for proton decay can probe the unification of the forces with unprecedented reach and test sacrosanct symmetries to very high scales. Detecting an electric dipole moment for the neutron, or neutral atoms, could establish a clear signal for new physics, while limits on such a measurement would place severe constraints on many new theories. This workshop marked the first instance where discussion of these diverse programs was held under one roof. As a result, it was realized that this broad effort has many connections; a large degree of synergy exists between the different areas and they address similar questions. Results from one area were found to be pertinent to experiments in another domain.«\xa0less', 'corpus_id': 119282846, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '59366071', 'title': 'Determination of Strange Sea Quark Distributions from Fixed-target and Collider Data', 'abstract': 'We present an improved determination of the strange sea distribution in the nucleon with constraints coming from the recent charm production data in neutrino-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering by the NOMAD and CHORUS experiments and from charged current inclusive deep-inelastic scattering at HERA.

This framework allows the source server to incrementally build a topology graph that contains the network connections not only from the server to each subscriber, but also among the subscribers themselves. With such a topology graph in place, we consider efficient overlay multicast for scalable OSN services. We first show that idling nodes, which do not receive video data for their own playback, can actually be used for data forwarding to significantly reduce the cost of overlay multicast. In light of this observation, we then propose a novel overlay multicast technique that distinguishes itself from existing schemes with these three aspects. First, the proposed technique is centered on the topology graph and can take advantage of the actual network connections among the subscribing nodes. Second, the new scheme is able to find and incorporate appropriate idling nodes in multicast to reduce network traffic. Third, with our approach, a node can be used in multiple multicast trees for data forwarding to improve the overall system performance.

While literature reported better performance from pairwise coupling than one-vs-others, the number of base learners required by pairwise coupling is quadratic in K. Alternatively, error correcting output codes (ECOC) provides a more general framework for designing polychotomizers. It associates each class with a codeword, which provides the capability to unify the traditional schemes. However, the design of an effective ""coding matrix"" remains an open problem. We study one kind of ECOC polychotomizer that decodes using minimum hamming distance. We propose a novel data-driven way to design the codewords based on inter-cluster distance.

Latent friends are defined in this paper as people who share the similar topic distribution in their blogs. These people may not actually know each other, but they have the interest and potential to find each other out. Three approaches are designed for latent friend detection. The first one, called cosine similarity-based method, determines the similarity between bloggers by calculating the cosine similarity between the contents of the blogs. The second approach, known as topic-based method, is based on the discovery of latent topics using a latent topic model and then calculating the similarity at the topic level. The third one is two-level similarity-based, which is conducted in two stages. In the first stage, an existing topic hierarchy is exploited to build a topic distribution for a blogger. Then, in the second stage, a detailed similarity comparison is conducted for bloggers that are close in interest to each other which are discovered in the first stage.

All these co-occurrence relations can be exploited to alleviate data sparseness or to represent objects more meaningfully.

The clickthrough data is highly sparse and contains different types of objects (user, query and Web page), and the relationships among these objects are also very complicated. By performing analysis on these data, we attempt to discover Web users' interests and the patterns that users locate information. In this paper, a novel approach CubeSVD is proposed to improve Web search. The clickthrough data is represented by a 3-order tensor, on which we perform 3-mode analysis using the higher-order singular value decomposition technique to automatically capture the latent factors that govern the relations among these multi-type objects: users, queries and Web pages. A tensor reconstructed based on the CubeSVD analysis reflects both the observed interactions among these objects and the implicit associations among them. Therefore, Web search activities can be carried out based on CubeSVD analysis.

These allow us to make self-consistent predictions for the orientation dependence of both color evolution and spectral features. We compare models with different degrees of asphericity and metallicity and find significant observable consequences of both. In aspherical models, we find spectral and light curve features that vary systematically with observer orientation. In particular, we find that the early-phase light curves are brighter and bluer when viewed close to the polar axis but that the peak flux is highest for equatorial (off-axis) inclinations. Spectral line features also depend systematically on observer orientation, including the velocity of the Si II 6355 A line. Consequently, our models predict a correlation between line velocity and color that could assist the identification of supernovae associated with off-axis jet-driven explosions.

Most conventional approaches classify the motion recognition task into partial feature extraction and time-domain recognition subtasks. However, the information of motion resides in the space-time domain instead of the time domain or space domain independently, implying that fusing the feature extraction and classification in the space and time domains into a single framework is preferred. Based on this notion, this work presents a novel Space-Time Delay Neural Network (STDNN) capable of handling the space-time dynamic information for motion recognition. The STDNN is unified structure, in which the low-level spatiotemporal feature extraction and high-level space-time-domain recognition are fused. The proposed network possesses the spatiotemporal shift-invariant recognition ability that is inherited from the time delay neural network (TDNN) and space displacement neural network (SDNN), where TDNN and SDNN are good at temporal and spatial shift-invariant recognition, respectively. In contrast to multilayer perceptron (MLP), TDNN, and SDNN, STDNN is constructed by vector-type nodes and matrix-type links such that the spatiotemporal information can be accurately represented in a neural network.

The moving Arabic numerals (MAN) experiment simulates the object's free movement in the space-time domain on image sequences. According to these results, STDNN possesses a good generalization ability with respect to the spatiotemporal shift-invariant recognition.

The supporting patterns are then used by the fuzzy perceptron to tune the hyperplane that can cause correct recognition, and also tune the hyperplane that resulted in wrong recognition. Since only two hyperplane need to be tuned for a recognition error, the proposed adaptation scheme is time-economic and suitable for on-line adaptation. Although the adaptation scheme cannot ensure to correct the wrong recognition right after adaptation, the hyperplanes are tuned in the direction for correct recognition iteratively and the speed of adaptation can be adjusted by a ""belief"" parameter set by the user.

We report on the results of new simulations of near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) counterpart associated with the super-massive black hole at the Galactic Center. Aims. Our goal is to investigate and understand the physical processes behind the variability associated with the NIR flaring emission from Sgr A * . Methods. The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics (AO) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and CIAO NIR camera on the Subaru telescope (13 june 2004; 30 july 2005; 1 june 2006; 15 may 2007; 17 may 2007 and 28 may 2008). We used a model of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the inner parts of an accretion disk. The relativistic simulations have been carried out using the Karas-Yaqoob (KY) ray-tracing code. Results. We probe the existence of a correlation between the modulations of the observed flux density light curves and changes in polarimetric data. Furthermore, we confirm that the same correlation is also predicted by the hot spot model. Correlations between intensity and polarimetric parameters of the observed light curves as well as a comparison of predicted and observed light curve features through a pattern recognition algorithm result in the detection of a signature of orbiting matter under the influence of strong gravity. This pattern is detected statistically significant against randomly polarized red noise. Expected results from future observations of VLT interferometry like GRAVITY experiment are also discussed. Conclusions. The observed correlations between flux modulations and changes in linear polarization degree and angle can be a sign that the NIR flares have properties that are not expected from purely random red-noise. We find that the geometric shape of the emission region plays a major role in the predictions of the model. From fully relativistic simulations of a spiral shape emitting region, we conclude that the observed swings of the polarization angle during NIR flares support the idea of compact orbiting spots instead of extended patterns. The effects of gravitational shearing, fast synchrotron cooling of the components and confusion from a variable accretion disk have been taken into account. Simulated centroids of NIR images lead us to the conclusion that a clear observation of the position wander of the center of NIR images with future infrared interferometers will prove the existence of orbiting hot spots in the vicinity of our Galactic super-massive black hole."", 'corpus_id': 118354810, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '119187209', 'title': 'Off-equatorial orbits in strong gravitational fields near compact objects', 'abstract': ""Near a black hole or an ultracompact star, the motion of particles is governed by a strong gravitational field.

The following criteria were used: location within 3\' of η Car, an appropriate V and B - V combination, and proper motion (where available). Color and magnitude cuts have been made assuming an E(B - V) = 0.55 mag +/- 0.1, which is a good approximation close to the center of Trumpler 16. These lists have been cross-correlated with X-ray sources found in the Chandra Carina Complex Project. Previous studies have shown that only very rarely (if at all) do late main-sequence B stars produce X-rays. We present evidence that the X-ray-detected sources are binaries with low-mass companions, since stars less massive than 1.4 M☉ are strong X-ray sources at the age of the cluster. Both the median X-ray energies and X-ray luminosities of these sources are in good agreement with values for typical low-mass coronal X-ray sources. We find that 39% of the late B stars based on a list with proper motions have low-mass companions. Similarly, 32% of a sample without proper motions have low-mass companions. We discuss the X-ray detection completeness. These results on low-mass companions of intermediate-mass stars are complementary to spectroscopic and interferometric results and probe new parameter space of low-mass companions at all separations.

Suppose a transaction at a lower security level attempts to write a data item that is being read by a transaction at a higher security level. On the one hand, a timing covert channel arises if the transaction at the lower security level is either delayed or aborted by the scheduler. On the other hand, the transaction at the high security level may be subjected to an indefinite delay if it is forced to abort repeatedly. This paper extends the classical two-phase locking mechanism to multilevel secure file systems. The scheme presented here prevents potential timing covert channels and avoids the abort of higher level transactions nonetheless guaranteeing serializability. The programmer is provided with a powerful set of linguistic constructs that supports exception handling, partial rollback, and forward recovery.

Using the proposed cost models, we have also developed an algorithm for the efficient index allocation on a given path, given a workload specified in terms of operation frequencies.

The objective is to control the conditional PDF of the system output to follow a given target function by using dynamic neural network models. B-spline neural networks are used to model the dynamic output probability density functions (PDFs), then the concerned problem is transferred into the tracking of given weights corresponding to the desired PDF. The dynamic neural networks with undetermined parameters are employed to identify the nonlinear relationships between the control input and the weights. To achieve control objective, an adaptive state feedback controller is given to estimate the unknown parameters and control the nonlinear dynamics.', 'corpus_id': 43643177, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '424163', 'title': 'Reliable Observer-Based Control Against Sensor Failures for Systems With Time Delays in Both State and Input', 'abstract': 'For systems with both state and input time delays, a novel state and sensor fault observer is proposed in this paper to estimate system states and sensor faults simultaneously. In this design, a descriptor system approach and a linear matrix inequality technique are adopted, where the considered sensor fault may be in any form, even unbounded. Unbounded sensor faults will make the system fail unavoidably; it is indispensable to derive a reliable control scheme against sensor failures. Using the estimated state and sensor fault, a reliable observer-based controller is proposed, which makes the system work well no matter whether sensor faults occur or not. The present approaches are next extended to the case for systems with multiple time delays. Finally, a simulation example of the network of three cascaded reactors is used to illustrate the design procedure and demonstrate the efficiency of the present techniques.', 'corpus_id': 424163, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '36127171', 'title': 'Packing Three Copies of a Tree into a Complete Graph', 'abstract': 'Abstract A three T of order n is said to be 3-placeable if there are three edge-disjoint copies of T in Kn.

Volunteer computing platforms have the potential to provide massive computing power. However, privacy and security concerns prevent using volunteer computing for data mining of sensitive data. The Cell processor comes with a hardware security feature. The secure volunteer data mining can be achieved by using this hardware security feature. In this paper, we present a general security scheme for the volunteer computing, and a secure parallelized K-Means clustering algorithm for the Cell processor. We also evaluate the performance of the algorithm on the Cell secure system simulator. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed secure data clustering outperforms a non-secure clustering algorithm on the general purpose CPU, but incurs a huge performance overhead introduced by the decryption process of the Cell security features.', 'corpus_id': 7096747, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '205433865', 'title': 'Model reference adaptive control of the output stochastic distributions for unknown linear stochastic systems', 'abstract': 'This paper presents a model reference based adaptive control approach for the control of the output probability density function for unknown linear time-invariant stochastic systems. Different from most existing models used in stochastic control, it is assumed here that the measured control input directly affects the distribution of the system output in probability sense. As such, the purpose of control is to make the shape of the probability density function of the system output as close as possible to a prespecified one. Using the weighted integration of the measurable output probability density functions, two adaptive on-line updating rules are developed which guarantee the global stability for theclosed loop adaptive control system under certain conditions. Ithas been shown, when there is no external disturbance, that the so-formed closed loop system also realizes the perfect tracking (i.e., the probability density function of the system output approaches a class of given distributions asymptotically)...', 'corpus_id': 205433865, 'score': 0}]"
