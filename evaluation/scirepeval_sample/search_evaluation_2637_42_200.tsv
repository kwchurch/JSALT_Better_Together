When any fault like short circuit and earth fault occurs, the length of the fault of the cable can be determined from the fault resistance using the bridge in the Varley loop. The other method is based on electromagnetic sensing and finds the exact location of the fault. When the current flows through the cable, an electromagnetic field is induced, which is sensed by an inductive coil connected to the electronic amplifier circuit.

Keywords ARM cortex,coocox, INTRODUCTION Underground cables have been widely applied in power distribution networks due to the benefits of underground connection, involving more secure than overhead lines in bad weather, less liable to damage by storms or lightning, no susceptible to trees, less expensive for shorter distance, environment friendly and low maintenance. Every cable has its own resistance. As the length of the cable increases, so does the resistance value of the particular cable increase. The only disadvantages of utilizing underground cables is that, it is 8 to 15 times more expensive than equivalent overhead lines, more liable to permanent damage following a flash over, and difficult to locate fault. Faults in underground cables can be normally classified as two categories: incipient faults and permanent faults. Usually, incipient faults in power cables are gradually resulted from the aging process, where the localized deterioration in insulations exists. Electrical overstress in conjunction with mechanical deficiency, unfavorable environmental condition and chemical pollution, can cause the irreparable and irreversible damages in insulations. Eventually, incipient faults would fail into permanent faults sooner or later. The detection of incipient faults can provide an early warning for the breakdown of the defective cable, even trip the suspected feeder to limit the repetitive voltage transients. The location of permanent faults in cables is essential for electric power distribution networks to improve network reliability, ensure customer power quality, speed up restoration process, minimize outage time, reduce repairing cost, dispatch crews more efficiently and maintain network reliability. The state estimation (SE) is an auxiliary tool to provide the necessary information for the proposed location algorithms. The related methods published in journals and proceedings are reviewed, summarized and compared in the next subsections.

Although production plants that find their economic justification mostly on the expenditure side of reduction of production costs and production processes, the modern business requires a change of the income side, where development of relations with consumers has more important role. Production of bakery products had all the features of mass production until recently. Due to the importance of bakery products in the nutrition of people, particularly in developed parts of the world, demand for bakery products could be considered as non elastic, since the price, quality and range of bakery products were basically irrelevant to the volume of demand for these products. However, at the end of the twentieth century the purchasing power of the population, as well as the level of information, knowledge and self awareness, significantly influenced the consumption of bakery products. The modern consumer changes the structure of food in the nutrition and he is no longer satisfied with a mass produced product, but requires a product that is ""tailored"" according to his needs.

With more than ten billion mobile applications downloaded, they provide a broad basis for reaching clients in both developed and emerging markets. In 2009, first insurers have cautiously started to explore mobile applications as a channel to sell products, provide assistance services, and manage claims. However, practical knowledge on the status quo of using mobile applications in the insurance industry is scarce and academic contributions in the field of mobile customer relationship management remain partial. The work explores the state of the art in mobile insurance applications and demonstrates not yet explored benefits and downsides based on five research questions. Answers to the questions rendered results that provide insights on the current status of mobile customer relationship management in insurance and offer a basis for companies to take the right steps when developing and offering these applications. First, a repository of mobile applications and functionalities is built to help insurers compare their own development efforts and ideas with the best practices on the market. The preferences of the customers are assessed to provide insights on the features that are demanded by their clients. The results show that most insurers follow a short term strategy which results in a lacking integration of products and processes. The applications are hardly integrated with the corporate IT and mostly support assistance and claims processes for motor insurance. Second, the usage behavior is explored since companies assess the utilization of the applications rarely. While the findings state that the continued use of the applications dilutes quickly, they also prove that the services are reused due to positive experience. Third, mobile assistance services are investigated to understand how they contribute to generating positive word of mouth and strengthening the insurer's brand. Empirical results reveal that clients with trust in the company and the service show a high affinity to engage in word of mouth communication.

The work closes with guidelines for insurers and implications for mobile customer relationship management and discloses demand for future research.Mobile technologies have evolved as new means for companies to interact and communicate with their customers. With more than ten billion mobile applications downloaded, they provide a broad basis for reaching clients in both developed and emerging markets. In 2009, first insurers have cautiously started to explore mobile applications as a channel to sell products, provide assistance services, and manage claims. However, practical knowledge on the status quo of using mobile applications in the insurance industry is scarce and academic contributions in the field of mobile customer relationship management remain partial. The work explores the state of the art in mobile insurance applications and demonstrates not yet explored benefits and downsides based on five research questions. Answers to the questions rendered results that provide insights on the current status of mobile customer relationship management in insurance and offer a basis for companies to take the right steps when developing and offering these applications. First, a repository of mobile applications and functionalities is built to help insurers compare their own development efforts and ideas with the best practices on the market. The preferences of the customers are assessed to provide insights on the features that are demanded by their clients. The results show that most insurers follow a short term strategy which results in a lacking integration of products and processes. The applications are hardly integrated with the corporate IT and mostly support assistance and claims processes for motor insurance. Second, the usage behavior is explored since companies assess the utilization of the applications rarely. While the findings state that the continued use of the applications dilutes quickly, they also prove that the services are reused due to positive experience. Third, mobile assistance services are investigated to understand how they contribute to generating positive word of mouth and strengthening the insurer's brand. Empirical results reveal that clients with trust in the company and the service show a high affinity to engage in word of mouth communication. Fourth, a mobile car navigation application is considered to explain how the purchasing decision can be influenced. The evidence found suggests that revenue can be generated by extending insurance offerings with mobile applications.

Their poor written language skills markedly impair their scholastic performance and are often associated with other mental disorders. A great deal of uncertainty still surrounds the question of the appropriate methods of diagnosis and treatment. METHODS We systematically searched for pertinent publications in databases and literature reference lists, summarized the evidence in six tables, and examined some of it in a meta analysis. Recommendations were developed in a consensus conference. RESULTS A reading and/or spelling disorder should only be diagnosed if performance in these areas is below average. It should be determined whether an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, or disorder of arithmetical skills is also present. Reading and spelling performance should be reinforced with systematic instruction about letter sound and sound letter correspondences, letter syllable morpheme synthesis, and sound syllablemorpheme analysis (g' 0.32) (recommendation grade A) Spelling ability responds best to spelling rule training (recommendation grade A) Irlen lenses, visual and/or auditory perceptual training, hemispheric stimulation, piracetam, and prism spectacles should not be used (recommendation grade A) CONCLUSION Evidence and consensus based guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of reading and/or spelling disorders in children and adolescents are now available for the first time. Reading and spelling abilities should be systematically and comprehensively reinforced, and potential comorbid disorders should be sought and treated appropriately. The efficacy of many treatments now in use has not been documented; if they are to be used in the future, they must be tested in randomized, controlled trials.

Thus, we applied a 2 (reading disability: yes vs. no) x 2 (spelling disability: yes vs. no) factorial design to examine distinct and overlapping working memory profiles associated with learning disabilities in reading versus spelling.

Our results show that although children with spelling difficulties made fewer errors in the copying task than under dictation, they still made phonological errors and mistakes relating to accents and duplicates.

Thirty one children with dyslexia (Mage 9 years 4 months) were compared with age matched and spelling ability matched children (Mage 6 years 6 months) A digital writing tablet and Eye and Pen software were used to analyze handwriting. Children with dyslexia were able to execute handwriting at the same speed as the age matched peers. However, they wrote less overall and paused more frequently while writing, especially within words. Combined spelling ability and within word pausing accounted for over 76% of the variance in handwriting production of children with dyslexia, demonstrating that productivity relies on spelling capabilities. Motor skill did not significantly predict any additional variance in handwriting production. Reading ability predicted performance of the age matched group, and pausing predicted performance for the spelling ability group. The findings from the digital writing tablet highlight the interactive relationship between the transcription skills and how, if spelling is not fully automatized, it can constrain the rate of handwriting production.

Ustekinumab was also evaluated as subcutaneous maintenance therapy. METHODS We randomly assigned patients to receive a single intravenous dose of ustekinumab (either 130 mg or approximately 6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo in two induction trials. The UNITI 1 trial included 741 patients who met the criteria for primary or secondary nonresponse to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists or had unacceptable side effects. The UNITI 2 trial included 628 patients in whom conventional therapy failed or unacceptable side effects occurred. Patients who completed these induction trials then participated in IM UNITI, in which the 397 patients who had a response to ustekinumab were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous maintenance injections of 90 mg of ustekinumab (either every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks) or placebo. The primary end point for the induction trials was a clinical response at week 6 (defined as a decrease from baseline in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of =100 points or a CDAI score <150) The primary end point for the maintenance trial was remission at week 44 (CDAI score <150) RESULTS The rates of response at week 6 among patients receiving intravenous ustekinumab at a dose of either 130 mg or approximately 6 mg per kilogram were significantly higher than the rates among patients receiving placebo (in UNITI 1, 34.3% 33.7% and 21.5% respectively, with P<=0.003 for both comparisons with placebo; in UNITI 2, 51.7% 55.5% and 28.7% respectively, with P<0.001 for both doses) In the groups receiving maintenance doses of ustekinumab every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks, 53.1% and 48.8% respectively, were in remission at week 44, as compared with 35.9% of those receiving placebo (P=0.005 and P=0.04, respectively) Within each trial, adverse event rates were similar among treatment groups.

METHODS We evaluated ustekinumab in adults with moderate to severe Crohn's disease that was resistant to anti tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment. During induction, 526 patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ustekinumab (at a dose of 1, 3, or 6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo at week 0. During the maintenance phase, 145 patients who had a response to ustekinumab at 6 weeks underwent a second randomization to receive subcutaneous injections of ustekinumab (90 mg) or placebo at weeks 8 and 16.

Recent data have demonstrated that the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine could reduce disease severity and the burden of several infectious diseases in addition to targeting its primary focus tuberculosis. There is growing evidence for the concept of beneficial non specific boosting of immune responses by BCG or other microbial compounds termed trained immunity, which may protect against COVID 19. In this manuscript, we review data on how the development of innate immune memory due to microbial compounds specifically BCG can result in protection against SARS CoV 2 infection. We also discuss possible mechanisms, challenges and perspectives of using innate immunity as an approach to reduce COVID 19 severity.', 'corpus_id': 229364245, 'venue': 'Clinical translational immunology', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Yahya Sohrabi', 'Jessica Cristina dos Santos', 'Marc Dorenkamp', 'Hannes M Findeisen', 'Rinesh Godfrey', 'Mihai G Netea', 'Leo A B Joosten'], 'n_citations': 12, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '228785245', 'title': 'COVID 19 vaccines that reduce symptoms but do not block infection need higher coverage and faster rollout to achieve population impact', 'abstract': ""Background: Several COVID 19 vaccine candidates are in the final stage of testing. Interim trial results for two vaccines suggest at least 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease (VEDIS) It remains unknown whether this efficacy is mediated predominately by lowering SARS CoV 2 infection susceptibility (VESUSC) or development of symptoms after infection (VESYMP) A vaccine with high VESYMP but low VESUSC has uncertain population impact. Methods: We developed a mathematical model of SARS CoV 2 transmission, calibrated to demographic, physical distancing and epidemic data from King County, Washington. Different rollout scenarios starting December 2020 were simulated assuming different combinations of VESUSC and VESYMP resulting in up to 100% VEDIS with constant vaccine effects over 1 year. We assumed no further increase in physical distancing despite expanding case numbers and no reduction of infectivity upon infection conditional on presence of symptoms. Proportions of cumulative infections, hospitalizations and deaths prevented over 1 year from vaccination start are reported. Results: Rollouts of 1M vaccinations (5,000 daily) using vaccines with 50% VEDIS are projected to prevent 30% 58% of infections and 38% 58% of deaths over one year. In comparison, vaccines with 90% VEDIS are projected to prevent 47% 78% of the infections and 58% 77% of deaths over one year. In both cases, there is a greater reduction if VEDIS is mediated mostly by VESUSC. The use of a 'symptom reducing' vaccine will require twice as many people vaccinated than a 'susceptibility reducing' vaccine with the same 90% VEDIS to prevent 50% of the infections and death over one year. Delaying the start of the vaccination by 3 months decreases the expected population impact by approximately 40% Conclusions: Vaccines which prevent COVID 19 disease but not SARS CoV 2 infection, and thereby shift symptomatic infections to asymptomatic infections, will prevent fewer infections and require larger and faster vaccination rollouts to have population impact, compared to vaccines that reduce susceptibility to infection. If uncontrolled transmission across the U.S. continues, then expected vaccination in Spring 2021 will provide only limited benefit."", 'corpus_id': 228785245, 'venue': 'medRxiv', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['David A Swan', 'Chloe Bracis', 'Holly E Janes', 'M Moore', 'Laura Matrajt', 'Daniel B Reeves', 'Eileen Burns', 'Deborah Donnell', 'M S Cohen', 'Joshua T Schiffer', 'Dimitar Dimitrov'], 'n_citations': 14, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '231654082', 'title': 'mRNA COVID 19 vaccine is well tolerated in patients with cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis with mast cell activation symptoms and anaphylaxis', 'abstract': '', 'corpus_id': 231654082, 'venue': 'Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology', 'year': 2021.0, 'author_names': ['Tiago Azenha Rama', 'Andre Moreira', 'Mariana C Castells'], 'n_citations': 13, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}]"

Thus, we develop a new measure of systemic risk with a test of our hypothesis that separates systemic risk from systematic risk. We also consider the firm level determinants of contributions to systemic risk using a fixed effects model and a logit model. Using data on companies in the CSI 300 index from 2008 to 2016, we find that our extreme value theory (EVT) copula method is a good fit for testing the joint probability distribution of extreme returns as well as diverse dependence patterns with asymmetry and non linearity characteristics. The empirical results provide evidence against the marginal expected shortfall (MES) method without a mechanism to test the statistical significance of determination. Several non financial firms, though not all financial institutions, can generate significant spillover effects on the financial system. Our regression results suggest that, among firms with a significantly positive contribution to systemic risk, smaller firms have greater spillover effects on the financial system in China.

Our empirical results show a significant systemic time lag for various institutions. The size of this time lag and the related systemic risk (measured by CoSP) depend on the respective institution and market. In general, we find that brokers exhibit the most persistent systemic impact on all considered markets, whereas non financial companies have the smallest systemic persistence.

We utilize the bright channel prior to get an initial transmission estimate and then use the dark channel as a complementary channel to correct potentially erroneous transmission estimates attained from the bright channel prior.

It is frequently encountered that the illumination condition, while capturing the image, is imperfect. Specific algorithms have to be applied to restore these images from, for instance, the degradation due to low illumination. An adaptive enhancement method is developed here that tackles the image quality enhancement problem from an optimization perspective. In particular, the input image intensity is mapped to the output based on a weighted hybrid of a hyperbolic tangent and a linear profile. The mapping parameters are optimized, with regard to maximizing the image global entropy, by using the Golden Section Search algorithm for its implementation efficiency.

Under the high illumination, Tai Chi exercise participants exhibited higher loading rate and anteroposterior centre of pressure (COPap) displacement as well as a lower braking impulse than no exercise group. Under the low illumination, Tai Chi exercise participants demonstrated higher COPap and mediolateral centre of pressure (COPml) displacements as well as lower braking and lateral impulses compared with no exercise participants.

Initial epidemiological studies suggested a predilection for older adult males with comorbidities due to their immunocompromised status and very rarely, coinfection with bacteria and fungi. An exponential increase in the number of nonlinked cases in the late December 2019 pointed toward the risk of human to human transmission. Similar to its predecessor, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) also acts on the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on the type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. ACE2 expression has been found to be higher in males than females and in Asian populations compared to White and African American populations. This led to an agreement that the Asian males were more susceptible to SARS CoV 2 infection. The ability of SARS CoV 2 to bind to ACE2 receptor was found to be 10 20 times more than that of the SARS CoV, thus making the new pathogen much more aggressive.

Phage therapy, the use of viruses that infect and kill bacteria, is an approach gaining significant clinical interest to combat antibiotic resistant infections. However, a major limitation is that bacteria can develop resistance against phages. Here, we isolated phages with activity against a panel of A. baumannii strains and focused on clinical isolates AB900 and A9844 and their phages for detailed characterization. As expected, coincubation of the phages with their hosts in vitro resulted in the emergence of phage resistant bacterial mutants. Genome sequence analysis revealed that phage resistant mutants harbored loss of function mutations in genes from the K locus, responsible for the biosynthesis of the bacterial capsule. Using molecular biology techniques, phage adsorption assays, and quantitative evaluation of capsule production, we established that the bacterial capsule serves as the primary receptor for these phages. As a collateral phenotype of impaired capsule production, the phage resistant strains could not form biofilms, became fully sensitized to the human complement system, showed increased susceptibility to beta lactam antibiotics, and became vulnerable to additional phages. Finally, in a murine model of bacteremia, the phage resistant A. baumannii demonstrated a diminished capacity to colonize blood and solid tissues. This study demonstrates that phages can be used not only for their lytic activity but, if combined with a posteriori knowledge of their receptors and the mechanism of bacterial resistance, for their potential synergy with other antimicrobial agents, thus providing even broader clinical options for phage therapy.', 'corpus_id': 214459109, 'venue': '', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Fernando Gordillo Altamirano', 'John H Forsyth', 'Ruzeen Rohintan Patwa', 'Xenia Kostoulias', 'Michael Trim', 'Dinesh Subedi', 'Stuart Archer', 'Faye C Morris', 'Cody Oliveira', 'Luisa Kielty', 'Denis Korneev', ""Moira K O'Bryan"", 'Trevor Lithgow', 'Anton Y Peleg', 'Jeremy J Barr'], 'n_citations': 4, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '211476358', 'title': 'Fitness Trade Offs Resulting from Bacteriophage Resistance Potentiate Synergistic Antibacterial Strategies', 'abstract': 'Bacteria that cause life threatening infections in humans are becoming increasingly difficult to treat.

ABSTRACT Bacteria that cause life threatening infections in humans are becoming increasingly difficult to treat. In some instances, this is due to intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance, indicating that new therapeutic approaches are needed to combat bacterial pathogens. There is renewed interest in utilizing viruses of bacteria known as bacteriophages (phages) as potential antibacterial therapeutics. However, critics suggest that similar to antibiotics, the development of phage resistant bacteria will halt clinical phage therapy. Although the emergence of phage resistant bacteria is likely inevitable, there is a growing body of literature showing that phage selective pressure promotes mutations in bacteria that allow them to subvert phage infection, but with a cost to their fitness. Such fitness trade offs include reduced virulence, resensitization to antibiotics, and colonization defects. Resistance to phage nucleic acid entry, primarily via cell surface modifications, compromises bacterial fitness during antibiotic and host immune system pressure. In this minireview, we explore the mechanisms behind phage resistance in bacterial pathogens and the physiological consequences of acquiring phage resistance phenotypes. With this knowledge, it may be possible to use phages to alter bacterial populations, making them more tractable to current therapeutic strategies.', 'corpus_id': 211476358, 'venue': 'Infection and Immunity', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Mihnea R Mangalea', 'Breck A Duerkop'], 'n_citations': 27, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '26521730', 'title': 'Bacteriophages Contribute to the Spread of Antibiotic Resistance Genes among Foodborne Pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae Family A Review', 'abstract': 'Foodborne illnesses continue to have an economic impact on global health care systems. There is a growing concern regarding the increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacterial pathogens and how such resistance may affect treatment outcomes. In an effort to better understand how to reduce the spread of resistance, many research studies have been conducted regarding the methods by which antibiotic resistance genes are mobilized and spread between bacteria. Transduction by bacteriophages (phages) is one of many horizontal gene transfer mechanisms, and recent findings have shown phage mediated transduction to be a significant contributor to dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. Here, we review the viability of transduction as a contributing factor to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in foodborne pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including non typhoidal Salmonella and Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli, as well as environmental factors that increase transduction of antibiotic resistance genes.', 'corpus_id': 26521730, 'venue': 'Front.

Bacteriophage (phage) has been hailed as one possible therapeutic option to augment the efficacy of antibiotics. However, only a handful of studies have addressed the synergistic relationship between phage and antibiotics. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of phage antibiotic interaction that evaluates synergism, additivism, and antagonism for all classes of antibiotics across clinically achievable stoichiometries. We combined an optically based real time microtiter plate readout with a matrix like heatmap of treatment potencies to measure phage and antibiotic synergy (PAS) a process we term synography. Phage antibiotic synography was performed against a pandemic drug resistant clonal group of E. coli (ExPEC) with antibiotic levels blanketing the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) across seven orders of viral titers. Our results suggest that, under certain conditions, phages provide an adjuvating effect by lowering the MIC for drug resistant strains. Furthermore, synergistic and antagonistic interactions are highly dependent on the mechanism of bacterial inhibition by the class of antibiotic paired to the phage, and when synergism is observed, it suppresses the emergence of resistant cells. Host conditions that simulate the infection environment, including serum and urine, suppress PAS in a bacterial growth dependent manner. Lastly, phage burst size seems to be a significant driver of synergism. Collectively, this data suggests lytic phages can resuscitate an ineffective antibiotic for previously resistant bacteria, while also synergize with antibiotics in a class dependent manner, processes that may be dampened by lower bacterial growth rates found in host environments. Significance Statement Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising approach to combat the rise of multi drug resistant bacteria. Currently, the preferred clinical modality is to pair phage with an antibiotic, a practice thought to improve efficacy. However, antagonism between phage and antibiotics has been reported, the choice of phage and antibiotic is not often empirically determined, and the effect of the host factors on the effectiveness is unknown. Here, we interrogate phage antibiotic interactions across antibiotics with different mechanisms of action.

Results show that phage selection produces an evolutionary trade off in MDR P. aeruginosa, whereby the evolution of bacterial resistance to phage attack changes the efflux pump mechanism, causing increased sensitivity to drugs from several antibiotic classes. Although modern phage therapy is still in its infancy, we conclude that phages, such as OMKO1, represent a new approach to phage therapy where bacteriophages exert selection for MDR bacteria to become increasingly sensitive to traditional antibiotics.

SUMMARY Antibiotic resistance is arguably the biggest current threat to global health. An increasing number of infections are becoming harder or almost impossible to treat, carrying high morbidity, mortality, and financial cost. The therapeutic use of bacteriophages, viruses that infect and kill bacteria, is well suited to be part of the multidimensional strategies to combat antibiotic resistance. Although phage therapy was first implemented almost a century ago, it was brought to a standstill after the successful introduction of antibiotics. Now, with the rise of antibiotic resistance, phage therapy is experiencing a well deserved rebirth. Among the admittedly vast literature recently published on this topic, this review aims to provide a forward looking perspective on phage therapy and its role in modern society. We cover the key points of the antibiotic resistance crisis and then explain the biological and evolutionary principles that support the use of phages, their interaction with the immune system, and a comparison with antibiotic therapy. By going through up to date reports and, whenever possible, human clinical trials, we examine the versatility of phage therapy. We discuss conventional approaches as well as novel strategies, including the use of phage antibiotic combinations, phage derived enzymes, exploitation of phage resistance mechanisms, and phage bioengineering. Finally, we discuss the benefits of phage therapy beyond the clinical perspective, including opportunities for scientific outreach and effective education, interdisciplinary collaboration, cultural and economic growth, and even innovative use of social media, making the case that phage therapy is more than just an alternative to antibiotics.', 'corpus_id': 58655151, 'venue': 'Clinical Microbiology Reviews', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Fernando L Gordillo Altamirano', 'Jeremy J Barr'], 'n_citations': 191, 'n_key_citations': 4, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '53712412', 'title': 'Phage Therapy: Going Temperate?', 'abstract': 'Strictly lytic phages have been consensually preferred for phage therapy purposes.

The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS) BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster.

Often, existing data sets may not be published due to privacy concerns or do not reflect actual and current attack scenarios. In order to overcome these problems, we identify characteristics of good data sets and develop an appropriate concept for the generation of labelled flow based data sets that satisfy these criteria. The concept is implemented based on OpenStack, thus demonstrating the suitability of virtual environments. Virtual environments offer advantages compared to static data sets by easily creating up to date data sets with recent trends in user behaviour and new attack scenarios. In particular, we emulate a small business environment which includes several clients and typical servers. Network traffic is generated by scripts which emulate typical user activities like surfing the web, writing emails, or printing documents on the clients. These scripts follow some guidelines to ensure that the user behaviour is as realistic as possible, also with respect to working hours and lunch breaks. The generated network traffic is recorded in unidirectional NetFlow format. For generating malicious traffic, attacks like Denial of Service, Brute Force, and Port Scans are executed within the network. Since origins, targets, and timestamps of executed attacks are known, labelling of recorded NetFlow data is easily possible. For inclusion of actual traffic, which has its origin outside the OpenStack environment, an external server with two services is deployed. This server has a public IP address and is exposed to real and up to date attacks from the internet. We captured approximately 32 million flows over a period of four weeks and categorized them into five classes. Further, the chronological sequence of the flows is analysed and the distribution of normal and malicious traffic is discussed in detail.

An IDS, on the other hand, automates the monitoring process in computer networks. The streaming nature of data in computer networks poses a significant challenge in building IDS. In this paper, a method is proposed to overcome this problem by performing online classification on datasets. In doing so, an incremental naive Bayesian classifier is employed.

The mutation results in the production of hemoglobin HbS which differs from the normal HbAin that it tends to polymerize into long strands that deform the erythrocyte. While a variety of traditional treatment regimens or reagents, such as hydroxyurea and chronic transfusions have been used widely, these therapies are wrought with short and long term side effects that limit efficacy. There is great interest in the hypothesis that the repair of a single nucleotide is facilitated by the combined action of CRISPR/Cas 9 and single stranded oligonucleotides (ssODNs) could prove a significant therapeutic advance for sickle cell disease. CRISPR/Cas 9 induces a site specific double stranded break while the single stranded oligonucleotide provides a DNA template to improve the rate of accurate genetic correction. There is a great effort to understand off site mutagenesis caused by editing of DNA regions remote to the target sequence. It is critical that investigators understand the frequency and types of DNA alterations induced by the gene editing reaction and affecting the region surrounding the targeted nucleotide site (herein termed on site mutagenesis) Methods We targeted beta globin genes with a CRISPR/Cas9 system designed to cleave 2 bases to the 59side of the targeted (A) nucleotide (the PAM site is located 2 bases to the 39 side on the complimentary strand) coupled to the electroporation of a single stranded oligonucleotide (72 mer) designed to convert the wild type (A) to the mutant (T) nucleotide. To evaluate the rate of on site mutagenesis among individual alleles, we clonally expanded populations of edited K562 cells. We hypothesize that the evaluation of individual clones will permit a clear identification of intended and un intended on site DNA alteration. Allelic heterogeneity is analyzed using Tracking of Indels by DEcompositon (TIDE) methodology combined with Sanger sequencing. Results We isolated 26 clonal lines for continued expansion after evidence of CRISPR/Cas 9 plasmid uptake and activity. Sanger sequencing with TIDE analysis revealed that the DNA sequence surrounding the targeted base is altered significantly as a result of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing process. Twenty three percent of the clones contain at least one corrected allele but one hundred percent of the clones exhibited mutagenicity of the DNA sequence surrounding the targeted base. All clones analyzed displayed varying degrees of sequence alteration (Figure 1) Interestingly, one clone contained a DNA insertion homologous to a region of the delta globin gene, suggesting that gene editing of the beta globin gene may have been repaired, in part, by delta globin DNA. The sequence of the delta globin locus was not changed. Conclusions Taken together, our data suggest that combinatorial approaches to beta globin gene editing using CRISPR/Cas 9 and single stranded oligonucleotides induce significant onsite mutagenesis and potential genetic swapping between related members of the same gene family. These observations provide insight into the type of molecular activity that accompanies combinatorial gene editing, particularly surrounding the target site.

Association of the mutated b chain with a chain results in the formation of hemoglobin S, which polymerizes intracellularly thus causing erythrocyte sickling. One promising therapy relies on the transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a wild type or mutant b globin gene. However, one of the main concerns associated with the use of recombinant retroviruses to deliver therapeutic genes in stem cells is the risk of insertional mutagenesis following semi random retroviral DNA integration. Alternatively, gene repair by homology directed repair (HDR) is recognized as a potentially less genotoxic approach to repair mutations. Although HDR is intrinsically inefficient in human cells, enzymes that create specific DNA double strand breaks can efficiently increase HDR frequency. Our long term goal is to develop an efficient HDR approach to repair the sickle cell anemia mutation in stem cells. We have previously evaluated meganucleases and TALEN based approaches to edit the b globin gene in a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell line carrying a homozygous sickle cell mutation.

In practice, the training is usually conducted in an asynchronous parallel manner, where workers can proceed to the next iteration before receiving the latest model parameters. While this maximizes the rate of updates, the price paid is compromised training quality as the computation is usually performed using stale model parameters. To address this problem, we propose a new scheme, termed speculative synchronization. Our scheme allows workers to speculate about the recent parameter updates from others on the fly, and if necessary, the workers abort the ongoing computation, pull fresher parameters, and start over to improve the quality of training. We design an effective heuristic algorithm to judiciously determine when to restart training iterations with fresher parameters by quantifying the gain and loss.

This paper proposes ADSP, a parameter synchronization scheme for distributed machine learning (ML) with heterogeneous edge systems.

At the same time, A DSP also implements the AdaptFR load balancing strategy, which addresses the straggler problem caused by the performance difference between nodes under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of the model.

However, for this Geo distributed machine learning (Geo DML) it is infeasible to move all data together over wide area networks (WANs) due to scarce WAN bandwidth, privacy concerns and data sovereignty laws. Therefore, most Geo DML systems leverage geo distributed approaches to train models, where global model synchronization is required between DCs over WAN. With the rapid increase of training data and the model sizes, it is challenging to efficiently utilize scarce and heterogeneous WAN bandwidth to synchronize models. With the advancement of optical technology, network topology becomes reconfigurable in optical WAN, which brings a new opportunity for Geo DML training over WAN. We propose to optimize Geo DML training with centralized joint control of the network and reconfigurable optical layers. We respectively prove the intra job and inter job scheduling problems are NP hard and strongly NP hard. For intra job scheduling, RoWAN based on deterministic rounding algorithm, is presented to dynamically change the topology by reconfiguring the optical devices, and allocate path and rate for each flow. For inter job scheduling, delayed SWRT is provided to schedule multiple jobs according to their priorities. The simulations in real topologies show that RoWAN reduces global model synchronization communication time of single iteration by up to 15.54% 48.2% on average in comparison with the traditional solutions.

However, inefficient communication is also one of the reasons for the inefficiency of DML iterations.

Our network, named PointNet, provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.', 'corpus_id': 5115938, 'venue': '2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)', 'year': 2017.0, 'author_names': ['C Qi', 'Hao Su', 'Kaichun Mo', 'Leonidas J Guibas'], 'n_citations': 4772, 'n_key_citations': 1463, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '201645228', 'title': 'Linking Points With Labels in 3D: A Review of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation', 'abstract': 'Ripe with possibilities offered by deep learning techniques and useful in applications related to remote sensing, computer vision, and robotics, 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) and point cloud segmentation (PCS) are attracting increasing interest.

To reduce the considerable requirement of fine annotations, a CNN based classifier is trained by considering both supervised samples with manually labeled object classes and pairwise constraints, where a data sample is composed of a segment as the foreground and neighborhood points as the background. A special loss function is designed to account for both annotations and constraints, where the constraint data are encouraged to be assigned to the same semantic class. A dataset containing 1838 frames of LiDAR data, 39 934 pairwise constraints and 57 927 human annotations is developed. The performance of the method is examined extensively.

Furthermore, a joint instance semantic segmentation module is developed to transform semantic features into instance embedding space, and then the transformed features are further fused with instance features to facilitate instance segmentation. Meanwhile, this module also aggregates instance features into semantic feature space to promote semantic segmentation. Finally, the instance predictions are generated by applying a simple mean shift clustering on instance embeddings. As a result, we evaluate the proposed JSNet on a large scale 3D indoor point cloud dataset S3DIS and a part dataset ShapeNet, and compare it with existing approaches.

Since the geometric distribution of the neighboring points is invariant to the point ordering, we propose a Local Attention Edge Convolution (LAE Conv) to construct a local graph based on the neighborhood points searched in multi directions. We assign attention coefficients to each edge and then aggregate the point features as a weighted sum of its neighbors. The learned LAE Conv layer features are then given to a point wise spatial attention module to generate an interdependency matrix of all points regardless of their distances, which captures long range spatial contextual features contributing to more precise semantic information.

Here we report a high GABA (g aminobutyric acid) content in reactive astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of a mouse model for AD (5xFAD) that results in increased tonic inhibition and memory deficit. We also confirm in human AD patient brains that dentate astrocytes have a high GABA content, suggesting that high astrocytic GABA level may be a novel biomarker and a potential diagnostic tool for AD. The excessive GABA in 5xFAD astrocytes is released through an astrocyte specific GABA transporter GAT3/4, and significantly enhanced tonic GABA inhibition in dentate granule cells. Importantly, reducing tonic inhibition in 5xFAD mice rescues the impairment of long term potentiation (LTP) and memory deficit. Thus, reducing tonic GABA inhibition in the DG may lead to a novel therapy for Alzheimer's disease."", 'corpus_id': 16399047, 'venue': 'Nature communications', 'year': 2014.0, 'author_names': ['Zheng Da Wu', 'Ziyuan Guo', 'Marla Gearing', 'Gong Chen'], 'n_citations': 177, 'n_key_citations': 11, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '3997851', 'title': ""Lack of evidence for dysfunction of the blood brain barrier in Alzhiemer's disease: An immunohistochemical study"", 'abstract': ""With immunohistoperoxidase techniques the presence of plasma (serum) proteins was investigated in senile plaques, congophilic angiopathy, neurons and glial cells in brains of patients with Alzheimer's dementia.

EAAT4 and GLAST/EAAT1 are the two predominant EAATs responsible for maintaining low extracellular glutamate levels and preventing neurotoxicity in the cerebellum, the brain region essential for motor control. Here using genetically modified mice we identify new critical roles for EAAT4 and GLAST/EAAT1 as modulators of Purkinje cell (PC) spontaneous firing patterns. We show high EAAT4 levels, by limiting mGluR1 signalling, are essential in constraining inherently heterogeneous firing of zebrin positive PCs. Moreover mGluR1 antagonists were found to restore regular spontaneous PC activity and motor behaviour in EAAT4 knockout mice. In contrast, GLAST/EAAT1 expression is required to sustain normal spontaneous simple spike activity in low EAAT4 expressing (zebrin negative) PCs by restricting NMDA receptor activation. Blockade of NMDA receptor activity restores spontaneous activity in zebrin negative PCs of GLAST knockout mice and furthermore alleviates motor deficits. In addition both transporters have differential effects on PC survival, with zebrin negative PCs more vulnerable to loss of GLAST/EAAT1 and zebrin positive PCs more vulnerable to loss of EAAT4. These findings reveal that glutamate transporter dysfunction through elevated extracellular glutamate and the aberrant activation of extrasynaptic receptors can disrupt cerebellar output by altering spontaneous PC firing. This expands our understanding of disease mechanisms in cerebellar ataxias and establishes EAATs as targets for restoring homeostasis in a variety of neurological diseases where altered cerebellar output is now thought to play a key role in pathogenesis."", 'corpus_id': 13700637, 'venue': 'Human molecular genetics', 'year': 2018.0, 'author_names': ['Emma M Perkins', 'Yvonne L Clarkson', 'Daumante Suminaite', 'Alastair Robert Lyndon', 'Kohichi Tanaka', 'Jeffrey D Rothstein', 'Paul A Skehel', 'David J A Wyllie', 'Mandy Jackson'], 'n_citations': 13, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '11117322', 'title': ""Microglial phagocytosis induced by fibrillar b amyloid is attenuated by oligomeric b amyloid: implications for Alzheimer's disease"", 'abstract': 'BackgroundReactive microglia are associated with b amyloid (Ab) deposit and clearance in Alzhiemer\'s Disease (AD) Paradoxically, entocranial resident microglia fail to trigger an effective phagocytic response to clear Ab deposits although they mainly exist in an ""activated"" state. Oligomeric Ab (oAb) a recent target in the pathogenesis of AD, can induce more potent neurotoxicity when compared with fibrillar Ab (fAb) However, the role of the different Ab forms in microglial phagocytosis, induction of inflammation and oxidation, and subsequent regulation of phagocytic receptor system, remain unclear.ResultsWe demonstrated that Ab(1 42) fibrils, not Ab(1 42) oligomers, increased the microglial phagocytosis. Intriguingly, the pretreatment of microglia with oAb(1 42) not only attenuated fAb(1 42) triggered classical phagocytic response to fluorescent microspheres but also significantly inhibited phagocytosis of fluorescent labeled fAb(1 42) Compared with the fAb(1 42) treatment, the oAb(1 42) treatment resulted in a rapid and transient increase in interleukin 1b (IL 1b) level and produced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF a) nitric oxide (NO) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and intracellular superoxide anion (SOA) The further results demonstrated that microglial phagocytosis was negatively correlated with inflammatory mediators in this process and that the capacity of phagocytosis in fAb(1 42) induced microglia was decreased by IL 1b, lippolysaccharide (LPS) and tert butyl hydroperoxide (t BHP) The decreased phagocytosis could be relieved by pyrrolidone dithiocarbamate (PDTC) a nuclear factor kB (NF kB) inhibitor, and N acetyl L cysteine (NAC) a free radical scavenger. These results suggest that the oAb impaired phagocytosis is mediated through inflammation and oxidative stress mediated mechanism in microglial cells. Furthermore, oAb(1 42) stimulation reduced the mRNA expression of CD36, integrin b1 (Itgb1) and Ig receptor FcgRIII, and significantly increased that of formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) and scavenger receptor class B1 (SRB1) compared with the basal level. Interestingly, the pre stimulation with oAb(1 42) or the inflammatory and oxidative milieu (IL 1b, LPS or t BHP) significantly downregulated the fAb(1 42) induced mRNA over expression of CD36, CD47 and Itgb1 receptors in microglial cells.ConclusionThese results imply that Ab oligomers induce a potent inflammatory response and subsequently disturb microglial phagocytosis and clearance of Ab fibrils, thereby contributing to an initial neurodegenerative characteristic of AD.

Because of its property to inhibit phosphatase activity, OKA is associated with protein phosphorylation; it is implicated in hyperphosphorylation of tau and in later stages causes Alzhiemer's disease (AD) like pathology. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, pathologically characterized by extracellular amyloid beta (Ab) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) The density of tau tangles in AD pathology is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of serine/threonine protein phosphatases in many processes including apoptosis and neurotoxicity. Although OKA causes neurotoxicity by various pathways, the exact mechanism is still not clear. The activation of major kinases, such as Ser/Thr, MAPK, ERK, PKA, JNK, PKC, CaMKII, Calpain, and GSK3b, in neurons is associated with AD pathology. These kinases, associated with abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, suggest that the cascade of these kinases could exclusively be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The activity of serine/threonine protein phosphatases needs extensive study as these enzymes are potential targets for novel therapeutics with applications in many diseases including cancer, inflammatory diseases, and neurodegeneration.

Affected people show persistent deficits in number processing, which are associated with aberrant brain activation and structure. Reduced gray matter has been reported in DD for the parietal cortex including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) but also the frontal and occipito temporal cortex. Furthermore, dyscalculics show white matter differences for instance in the inferior (ILF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) However, the longitudinal development of these structural differences is unknown. Therefore, our goal was to investigate the developmental trajectory of gray and white matter in children with and without DD. In this longitudinal study, neuropsychological measures and T1 weighted structural images were collected twice with an interval of 4 years from 13 children with DD (8.2 10.4 years) and 10 typically developing (TD) children (8.0 10.4 years) Voxel wise estimation of gray and white matter volumes was assessed using voxel based morphometry for longitudinal data. The present findings reveal for the first time that DD children show persistently reduced gray and white matter volumes over development. Reduced gray matter was found in the bilateral inferior parietal lobes including the IPS, supramarginal gyri, left precuneus, cuneus, right superior occipital gyrus, bilateral inferior and middle temporal gyri, and insula. White matter volumes were reduced in the bilateral ILF and SLF, inferior fronto occipital fasciculus (IFOF) corticospinal tracts, and right anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) Behaviorally, children with DD performed significantly worse in various numerical tasks at baseline and follow up, corroborating persistent deficits in number processing. The present results are in line with the literature showing that children with DD have reduced gray and white matter volumes in the numerical network. Our study further sheds light on the trajectory of brain development, revealing that these known structural differences in the long association fibers and the adjacent regions of the temporal and frontoparietal cortex persist in dyscalculic children from childhood into adolescence.

Crowding like mechanisms are thought to play a key role in numerical perception by determining the sensory mechanisms through which ensembles are perceived. Enhanced visual crowding might hence prevent the normal development of a system involved in segregating and perceiving discrete numbers of items and ultimately the acquisition of more abstract numerical skills. Here, we investigated whether excessive crowding occurs in developmental dyscalculia (DD) a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty in learning the most basic numerical and arithmetical concepts, and whether it is found independently of associated major reading and attentional difficulties. We measured spatial crowding in two groups of adult individuals with DD and control subjects. In separate experiments, participants were asked to discriminate the orientation of a Gabor patch either in isolation or under spatial crowding. Orientation discrimination thresholds were comparable across groups when stimuli were shown in isolation, yet they were much higher for the DD group with respect to the control group when the target was crowded by closely neighbouring flanking gratings. The difficulty in discriminating orientation (as reflected by the combination of accuracy and reaction times) in the DD compared to the control group persisted over several larger target flanker distances. Finally, we found that the degree of such spatial crowding correlated with impairments in mathematical abilities even when controlling for visual attention and reading skills. These results suggest that excessive crowding effects might be a characteristic of DD, independent of other associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Bullet points People with DD have difficulty learning about numbers and arithmetics. Perception of non symbolic number seems to be modulated by visual crowding. Can stronger than normal crowding effects contribute to the origin of DD? We measured crowding with orientation discrimination tasks using Gabor gratings.

Weight loss improves several risk factors for CV diseases, but anti obesity medications and lifestyle interventions have failed to modify primary CV endpoints. This paper reviews bariatric surgery in prevention of CV diseases and CV mortality, and analyzes the possible mechanisms involved. DATA SYNTHESIS In morbidly obese patients bariatric surgery results in stable weight loss and in long term reduction in the prevalence and incidence of obesity related comorbidities; controlled trials have shown superiority of bariatric surgery over medical therapy in inducing significant weight loss and improvement of CV risk factors. Bariatric surgery induces several metabolic improvements (resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus, improvement of lipid metabolism and of insulin resistance, reduction of visceral fat, of subclinical endothelial dysfunction and inflammation) and functional improvements (reduction of hypertension, of sympathetic overactivity, of left and right ventricular hypertrophy) which can explain the protective effect towards CV disease. CONCLUSIONS Reduction of CV diseases is mediated by the pleiotropic effects of weight loss through surgery. Available data do not allow conclusions on the comparative efficacy of different surgical techniques; the choice of the surgical technique for a single patient remains an open question, and it is likely that the degree of prevention of CV diseases depends, among other factors, on the baseline conditions of patients.

Background: Obesity is strongly associated with many types of cancer. Few studies have examined the relationship between bariatric surgery and cancer risk. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2012 with follow up through 2014 using data from a large integrated health insurance and care delivery systems with 5 study sites. The study included 22,198 subjects who had bariatric surgery and 66,427 nonsurgical subjects matched on sex, age, study site, body mass index, and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine incident cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery compared to the matched nonsurgical patients. Results: After a mean follow up of 3.5 years, we identified 2543 incident cancers. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery had a 33% lower hazard of developing any cancer during follow up [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60, 0.74, P 0.001) compared with matched patients with severe obesity who did not undergo bariatric surgery, and results were even stronger when the outcome was restricted to obesity associated cancers (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.51, 0.69, P 0.001) Among the obesity associated cancers, the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44, 0.77, P 0.001) colon cancer (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36, 0.97, P 0.04) endometrial cancer (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.67, P 0.001) and pancreatic cancer (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22, 0.97, P 0.04) was each statistically significantly lower among those who had undergone bariatric surgery compared with matched nonsurgical patients. Conclusions: In this large, multisite cohort of patients with severe obesity, bariatric surgery was associated with a lower risk of incident cancer, particularly obesity associated cancers, such as postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer.

Bariatric surgery (BS) improves metabolism and inflammation in severe obesity and is associated with gut microbiota modifications. Here, we characterised severe obesity associated dysbiosis (ie, MGR, microbiota composition and functional characteristics) and assessed whether BS would rescue these changes. Design Sixty one severely obese subjects, candidates for adjustable gastric banding (AGB, n=20) or Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n=41) were enrolled. Twenty four subjects were followed at 1, 3 and 12 months post BS. Gut microbiota and serum metabolome were analysed using shotgun metagenomics and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS) Confirmation groups were included. Results Low gene richness (LGC) was present in 75% of patients and correlated with increased trunk fat mass and comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, hypertension and severity) Seventy eight metagenomic species were altered with LGC, among which 50% were associated with adverse body composition and metabolic phenotypes. Nine serum metabolites (including glutarate, 3 methoxyphenylacetic acid and L histidine) and functional modules containing protein families involved in their metabolism were strongly associated with low MGR. BS increased MGR 1 year postsurgery, but most RYGB patients remained with low MGR 1 year post BS, despite greater metabolic improvement than AGB patients. Conclusions We identified major gut microbiota alterations in severe obesity, which include decreased MGR and related functional pathways linked with metabolic deteriorations. The lack of full rescue post BS calls for additional strategies to improve the gut microbiota ecosystem and microbiome host interactions in severe obesity.

Objective To assess the association of 3 common types of bariatric surgery compared with nonsurgical treatment with mortality and other clinical outcomes among obese patients. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study in a large Israeli integrated health fund covering 54% of Israeli citizens with less than 1% turnover of members annually. Obese adult patients who underwent bariatric surgery between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, were selected and compared with obese nonsurgical patients matched on age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes, with a final follow up date of December 31, 2015. A total of 33 540 patients were included in this study. Exposures Bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux en Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) or usual care obesity management only (provided by a primary care physician and which may include dietary counseling and behavior modification) Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome, all cause mortality, matched and adjusted for BMI prior to surgery, age, sex, socioeconomic status, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and smoking. Results The study population included 8385 patients who underwent bariatric surgery (median age, 46 [IQR, 37 54] years; 5490 [65.5% women; baseline median BMI, 40.6 [IQR, 38.5 43.7] laparoscopic banding [n 3635] gastric bypass [n 1388] laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [n 3362] and 25 155 nonsurgical matched patients (median age, 46 [IQR, 37 54] years; 16 470 [65.5% women; baseline median BMI, 40.5 [IQR, 37.0 43.5] The availability of follow up data was 100% for all cause mortality. There were 105 deaths (1.3% among surgical patients during a median follow up of 4.3 (IQR, 2.8 6.6) years (including 61 [1.7% who underwent laparoscopic banding, 18 [1.3% gastric bypass, and 26 [0.8% sleeve gastrectomy) and 583 deaths (2.3% among nonsurgical patients during a median follow up of 4.0 (IQR, 2.6 6.2) years. The absolute difference was 2.51 (95% CI, 1.86 3.15) fewer deaths/1000 person years in the surgical vs nonsurgical group. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality among nonsurgical vs surgical patients were 2.02 (95% CI, 1.63 2.52) for the entire study population; by surgical type, HRs were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.50 2.69) for laparoscopic banding, 2.65 (95% CI, 1.55 4.52) for gastric bypass, and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.02 2.51) for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Conclusions and Relevance Among obese patients in a large integrated health fund in Israel, bariatric surgery using laparoscopic banding, gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, compared with usual care nonsurgical obesity management, was associated with lower all cause mortality over a median follow up of approximately 4.5 years.

METHODS We reviewed data from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database, and Nationwide Inpatient Sample. In addition, data from industry and outpatient centers were used to estimate outpatient center activity. Data from 2018 were compared mainly with data from the previous 2 years. RESULTS Compared with 2017, the total number of metabolic and bariatric procedures performed in 2018 increased from approximately 228,000 to 252,000. The sleeve gastrectomy continues to be the most common procedure. The gastric bypass procedure trend remained relatively stable and the gastric band procedure trend continued to decline. The percentage of revision procedures and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch procedures increased slightly. Finally, intragastric balloons placement continues as a significant contributor to the cumulative total number of procedures performed but declined from the previous year.

On the other hand, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) have contributed to the popularization of radio navigation in civilian applications. These factors had a direct impact on the development and dissemination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) In the initial period, the UAVs were used mainly for the army needs. This results also from the legal aspects of the UAV use in the airspace. Currently, commercial UAVs for civilian applications, such as image recognition, monitoring, transport, etc. are presented increasingly. Generally, the GNSS system accuracy for the UAV positioning during a flight is enough. However, the GNSS use for automatic takeoff and landing may be insufficient. The extensive, ground based navigation support systems used at airports by manned aircraft testify to these. In the UAV case, such systems are not used due to their complexity and price. For this reason, the novel dedicated take off and landing systems are developed. The proposal of the autonomous landing system, which is based on the Doppler effect, was presented in 2017. In this case, the square based beacon configuration was analyzed. This paper shows the influence of various beacon configurations in the Doppler based landing system on the positioning error during the UAV landing approach. http:/www.transnav.eu the International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation Volume 13', 'corpus_id': 201136141, 'venue': '', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Jan M Kelner', 'Cezary Ziolkowski'], 'n_citations': 2, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '214543183', 'title': 'Unmanned Aerial System Inspection of Instrument Landing System Radio Signals', 'abstract': 'This study investigates the use of a unmanned aerial system (UAS) for instrument landing system (ILS) signal inspection.

Aircraft operators also require efficiency gains via approaches with the lowest possible minima and the significant safety benefits of vertical guidance. GNSS based services can meet these goals and have already provided significant safety and efficiency benefits to many aircraft operators worldwide (USA, and EU members mainly) Following this trend, Ukraine started GNSS implementation in aviation as well. Paper [1] addresses main aspects of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) implementation in Ukraine. According the requirements and methodology provided in the Manual on Testing of Radio Navigation Aids [2,3] GNSS monitoring and testing should be performed, to confirm the ability of GNSS signals to support flight procedures in accordance with Annex 10 [4] The safe operation of an aircraft landing based on GNSS signals depends on the performance of navigation receiver and accuracy of its coordinates determination, which depends on the accuracy of atmospheric parameters estimation [5] and surrounding electromagnetic environment [4] Therefore, an important scientific and technical problem is monitoring and control of the radionavigation field and electromagnetic environment in the approach and landing area in order to increase the safety of aircrafts using GNSS technology [6 9] Currently, multichannel scanning receivers are used for radio monitoring. They perform constant automatic control and radio signals search at predetermined frequencies. It should be noted that the efficiency of radio monitoring depends not only on the availability of expensive equipment (frequency meters, field indicators, spectrum analyzers, broadband antennas, band filters, low noise antenna amplifiers, high frequency cables with small losses) proper installation, but also on the methods of data analysis, qualification and experience of radio operators.

To Melanie, who had forgotten her travelling clock who had forgotten everything the hands might have stood anywhere By the cover of Le Soleil, the Orleanist morning paper, it was 24 July 1913. Louis Philippe Robert, duc d'Orleans, was the current Pretender. Certain quarters of Paris raved under the heat of Sirius Melanie l'Heuremaudit was driven away down the rue La Fayette in a noisy auto taxi. Historical stresses underlying much twentieth century fiction are to be found in Chapter 14 of Thomas Pynchon's V. not least in the strange chronology described in its opening, quoted above, and echoed in Melanie's second name, which translates as 'the accursed hour'[1] Typically of Pynchon's fiction, those clocks seem odd but have a firm historical basis. In A la recherche du temps perdu, Proust also refers to the survival of mid European time, and even the Eastern calendar, into the early decades of the twentieth century. Within France, to help tardy travellers catch their trains, station clocks in 1913 still kept 'l'heure de la gare' five minutes slower, as Pynchon suggests, than the 'Paris time' shown on all the capital's other clocks. Belgian trains, on the other hand, still ran exactly on Brussels time, which differed from that of Paris in the early years of the century. Melanie's loss of her travelling clock at least saves her the irritation of having to reset it in the course of her journey from Belgium, a task often necessary for railway travellers in the nineteenth century and, as Pynchon shows, into the early part of the twentieth, at least on the Continent. Travelling clocks of a different sort had already ended this problem within Britain. Railway companies in the mid nineteenth century sent officials with accurate chronometers up and down the country, resetting station clocks to eliminate local times in favour of a national standard, Railway Time, established more or less throughout the land by 1848. It was further institutionalized as part of the new global standards set up by the International Meridian Conference of 1884, which answered the needs of travel, shipping, telegraphy, and other commercial interests by placing the Prime Meridian at Greenwich Observatory, also established as the centre of a world wide system of time zones and Mean Time. Contemporary public interest in the new arrangements is evident in Arthur Wing Pinero's The Magistrate, first performed the year after the Conference: when asked about the time, its hero cheerfully replies 'Hurray! Just half past ten. Greenwich mean, eh Guv? Ulysses (1922) shows Bloom pondering in 1904 the technology through which the new standard time was disseminated throughout the British Isles when he notices a Dublin time signal 'that falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink'[2] Ireland, however, did not fully accept Greenwich Mean Time until 1916, and other countries were similarly tardy, France particularly. For patriotic reasons, France had always favoured Paris over Greenwich as the location of the Prime Meridian, and was consequently dilatory and eventually devious in implementing the new arrangements. GMT was legally accepted as the time of France in 1896, but it was not until fifteen years later that much was done to implement it, and even then only by referring to it as 'Paris time minus nine minutes and twenty one seconds' hence that nine minute difference from Brussels, working on GMT since 1892, which Pynchon identifies.[3] Indeed, France's official time continued to be defined in this way until 1978, when it moved to Co ordinated Universal Time, a measure (now generally accepted as the world standard at the end of the twentieth century) originally owing less to British efforts than to further conferences on time initiated by the French in Paris in 1912 and 1913."", 'corpus_id': 96477296, 'venue': '', 'year': 2000.0, 'author_names': ['Randall Stevenson'], 'n_citations': 7, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '109274421', 'title': 'The social dimension of the urban village: A comparison of models for sustainable urban development', 'abstract': ""The paper explores the social dimension of the urban village debate, by examining recent ideas on the desirable social characteristics of sustainable urban development.

Intrigued by variability in arm taper angle between different octopus species, we explored the utility of designing soft actuators exhibiting a distinctive conical geometry, compared with more traditional cylindrical forms. We find that these octopus inspired conical shaped actuators exhibit a wide range of bending curvatures that can be tuned by simply altering their taper angle and they also demonstrate greater flexibility compared with their cylindrical counterparts. The taper angle and bending curvature are inversely related, whereas taper angle and applied bending force are directly related. To further expand the functionality of our soft actuators, we incorporated vacuum actuated suckers into the actuators for the production of a fully integrated octopus arm inspired gripper. Notably, our results reveal that because of their enhanced flexibility, these tapered actuators with suckers have better gripping power than their cylindrical shaped counterparts and require significantly larger forces to be detached from both flat and curved surfaces. Finally, we show that by choosing appropriate taper angles, our tapered actuators with suckers can grip, move, and place a remarkably wide range of objects with flat, nonplanar, smooth, or rough surfaces, as well as retrieve objects through narrow openings.

As the GATT evolved over time and morphed into the World Trade Organization in 1993, both goals have largely been achieved. The WTO presides over a rule based trading system based on norms that are almost universally accepted and respected by its 163 members. Tariffs today are below 5 percent on most trade, and zero for a very large share of imports. Despite its manifest success, the WTO is widely regarded as suffering from a deep malaise. The main reason is that the latest WTO negotiation, the Doha Round, has staggered between failures, flops, and false dawns since it was launched in 2001. But the Doha logjam has not inhibited tariff liberalization far from it. During the last 15 years, most WTO members have massively lowered barriers to trade, investment, and services bilaterally, regionally, and unilaterally indeed, everywhere except through the WTO. For today's offshoring linked international commerce, the trade rules that matter are less about tariffs and more about protection of investments and intellectual property, along with legal and regulatory steps to assure that the two way flows of goods, services, investment, and people will not be impeded. It's possible to imagine a hypothetical WTO that would incorporate these rules. But the most likely outcome for the future governance of international trade is a two pillar structure in which the WTO continues to govern with its 1994 era rules while the new rules for international production networks are set by a decentralized process of sometimes overlapping and inconsistent mega regional agreements."", 'corpus_id': 155211058, 'venue': '', 'year': 2016.0, 'author_names': ['Richard E Baldwin'], 'n_citations': 83, 'n_key_citations': 5, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '158615584', 'title': ""Recalcitrant spoiler?

In this article, however, I contest this assessment by arguing that the emerging powers were never solely, nor most importantly, merely an economic phenomenon. Instead, I show that emerging powers specifically Brazil, India and China have become an important political force in the global trading system and had a profound and lasting impact on the World Trade Organization (WTO) Contrary to the widespread assumption that these countries are too diverse to ally, I argue that the emerging powers displayed a remarkable degree of unity and cooperation, working in close concert to successfully challenge the dominance of the US and other established powers.

First, the turn to plurilateralism is timely and promises to be welfare enhancing as trade liberalization evolves from negative integration through tariff cuts to positive integration through rule convergence. Plurilateralism is often better suited to govern rule convergence. The article builds on the theory of club goods to underpin this claim.

Besides that it does not, as a rule, go beyond multilateral rules of the regulation of international trade. This allows us to define it as a legitimate one. The author estimates the probability of the execution of the approved program of the negotiations of the Doha round which aims at further liberalization of agricultural and non agricultural trade as well as services. It is stated that the deadlock situation during the negotiations forced the members of the WTO to step back from the batch method of decision making and the principle ""everything is compulsory for all"" This opened the way for the progress in reduction of trade barriers with the help of agreements between limited number of the participants (selective liberalization) and preferential regional trade agreements of the new type ""liberalization for those who care"" A fear is expressed that the current trade conflict between the US and China may lead to the opening of wide scale trade war between the two countries and may give an impetus for the outbreak of similar ""wars"" between other participants in the world trade and, at worst, for the collapse of the multilateral trading system that has been built during the past seventy years. In this case, international rules, though not perfect and outdated, might be substituted by chaos and anarchy which may result in the aggravation of problems of the world development. Further on, the author pays attention to the fact that the level of tariff protection in Russia somewhat decreased after the WTO accession. Still, the membership in this organization does not create any serious problems for most sectors and branches of the national economy. It is a matter of fact that the level of protectionism in the Russian Federation is higher than in the developed countries but lower than in the leading developing economies (China, India, Brazil) The author states that strengthening of protectionist elements in the trade policy will be a difficult task for the Russian government. The main reason is that the principal functions of the regulation of the foreign trade have been recently subdued rom the national government to the Eurasian Economic Commission. It is concluded that the possible destruction of the established international order in trade relations will not bring benefit for the domestic economy which is, to a great extent, dependent from foreign markets both as producer and as consumer.

The practice of herbal medicine basically depends on folklore and by experiences of people over a long period of time. However, very little research especially in the area of basic science has been conducted in a systematic manner. Medicinal plants with a long history of safe and effective use are likely to have a pharmaceutical effect. The use of plants in traditional medicine can be explained by physiologically active phytochemical compounds of a species and also by its ascribed meaning in a culture. A Plants produce a great diversity of substances that could be of therapeutic significance in many areas of medicine. However, the chemical nature of plant compounds present naturally as such and in extract, is puzzling. It is important to know constituents of plant extracts and their relative importance in their therapeutic value. The alkaloids and other compounds are characterized and tested for their medicinal value from these plants which include not only the unexplored tribal plants but also the spices, condiments and vegetables which are already in use. In last decade, there is a renewed interest in the development of herbal drugs underlined by the understanding of mechanism of action rather than based on faith and folk, as it happened in past. Several aspects on integrated approaches of drug development from herbs have explored many potential lead phytochemicals. Nonetheless, even the limited number of mechanistic experiments reveals that numerous mechanisms are likely involved in the various actions of even a single herbal medicine. It will be the elucidation of such mechanisms that will provide the scientific basis for establishing the efficacy and safety of not only Chinese and Indian herbal medicines but all forms of medicinal botanicals.', 'corpus_id': 53953256, 'venue': '', 'year': 2011.0, 'author_names': ['Lazar Mathew and S Babu'], 'n_citations': 13, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '25803594', 'title': 'Spasmolytic Mechanism of Aqueous Licorice Extract on Oxytocin Induced Uterine Contraction through Inhibiting the Phosphorylation of Heat Shock Protein 27', 'abstract': 'Licorice derived from the roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Fabaceae) is one of the most widely used traditional herbal medicines in China. It has been reported to possess significant analgesic activity for treating spastic pain. The aim of this study is to investigate the spasmolytic molecular mechanism of licorice on oxytocin induced uterine contractions and predict the relevant bioactive constituents in the aqueous extract. The aqueous extraction from licorice inhibited the amplitude and frequency of uterine contraction in a concentration dependent manner. A morphological examination showed that myometrial smooth muscle cells of oxytocin stimulated group were oval shaped and arranged irregularly, while those with a single centrally located nucleus of control and licorice treated groups were fusiform and arranged orderly. The percentage of phosphorylation of HSP27 at Ser 15 residue increased up to 50.33% at 60 min after oxytocin stimulation. Furthermore, this increase was significantly suppressed by licorice treatment at the concentration of 0.2 and 0.4 mg/mL. Colocalization between HSP27 and a SMA was observed in the myometrial tissues, especially along the actin bundles in the oxytocin stimulated group. On the contrary, the colocalization was no longer shown after treatment with licorice. Additionally, employing ChemGPS NP provided support for a preliminary assignment of liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin as protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors in addition to liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritin and isoliquiritin as MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) inhibitors. These assigned compounds were docked with corresponding crystal structures of respective proteins with negative and low binding energy, which indicated a high affinity and tight binding capacity for the active site of the kinases. These results suggest that licorice exerts its spasmolytic effect through inhibiting the phosphorylation of HSP27 to alter the interaction between HSP27 and actin.

These disorders are caused by severe constriction of the bronchial tree, and ephedrine simply relaxes bronchial muscle to improve respiration. Although Western medicine relied on intravenous epinephrine (adrenaline) to treat severe asthma, pharmaceutical firms recognized the value of developing an oral medication for bronchial congestion. By 1935, several ephedrine analogues were synthesized, some of which remain in use as nasal decongestants (e.g. pseudoephedrine) The amphetamines were developed as part of this effort. In fact, the first synthetic ephedrine analogue was a mixture of d and l amphetamine. Marketed in 1932 as a decongestant, these amphetamine isomers were the active ingredient in the popular Benzedrine inhaler, which quickly became known for its stimulant properties. The addition of a second methyl group created an even more potent amphetamine variant, methamphetamine, sold as Methedrine. After the amphetamines became available in tablet form, they were used to treat both narcolepsy, a condition characterized by sleep attacks, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) an apparent paradoxical effect (see below) Amphetamine tablets also were used as appetite suppressants; d amphetamine was marketed for this purpose as Dexedrine in 1945, but the anorexiant effect faded rapidly', 'corpus_id': 15373062, 'venue': '', 'year': 2003.0, 'author_names': ['George V Rebec'], 'n_citations': 8, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}]"

Owing to globalization and communication development, the role of the English language is changing; thus, there is need to change the policies and ideologies surrounding English instruction, particularly when English functions as a lingua franca. In Pakistan, the role of the English language is linked with language ideology due to the country's British colonial background. The society is still divided on the role of English and the colonial mindset persists in language ideology and instructional practices. By contrast, English is taught as a foreign language in China because it is not a postcolonial language. While the English language fulfils people's different communication needs, there is a concern that people might lose their own identity if English is viewed as more important than their own mother tongue. Therefore, this paper summarizes how the debate related to English language teaching is linked to various language ideologies. Finally, this paper argues for the importance of viewing English language teaching through a multilingual perspective, and contextualizing language policies to readdress learners' different needs and goals of English learning."", 'corpus_id': 150797809, 'venue': 'Asia Pacific Journal of Education', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Sham Haidar', 'Fan Fang'], 'n_citations': 14, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '149473468', 'title': 'Utopianism, transindividuation, and foreign language education in the Japanese university', 'abstract': ""Abstract This article examines the current state of foreign language education in Japanese universities as illustrative of the troubling conditions facing the liberal arts (i.e. the transformative arts) in a globalized neoliberal milieu. The utopian ideal in education has always insinuated, at the least, a pedagogy that inspires personal agency, creative investment, challenge to power and social change. This imagining of incalculable futures, however, has been undermined by the seemingly inevitable and confluent forces of a networked world, represented most forcefully by the socioeconomic reductionism of neoliberal globalism. In the context of contemporary Japanese higher education, these forces are joined by Japan's uniquely ambivalent relationship with the 'outside' world, and manifested in the rigid conceptualizations that motivate deeply problematic government and institutional initiatives for the 'globalization' of higher education. Within the frame of Bernard Stiegler's work on transindividuation (psychosocial transformation) this article critiques these influential practices as fundamentally antithetical to the challenge of engaging Japanese learners of foreign languages in sustainable 'economies of contribution' economies which foster critical engagement and which open paths to transindividuation. The article concludes by arguing for a radical reimagining of the landscape of foreign language pedagogy in Japan and for a repositioning of learners from 'short circuited' semiotic consumers to 'long circuited' semiosic participants."", 'corpus_id': 149473468, 'venue': '', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['David Kennedy'], 'n_citations': 2, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '153856382', 'title': 'Globalization and Forces for Change in Higher Education', 'abstract': 'For higher education, globalization implies the broad social, economic, and technological forces that shape the realities of the 21st century.

First, the further development of science education as an international research domain is critically analyzed.

In particular, languages education needs to be developed on the basis of an understanding of the interplay of all the languages and cultures available in local contexts. In addition, it needs to be developed in such a way that students, as language users and language learners, become effective mediators of meanings across multiple languages, cultures and semiotic systems, thereby undergoing a process of personal transformation. We suggest that the need for such development should urge language planners, policy makers and educators to adopt a relational perspective on language and languages that both respects and accounts for different world views and which has important implications for curriculum, pedagogy, assessment and evaluation.

In the 1990s, neoliberalism dominated the sociopolitical landscape of most Latin American countries. At the time, language policies in Uruguay sought to make English the foreign language par excellence, to the detriment of other languages such as French and Italian. The discourse of neoliberal language policies related the expansion of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) to a new global order that called for an instrumental language to help Uruguay become ""a first world country,"" and English was the key to open doors to globalization. During the first decade of the 21st century, however, the sociopolitical landscape of Uruguay shifted toward a left wing ideology. Even though policies continued to promote EFL, they struggled to re define its political meaning. As English was now seen as a symbol of imperialism (Phillipson, 1992) and colonialism (Pennycook, 1994, 1998, 2000) the only way for Uruguayan children to be critical of its hegemonic power was to learn the language through a pedagogy of empowerment. In this paper, I argue that the transition from neoliberal to left wing ideology in central government brought about a political struggle (Koselleck, 1993, 2002) in which each ideology fought to (re)define EFL in its own terms. I will map this political struggle to define EFL in Uruguay by analyzing three official EFL related documents written by policy makers and other stakeholders in the 1990s and 2000s, which represent the voices of neoliberal and left wing policy makers, respectively.', 'corpus_id': 141698020, 'venue': '', 'year': 2015.0, 'author_names': ['German Canale'], 'n_citations': 8, 'n_key_citations': 1, 'score': 0}]"

Schistosomiasis Japonica is a serious threat to human health in some lakes of China. METHODS We analyzed the potential associations between the hub gene (PTEN, mTOR, AKT1 and AKT2) polymorphisms of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and S. japonica risk, including infection risk, as well as immunological hepatic fibrosis risk. An immune database named Database of Immune Cell Expression, Expression quantitative trait loci and Epigenomics (DICE) was used to analyze the expression profiles of the hub genes in 15 types of immune cells. RESULTS Of them, two SNPs rs2295080 (mTOR) and rs7254617 (AKT2) were found associated with the risk of infection and fibrosis. We also performed a multivariant Cox regression analysis and found that HBV infection may increase hepatic fibrosis in chronic schistosomiasis patients, instead of genetic polymorphisms on PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway or any other factors. We also found the expressions of mTOR (RICTOR) and AKT2 in T cells were higher than those in monocyte cells. And, the expressions of PTEN, mTOR (RICTOR) and AKT1 reduced both in activated CD4 T cells and activated CD8 T cells.

The current study aimed to unravel the inhibitory effects of Ginsenoside Rg3 (G Rg3) on inflammation mediated hepatic autophagy to curb hepatic fibrosis caused by thioacetamide (TAA) induced subacute and chronic hepatic injury. TAA is mainly metabolized in the liver to cause liver dysfunction. After intraperitoneal injection of TAA for 4 or 10 weeks (TAA chronic mouse models) severe inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis occurred in the liver. Treatment with G Rg3 alleviated hepatic pathological changes and reversed hepatic fibrosis in the TAA chronic models with decreased deposition of collagen fibers, reduced expression of HSCs activation marker (a SMA) and reduced secretion of profibrogenic factors (TGF b1) G Rg3 decreased expressions of autophagy related proteins in mice of TAA chronic models. Notably, G Rg3 inhibited the survival of activated rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC T6) but had no cytotoxicity on human hepatocytes (L02 cell lines) G Rg3 dose dependently inhibited autophagy in vitro with less expression of p62 and fewer LC3a transformation into LC3b in inflammatory inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced rat HSC T6 cells. Furthermore, G Rg3 enhanced the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in vivo and in vitro.

It is characterized by portal hypertension, but the manifestations, management, and outcome vary in children and adults. To raise awareness of medical staff, we have comprehensively compared the clinical features of congenital hepatic fibrosis between children and adults. Methods We retrospectively enrolled all patients diagnosed with congenital hepatic fibrosis at the Huashan Hospital from August 2015 to August 2017 and analyzed their familial, clinical, laboratory, imaging, treatment, and follow up data in detail. In addition, we reviewed cases with congenital hepatic fibrosis reported in the past 20 years in China and analyzed them according to the patients' age. Results A total of eight patients were diagnosed with congenital hepatic fibrosis in the study, including four children and four adults. The onset age of the children, who suffered from severe complications of portal hypertension and needed liver transplantation, ranged from 1 to 15 years old. The disorder developed in adults aged 26 to 60 years old. Three adults complained of recurrent abnormal liver function at the onset of illness, and they mainly received conservative treatments. The literature review included 30 children and 33 adults. In comparison, hepatomegaly was more common in children than in adults (57% vs. 21% p 0.004) Malformation of kidneys and bile duct abnormalities were common, and multisystem involvement included eyes, other digestive organs, and genital and central nervous systems. Conclusions Serious complications of portal hypertension developed in children requiring liver transplantation, while adults often had mild to moderate liver injuries upon onset. Adults with CHF varied a lot in clinical manifestations. Multiorgan involvement and unusual course are helpful to make a diagnosis.

Ligustrazine or/and paeonol significantly improve the pathological changes in liver tissue induced by CCl4, however, they reduced the levels of liver and fibrosis markers in tissue and serum. ROS, NOX1 and NOX2 were significantly increased and GSH was decreased in HSC, with the intervention of Ligustrazine or/and paeonol. We further found that Ligustrazine or/and paeonol can effectively inhibit liver inflammation in vivo. The expression of TNF a, IL 6 and IL 8 was upregulated in HSC. Moreover, Ligustrazine or/and paeonol promotes apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of HSC. Additionally, the inhibiting effects of the drug on collagen deposition was due to the interference with the expression of signaling pathway related proteins and genes such as, MMPS, TGF b, PDGF and BMP 2 in HSC.

Nowadays, in Italy green roof technology is still uncommon, because of high installation cost that drives the choice towards more traditional performing solutions, such as cool roofs (CRs) Thus, a thorough valuation of green roofs benefits in urban contexts is required to encourage their diffusion. This paper aims to valuate private and social costs and benefits generated by extensive green roofs (EGRs) compared with cool roofs in three Italian cities: Trieste, Ancona and Palermo. These contexts are characterized by different Mediterranean climate conditions (North, Centre and South Italy) moreover, residential areas overlooking industrial settlements take place in each of them, so it is possible to hypothesize a potential enhancement of landscape value in these properties, allowing to compare aesthetic benefits due to green roofs upon industrial buildings. The study has been based on literature review and on simulation of energy performances of EGR and CR alternatively considered as refurbishment solution for a reference industrial building taking place in each industrial settlement. For the social side, the externalities deriving from EGRs and CRs, such as aesthetic enhancement, biodiversity preservation and natural habitat provision, carbon reduction, air quality improvement, stormwater control, have been monetized according to available data for the cases of study. The analysis demonstrates that a private investor has a poor convenience to implement EGR rather than CR. On the other, a positive Net Present Value (NPV) derives from social cost benefit analysis comparing EGR and CR, due to the EGR positive externalities. The valuation of the positive externalities let the calculation of economic incentives amount to promote the diffusion of green roofs in the Mediterranean area. On this basis, an annual reduction of local property tax has been considered as incentive form. Further, a sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation of both private and social benefits evaluation has been performed for each of three case studies. This technique properly evaluates the final effects on private investments in the presence of random unpredictable variables, depending either on climate conditions or on market observation, that influence their economic affordability.

Numerous protocols use fetal bovine serum, which contains poorly defined factors to induce DE formation. Here, we compared Wnt and BMP in their ability to cooperate with Activin signaling to promote DE formation in a chemically defined medium. Varying concentrations of WNT3A, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3 inhibitors CHIR99021 and 6 bromoindirubin 3' oxime (BIO) and BMP4 could independently co operate with Activin to effectively induce DE formation even in the absence of serum. Overall, CHIR99021 is favored due to its cost effectiveness. Surprisingly, WNT3A was ineffective in suppressing E CADHERIN/CDH1 and pluripotency factor gene expression unlike GSK 3 inhibitors or BMP4.

The main objective of this study is to understand the role of IR signaling in pluripotency and lineage development. Methods To explore the role of IR signaling, we generated IR knock out (IRKO) mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) from E14.5 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of global IRKO mice using a cocktail of four reprogramming factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc. We performed pluripotency characterization and directed the differentiation of control and IRKO iPSCs into neural progenitors (ectoderm) adipocyte progenitors (mesoderm) and pancreatic beta like cells (endoderm) We mechanistically confirmed these findings via phosphoproteomics analyses of control and IRKO iPSCs. Results Interestingly, expression of pluripotency markers including Klf4, Lin28a, Tbx3, and cMyc were upregulated, while abundance of Oct4 and Nanog were enhanced by 4 fold and 3 fold, respectively, in IRKO iPSCs. Analyses of signaling pathways demonstrated downregulation of phospho STAT3, p mTor and p Erk and an increase in the total mTor and Erk proteins in IRKO iPSCs in the basal unstimulated state. Stimulation with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) showed a ~33% decrease of phospho ERK in IRKO iPSCs. On the contrary, Erk phosphorylation was increased during in vitro spontaneous differentiation of iPSCs lacking IRs. Lineage specific directed differentiation of the iPSCs revealed that cells lacking IR showed enhanced expression of neuronal lineage markers (Pax6, Tubb3, Ascl1 and Oligo2) while exhibiting a decrease in adipocyte (Fas, Acc, Pparg, Fabp4, C/ebpa, and Fsp27) and pancreatic beta cell markers (Ngn3, Isl1, and Sox9) Further molecular characterization by phosphoproteomics confirmed the novel IR mediated regulation of the global pluripotency network including several key proteins involved in diverse aspects of growth and embryonic development.

Worldwide, SARS CoV 2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS CoV 2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1 S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2) IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS CoV 2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.', 'corpus_id': 218561649, 'venue': '', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Chandrika Bhattacharyya', 'Chitrarpita Das', 'Arnab Ghosh', 'Animesh K Singh', 'Souvik Mukherjee', 'Partha P Majumder', 'Analabha Basu', 'Nidhan K Biswas'], 'n_citations': 103, 'n_key_citations': 5, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '216642732', 'title': 'Interim Analysis of Pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) and the SARS CoV 2 virus in Latin America and the Caribbean: Morbidity, Mortality and Molecular Testing Trends in the Region', 'abstract': 'Background: The relentless advance of the SARS CoV 2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden on countries, regardless of their socio economic conditions.

Individuals who collect art and who share the growing interest in art as an investment question whether art is a good investment particularly when art is illiquid and the ability to convert an art investment into cash expeditiously is limited. Anything that can be said about art as an investment obviously applies only to genuine art and not fakes or forgeries. Investors need to be able to find out what is authentic and what is not. Art prices may be quite unpredictable, and investment horizons may run for decades and art often ends up as part of an estate. Past performance in art investing is no indicator of future results. At the same time statistics suggest that discerning investors might at least want to give some thought to adding art to their portfolios. The next issue is whether art serves any function in a portfolio. Sales at the major auction houses are setting record prices for art against the backdrop of major recession. Studies indicate that art values tend to hold up well during periods of economic difficulty and that art indices outperform major stock indices during times of war. Art could therefore be a balancing or stabilizing asset. This study considers whether investing in a fine art at the correct price could diversify a portfolio risk and stabilize the volatility of one's portfolio and position one's art collection for upside appreciation. Since investment in art is modeled with due regard to the peculiarities of artistic work and value created activities, it follows that the construction of earnings functions and models of career choice in this area will also need to account for the risk and return function.

The caluclations were made using three approaches according time classification monthly, semi annual and annual analysis. The data was sorted in two sets total sales and sales excluding top 1.5 per cent of outliers. Based on the price indices obtained, I concluded that fine art photography on total sales results with an average of 7 per cent for semi annual period and 10.78 per cent for annual period (in real terms, U.S. dollars) To test the 'Masterpiece effect' I computed rate of return on top 1.5 per cent of highly priced artoworks, compared it to the rate on rest of photographs and concluded the presence of anomaly on this market. The rate of return as well as the rate of market volatility were high (16.07 per cent and 24.08 per cent relatively) which implied that expensive artworks are considered to be financially beneficial, but risky assets for funds allocation. During the 2002 2007, I detected boom period when art prices were growing steadily and sufficiently, which explained the increased attention to fine art photography as a form of investment. To determine whether photography is a relevant sphere to invest in or not, I compared the results to the financial market, represented by the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index.

The manual evaluation of these papers takes a lot of effort and time of the evaluators hence resulting in a time consuming process. The solution to grade a large number of papers effectively within a stipulated time is to let the machine do the grading. The automated grading system will not only reduce the time of evaluation but comparing it with human scores will also make the score more realistic. The project aim is to develop a system which grades an essay or a paper without any manual involvement. When an essay is loaded into the proposed grading system, the system accepts the essay given as the input and grades it using deep learning techniques and its layers such as LSTM and dense layers. This proposed system is useful while grading papers in smart schools and educational institutions.', 'corpus_id': 230120824, 'venue': '', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Mr P V Hari Prasad', 'G Himaja', 'Ch Abhigna', 'Keerthi Saroja', 'K Venkatesh'], 'n_citations': 0, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '230630229', 'title': 'An Automated Essay Grading Framework Based on Neural Networks (Dept.E)', 'abstract': ""This paper presents a proposed framework depending on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that enhances the process of assessing student's essays in order to save the line and cost of manual scoring of these essays.

The grading process is carried out by capturing the fruit image using digital camera and this image is interpreted using image various processing techniques. Color is very prominent feature for recognizing defect and ripeness of the fruit. The major objective is to check the fruit quality with high speed for analyzing maximum number of fruits in least amount of time. The conventional process of fruit quality assessment needs new tools deciding the quality of fruit. This system performs color features and size of fruit and captures the fruit side view image.

The divide and grade is an automated grading approach that uses clustering to assign answers into sets each of which is supposed to be sufficiently similar to receive the same grade.

Many current clustering methods are known to suffer from the presence of anomalies, answers that are deviated from the modes of model answers or common misconceptions. The freedom afforded to the composition of answers often lead to these anomalies, and in particular, contextual anomalous answers that are marginally correct or wrong. This paper proposes an evolutionary clustering method for the divide and conquer approach. The method is coupled with anomalous answer recognition based on an entropy formulation of the cluster membership of answers for rectifying misclustered answers.

crises,such as SARS,Bird Flu,and Wenchuan Earthquake,is exerting strong pressures on the government to develop a humane society.Emergency materials are always in great demand when emergency events occur.Most companies have been reserving an extra production capacity as part of contingency plan for emergency events.However,the ordinary capacity reserve can hardly meet the sudden demand caused by an unanticipated public crisis.China has been experiencing an increasing number of emergency events recently.The Chinese government has mandated that governmental institutions at all levels establish production capacity reserves and have flexible production capacity that can be quickly expanded.In other words,companies are required to maintain a certain capacity level for producing emergency materials during the routine operation according to governmental regulations.Our literature review shows that production capacity reserves in a supply chain can improve profit for a company if the market demand is suddenly increased and its supply chains are stable.Most suppliers are willing to build production capacity reserve if other supply chain partners are willing to share costs and risks.However,companies may risk losing customers if product price is required to include additional costs caused by the excessive production capacity reserve.Companies are more willing to work with the government to increase their production reserves according to an emergency plan.The existing literature primarily centers on the study of production capacity reserve among companies,rather than between the government and companies.This paper tries to address this issue by conducting a quantitative analysis of planned emergency funds from the perspectives of both the government and companies.The objective of this study is to propose an emergency fund planning model for companies to meet the government's mandate of reserving production capacity for emergency events.We make a few assumptions before proposing the emergency fund planning model.The first assumption is that the government,at all levels,owns physical reserves to meet the initial demand of emergency materials,and companies have the same contingency reserves for unanticipated changes in market demand.The second assumption is that both the government and companies have the intention of collaborating with each other to cope with the ongoing demand of emergency materials.In the course of building production capacity reserves,both entities will make decisions according to the same mathematical model of budget constraint function and the Douglas utility function.The third assumption is that response to the governmental policy of production capacity reserves(i.e.,planed emergency funds) and utility function are identical for all companies that produce the same materials.In this paper,we first discuss problems associated with the mismatch of emergency funds caused by difficult coordination of a large number of companies.The larger the number of companies producing the same materials,the more difficult the coordination between governments and companies in producing capacity reserves will be.Secondly,the government's planned emergency fund is limited if the relationship between the government and companies are in the master slave mode.On the other hand,companies should keep their planned emergency capacities in accordance with the government's planned emergency funds if the government needs to rely on the contribution of companies.Thirdly,the master slave mode(government to company) is more appropriate for matching emergency fund than the peer to peer form(company to company) or the alternative master slave mode(company to government).Finally,quantitative evidence is provided to illustrate the rationality of the proposed method.Our analysis results indicate that the government and companies should keep their emergency funds in proportion to production capacity reserves.The implementation of production capacity reserves does not merely rely on the amounts of funds provided by the government or enterprises.Also,the appropriate arrangement of the emergency funds is subject to the number of companies that produce homogeneous emergency materials.The government should formulate investment strategies to guide enterprises in bearing social responsibility and easing the shortage of emergency funds.This guidance can help build production capacity reserves in order to improve the security level of emergency materials in a region.In reality not all companies are willing to bear social responsibility when emergency events occur.Perhaps,companies' utility function and their response to the government policy are not identical.Despite these limitations,analytic methods and research findings in this paper have practical implications and make contributions to the existing literature."", 'corpus_id': 156272460, 'venue': 'IEEM 2011', 'year':

Afterwards, a similarity measure is defined based on the filtered DSA residues after the binary opening operation. Considering the possible variations of the constructed DSA, several different structuring elements are used during the binary morphological filtering. And a score level fusion is performed afterwards to obtain a robust similarity. By comparing the similarities between the test image and various template classes, the target label is determined to be the one with the maximum similarity. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) dataset and compared with several state of the art SAR target recognition methods.', 'corpus_id': 57759084, 'venue': 'Comput.

To address the issue, a novel early fault detection strategy based on an enhanced scale morphological hat product filtering (ESMHPF) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, motivated by the existing morphology theory, the concept of morphology hat product operation (MHPO) is presented to handle the collected weak fault signal, which can extract efficiently periodic impulse characteristics closely linked to the bearing defects. Subsequently, diagonal slice spectra (DSS) are incorporated into morphological analysis, which can achieve the efficacy of noise rejection and feature enhancement. Ultimately, the optimal scale morphological filtering results are determined by using a sensitive index termed as fault feature ratio (FFR) for identifying weak damage feature and completing early fault detection. Simulated signal and two experimental cases of run to failure are performed to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. The analysis results achieved show that the formulated algorithm can identify clearly early fault symptoms immersed in bearing vibration data.

We measure the depth/diameter ratio of approximately 2,000 simple craters near the north pole of Mercury using Mercury Laser Altimeter data. We find that these craters become distinctly shallower at higher latitudes, where ice is known to have accumulated on their floors. This shallowing corresponds to a maximum infill of around 50 m, consistent with previous estimates. A parallel investigation of approximately 12,000 lunar craters using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data reveals a similar morphological trend near the south pole of the Moon, which we conclude is also due to the presence of thick ice deposits.

To date, however, there have only been very few laboratory oblique impact experiments for analogue targets relevant to the surfaces of extraterrestrial bodies. In particular, there is a lack of laboratory oblique impact experiments into brittle targets with a material strength on the order of 1 MPa, with the exception of ice. A strength on the order of 1 MPa is considered to be the corresponding material strength for the formation of craters in the 100 m size range on the Moon. Impact craters are elliptical if the meteoroid's trajectory is below a certain threshold angle of incidence, and it is known that the threshold angle depends largely on the material strength. Therefore, we examined the threshold angle required to produce elliptical craters in laboratory impact experiments into brittle targets. This work aims to constrain current interpretations of lunar elliptical craters and pit craters with sizes below a hundred meters. We produced mortar targets with compressive strength of 3.2 MPa. A spherical nylon projectile (diameter 7.14 mm) was shot into the target surface at a nominal velocity of 2.3 km/s, with an impact angle of 5deg 90deg from horizontal. The threshold angle of this experiment ranges from 15deg to 20deg. We confirmed that our experimental data agree with previous empirical equations in terms of the cratering efficiency and the threshold impact angle. In addition, in order to simulate the relatively large lunar pit craters related to underground cavities, we conducted a second series of experiments under similar impact conditions using targets with an underground rectangular cavity. Size and outline of craters that created a hole are similar to those of craters without a hole. Moreover, when observed from an oblique angle, a crater with a hole has a topography that resembles the lunar pit craters. The relation between the impact velocity of meteoroids on the Moon and the probability of elliptical crater formation was investigated based on our experimental results and an existing empirical equation. The results suggest a distinct possibility that most craters in the 100 m size range on the Moon, given their elliptical shape, originated as secondary craters."", 'corpus_id': 55085468, 'venue': '', 'year': 2017.0, 'author_names': ['Tatsuhiro Michikami', 'A Hagermann', 'Tomokatsu Morota', ""Jun'ichi Haruyama"", 'Sunao Hasegawa'], 'n_citations': 8, 'n_key_citations': 1, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '129821006', 'title': 'The Geologic History of the Moon', 'abstract': 'More than two decades of study have established the major features of lunar geologic style and history. The most numerous and significant landforms belong to a size morphology series of simple craters, complex craters, and ringed basins that were formed by impacts. Each crater and basin is the source of primary ejecta and secondary craters that, collectively, cover the entire terra. The largest impacts thinned, weakened, and redistributed feldspathic terracrustal material averaging about 75 km in thickness. Relatively small volumes of basalt, generated by partial remelting of mantle material, were erupted through the thin subbasin and subcrater crust to form the maria that cover 16 percent of the lunar surface. Tectonism has modified the various stratigraphic deposits relatively little; most structures are confined to basins and large craters. This general geologic style, basically simple though complex in detail, has persisted longer than 4 aeons (1 aeon 109 yr) Impacts began to leave a visible record about 4.2 aeons ago, after the crust and mantle had differentiated and the crust had solidified. At least 30 basins and 100 times that many craters larger than 30 km in diameter were formed before a massive impact created the Nectaris basin about 3.92 aeons ago.

Although theoretical spallation models were developed about three decades ago, only limited geological observations have been made so far to test these models. The 3.8 km Censorinus crater on the Moon provides an excellent opportunity for studying the impact spallation processes associated with a fresh simple crater formed by oblique impact. Using the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera images, we prepared the ejecta boulder distribution map of Censorinus crater and measured the boulder sizes and shapes. Mapping of about 242,000 ejecta boulders enabled us to document the size distribution of boulders both radial and concentric to the impact crater. Larger size boulders dominate the crater rim areas, while they become smaller away from the crater. The boulder distribution exhibits a radial asymmetry suggesting Censorinus is a oblique impact, in which the uprange ejecta have smaller ranges with larger concentration of boulders near the southwestern crater rim, while the downrange ejecta are in general characterized by smaller boulders with high spatial dispersion. The cumulative size frequency distribution (CSFD) of boulders shows a highly variable fragmentation history in which the uprange boulders suffered more complex fragmentation. The ejecta boulders also exhibit a variety of shapes that are gleaned from their axial ratios and edge angle characteristics. There is a general decrease of axial ratios away from the crater rim. Rectangular boulders dominate the crater rim and they become more equant away from the crater. In addition to the boulder sizes, the boulder shape distribution also exhibits a mild asymmetry in response to the oblique impact. Small size fresh impact craters (84,000 craters) are abundant on the Censorinus ejecta and post date Censorinus. These craters are found in two morphologic types in which a large majority of craters have subdued ejecta (rayless craters) while some possess bright rayed ejecta (bright rayed craters) The CSFD of rayless craters show a steep power law slope with a b value of 4.0, similar to the secondary craters produced by the impact of ejecta from primary craters. We therefore interpret the rayless craters as the secondary craters of Censorinus. On the other hand, the CSFD of bright rayed craters have smaller power law slope b value 2.7) which is a characteristic of primary craters, and thus provide 3 Ma age for Censorinus crater. When the characteristics of Censorinus boulders are compared with the theoretical spallation models that are sensitive to the petrophysical properties of the target (lunar highland) the models generally agree with the Censorinus boulders. However, the observed shape and size characteristics of the Censorinus boulders are found to be more complex than the theoretical spallation models. The ejecta boulders suffered more complex fragmentation and asymmetric distribution in response to the oblique impact. The spallation models accounting oblique impacts have not yet been developed.

To explore this, we analyze sites of explosive volcanism within complex impact craters on the Moon and Mercury, comparing the scale and localization of volcanic activity and evidence for post formation modification of the host crater. We show that the scale of vents and deposits is consistently greater on Mercury than on the Moon, indicating greater eruption energy, powered by a higher concentration of volatiles. Additionally, while the floors of lunar craters hosting explosive volcanism are commonly fractured, those on Mercury are not. The most probable explanation for these differences is that the state of regional compression acting on Mercury's crust through most of the planet's history results in deeper magma storage beneath craters on Mercury than on the Moon. The probable role of the regional stress regime in dictating the depth of intrusion on Mercury suggests that it may also play a role in the depth of sub crater intrusion on the Moon and on other planetary bodies.

We focus on the excavation stage to place better constraints on its controlling factors by comparing the morphology and scale of crater exterior structures for similar sized fresh complex craters on the Moon and Mercury. We find that the ratios of continuous ejecta deposits, continuous secondaries facies, and the largest secondary craters on the continuous secondaries facies between same sized mercurian and lunar craters are consistent with predictions from gravity regime crater scaling laws. Our observations support that gravity is a major controlling factor on the excavation stage of the formation of complex impact craters on the Moon and Mercury. On the other hand, similar sized craters with identical background terrains on Mercury have different spatial densities of secondaries on the continuous secondaries facies, suggesting that impactor velocity may also be important during the excavation stage as larger impactor velocity may also cause greater ejection velocities. Moreover, some craters on Mercury have more circular and less clustered secondaries on the continuous secondaries facies than other craters on Mercury or the Moon. This morphological difference appears not to have been caused by the larger surface gravity or the larger median impact velocity on Mercury. A possible interpretation is that at some places on Mercury, the target material might have unique properties causing larger ejection angles during the impact excavation stage.

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the relationship between ethical leadership and organizational performance. The study was conducted in Meat processing industry in Pietarsaari in 2018. To study the relationship between ethical leadership and organizational performance, a hypothesis was written that stated, ""Ethical Leadership has positive influence on organizational performance."" To check this hypothesis a quantitative survey was conducted with the help of pen and paper questionnaire survey. After carefully analyzing all the data it was concluded that the correlation between ethical leadership and organizational performance appeared to be moderate as well as positive. Numerically, the correlation coefficient between ethical leadership and organizational performance r 0,298 signifies that two variables were moderately associated. Similarly, the value of R square is 0,347, this signifies that 34,7 percent variation on dependent variable is determined by independent variable and p value is 0,039 where null hypothesis is rejected when the p value is less than 0,05, therefore the claim is accepted.

Fishery managers can, however, make use of such alternative sources of information as archaeological and historical data to develop fishery management initiatives. Most Pacific Islands were settled by humans over the last three millennia, although human settlement in Western Melanesia dates from the late Pleistocene, a period of about 40 millennia. Archaeological studies over the past half century contain information on the long term subsistence exploitation of fish and invertebrates from nearshore coral reefs and lagoons. Molluscs appear to have been a very important food source for early human colonists in the Pacific Islands, but declines in abundance through harvest pressure and environmental changes forced a greater reliance on fin fish capture and on agriculture. There is no firm evidence from the archaeological record to suggest that long term subsistence exploitation of reef fish populations has had any serious negative effects on abundance or structure of reef fish communities. Sources for more recent historical information are also exemplified and briefly examined for their usefulness in assessing the impacts of commercial fishing.

This specimen is from a stone covered grave in the Province of Bocas del Toro and is attributed to the Chiriqui culture. MANY PECTORALS or breastplates have been found in prehistoric graves of Panama. Although some of these are made of materials other than gold, the majority are made of this metal. They vary widely in size and weight; some are decorated and some are undecorated. The first mention of such items of jewelry was the comment by Columbus that the natives along the coast of Veraguas (this includes the Panamanian province now known as Bocas del Toro) wore ""espejos de oro"" or mirrors of gold. Only decorated pectorals have been illustrated in archaeological publications (Lothrop 1937: 112 29; 1950: 73; MacCurdy 1911: 223 6) However, Bollaert (1860) mentions that he examined several thin gold plates from Chiriqui, and some of these were undecorated. The gold specimen described here (Fig. 1) was discovered by a huaquero (grave digger) in the highlands of Bocas del Toro, which is the northernmost province in Panama. It was found in a stone covered grave of the Chiriqui culture, which is represented principally in the Province of Chiriqui on the Pacific side of the Cordillera but extends north and west into Costa Rica. Many of the artifacts from this grave were described earlier (Mitchell 1961) but the gold disk was overlooked. As it is believed to be an unfinished pectoral, and since such specimens have not been previously noted in the literature, it appears to warrant this note. The artifact is of a fine yellow gold and weighs 75.4 grams. It averages 0.4 cm. in thickness, and the diameter ranges from 3.8 to 4.2 cm. There are markings near the edges on each face, and these seem to indicate that hammering had begun. Hammering was the method commonly used in the manufacture of such flat work as pectorals. It is possible, of course, that this is not a pectoral in the initial stage of manufacture but an ingot used for storage of gold or for trading purposes. It does not appear to be a nugget because gold is not often found in nuggets of this size.

Unquestionably, the broadness of the subject caused the article to exceed by far the length requested by the editors. The two portions that disappeared weakened my point that the understanding of the differences between the archaeologies practiced on either side of the Rio Grande should be sought in the historical process of which the two predominant colonialisms in America, the Anglo Saxon and the Hispanic, are a part. The colonization of Hispano America began at the end of the fifteenth century, reaching its peak in the sixteenth; the corresponding periods for that of Anglo America were the seventeenth century and end of the eighteenth when its Revolution and Independence took place. The bare indication of dates does not suffice to explain the profoundly important historical events that took place over that lapse of time. For the Hispano American motherland it spelled the end of the Reconquest with the fall of Granada, the last of the Moorish redoubts, in 1492. With the discovery of America in the same year, the Reconquest was prolonged on the soil of the New World. Spain, which did not yet exist as a nation, was consolidated under Charles I of Spain and V of Germany. This signified, at the same time, a break with its isolation from Europe, an event that took place when it led the Counter Reformation materially and spiritually while England under Henry the Eighth laid down the foundations of puritanism. Also, parallel with the consolidation of British parliamentarianism, Spain, now joined with Portugal, consolidated royal absolutism. The Renaissance ended and humanism began; rationalism appeared with Descartes, and it was the time of Francis Bacon. Moreover, capitalism and the modern epoch were ushered in. It seems to me that this brief outline of the historical phenomena that establish the variances between the two colonizations is important, since they provide a basis for understanding the processes that determined the history of the Americas.

Deer were the most frequently consumed mammal in most pre Columbian refuse deposits, and deer bones and antlers were used to fashion several kinds of implements. Spanish eye witness chroniclers of the years of conquest (1515 1550 CE) refer to cultural proscriptions against eating mammal meat by certain groups in the chiefdoms that bordered Parita Bay on the Pacific coast. Spanish soldiers extolled larders replete with dried and salted deer carcasses. This situation alludes to periodic ""feasts"" which are considered to be an important mechanism for enhancing social relations and for cementing alliances.

Using wild and domesticated species in the genus Cucurbita along with their F1 and F2 progeny, we have demonstrated that the production of large diagnostic phytoliths in fruit rinds exhibits a one to one correspondence to the lignification of these structures. We propose that phytolith formation in Cucurbita fruits is primarily determined by a dominant genetic locus, called hard rind (Hr) previously shown to code for lignin deposition. If true, this evidence represents a demonstration of genetic control over phytolith production in a dicotyledon and provides considerable support to hypotheses that silica phytoliths constitute another important system of mechanical defense in plants. Our research also identifies Hr as another single locus controlling more than one important phenotypic difference between wild and domesticated plants, and establishes rind tissue cell structure and hardness under the effects of Hr as an important determinant of phytolith morphology.

We used data from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas version 5, which include about 2 million pCO2 measurements in the tropical Pacific. Unlike many previous studies that estimated pCO2 fields from relationships with other variables like sea surface temperature, we developed gridded products of monthly means using a technique to interpolate measured pCO2 values. Large seasonal variation of pCO2 appears in the cold tongue region (EQ 20degS, east of 120degW) corresponding to the seasonal variation of coastal upwelling, and in the off equatorial region where the thermodynamic effect on pCO2 dominates. Consistent with previous findings, pCO2 along the equator declines during El Nino due to weakening of the easterly winds and therefore reduced upwelling of CO2 rich subsurface water. We also quantified the spatial distribution of the long term pCO2 trend beyond the area averaged trend presented previously. The long term trend of pCO2 is positive in all regions with an area average of 1.8 0.1 matm yr 1. However, along the equator the trend is 2 matm yr 1 linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation forcing.

We propose a ""mechanistic semi analytic algorithm"" (MeSAA) to estimate sea surface pCO2 in river dominated coastal oceans using satellite data. Observed pCO2 can be analytically expressed as the sum of individual components controlled by major factors such as thermodynamics (or temperature) mixing, and biology. With marine carbonate system calculations, temperature and mixing effects can be predicted using thermodynamic principles and by assuming conservative two end member mixing of total dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity (e.g. the Changjiang River and Kuroshio water in the East China Sea, ECS) Next, an integral expression for pCO2 drawdown due to biological effects can be parameterized using the chlorophyll a concentration (chla) We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the algorithm in the ECS during summertime. Sensitivity analysis shows that errors in empirical coefficients and three input satellite parameters (salinity, SST, chla) have limited influence on the algorithm, and satellite derived pCO2 is consistent with underway data, even though no in situ pCO2 data from the ECS shelves was used to train the algorithm.

This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceived selfefficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self efficacy and behavioral changes.

New York: W. H. Freeman (www.whfreeman.com) 1997, 604 pp. $46.00 (hardcover) Enter the term ""self efficacy"" in the on line PSYCLIT database and you will find over 2500 articles, all of which stem from the seminal contributions of Albert Bandura. It is difficult to do justice to the immense importance of this research for our theories, our practice, and indeed for human welfare. Self efficacy (SE) has proven to be a fruitful construct in spheres ranging from phobias (Bandura, Jeffery, Gajdos, 1975) and depression (Holahan Holahan, 1987) to career choice behavior (Betz Hackett, 1986) and managerial functioning (Jenkins, 1994) Bandura\'s Self Efficacy: The Exercise of Control is the best attempt so far at organizing, summarizing, and distilling meaning from this vast and diverse literature. Self Efficacy may prove to be Bandura\'s magnum opus. Dr. Bandura has done an impressive job of summarizing over 1800 studies and papers, integrating these results into a coherent framework, and detailing implications for theory and practice. While incorporating prior works such as Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) and ""Self efficacy mechanism in human agency"" (Bandura, 1982) Self Efficacy extends these works by describing results of diverse new research, clarifying and extending social cognitive theory, and fleshing out implications of the theory for groups, organizations, political bodies, and societies. Along the way, Dr. Bandura masterfully contrasts social cognitive theory with many other theories of human behavior and helps chart a course for future research. Throughout, B andura\' s clear, firm, and self confident writing serves as the perfect vehicle for the theory he espouses. Self Efficacy begins with the most detailed and clear explication of social cognitive theory that I have yet seen, and proceeds to delineate the nature and sources of SE, the well known processes via which SE mediates human behavior, and the development of SE over the life span. After laying this theoretical groundwork, subsequent chapters delineate the relevance of SE to human endeavor in a variety of specific content areas including cognitive and intellectual functioning; health; clinical problems including anxiety, phobias, depression, eating disorders, alcohol problems, and drug abuse; athletics and exercise activity; organizations; politics; and societal change. In Bandura\'s words, ""Perceived self efficacy refers to beliefs in one\'s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments"" (p. 3) People\'s SE beliefs have a greater effect on their motivation, emotions, and actions than what is objectively true (e.g. actual skill level) Therefore, SE beliefs are immensely important in choice of behaviors (including occupations, social relationships, and a host of day to day behaviors) effort expenditure, perseverance in pursuit of goals, resilience to setbacks and problems, stress level and affect, and indeed in our ways of thinking about ourselves and others. Bandura affirms many times that humans are proactive and free as well as determined: They are ""at least partial architects of their own destinies"" (p. 8) Because SE beliefs powerfully affect human behaviors, they are a key factor in human purposive activity or agency; that is, in human freedom. Because humans shape their environment even as they are shaped by it, SE beliefs are also pivotal in the construction of our social and physical environments.

Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceived selfefficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation.

Perceived self efficacy helps to ac count for such diverse phenomena as changes in coping behavior produced by different modes of influence, level of physiological stress reactions, self regulation of refractory behavior, resignation and despondency to failure experiences, self debilitating effects of proxy control and illusory inefficaciousness, achievement strivings, growth of intrinsic interest, and career pur suits.

After presenting an overview of self efficacy theory, I contrast self efficacy with related constructs (perceived control, outcome expectations, perceived value of outcomes, attributions, and selfconcept) and discuss some efficacy research relevant to academic motivation. Studies of the effects of person variables (goal setting and information processing) and situation variables (models, attributional feedback, and rewards) on self efficacy and motivation are reviewed. In conjunction with this discussion, I mention substantive issues that need to be addressed in the self efficacy research and summarize evidence on the utility of self efficacy for predicting motivational outcomes. Areas for future research are suggested. Article: The concept of personal expectancy has a rich history in psychological theory on human motivation (Atkinson, 1957; Rotter, 1966; Weiner, 1979) Research conducted within various theoretical traditions supports the idea that expectancy can influence behavioral instigation, direction, effort, and persistence (Bandura, 1986; Locke Latham, 1990; Weiner, 1985) In this article, I discuss academic motivation in terms of one type of personal expectancy: self efficacy, defined as ""People\'s judgments of their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to attain designated types of performances"" (Bandura, 1986, p. 391) Since Bandura\'s (1977) seminal article on selfefficacy, much research has clarified and extended the role of self efficacy as a mechanism underlying behavioral change, maintenance, and generalization. For example, there is evidence that self efficacy predicts such diverse outcomes as academic achievements, social skills, smoking cessation, pain tolerance, athletic performances, career choices, assertiveness, coping with feared events, recovery from heart attack, and sales performance (Bandura, 1986) After presenting an overview of self efficacy theory and comparison of self efficacy with related constructs, I discuss some self efficacy research relevant to academic motivation, pointing out substantive issues that need to be addressed. I conclude with recommendations for future research. SELF EFFICACY THEORY Antecedents and Consequences Bandura (1977) hypothesized that self efficacy affects an individual\'s choice of activities, effort, and persistence. People who have a low sense of efficacy for accomplishing a task may avoid it; those who believe they are capable should participate readily. Individuals who feel efficacious are hypothesized to work harder and persist longer when they encounter difficulties than those who doubt their capabilities. Self efficacy theory postulates that people acquire information to appraise efficacy from their performance accomplishments, vicarious (observational) experiences, forms of persuasion, and physiological indexes. An individual\'s own performances offer the most reliable guides for assessing efficacy. Successes raise efficacy and failure lowers it, but once a strong sense of efficacy is developed, a failure may not have much impact (Bandura, 1986) An individual also acquires capability information from knowledge of others. Similar others offer the best basis for comparison (Schunk, 1989b) Observing similar peers perform a task conveys to observers that they too are capable of accomplishing it. Information acquired vicariously typically has a weaker effect on self efficacy than performance based information; a vicarious increase in efficacy can be negated by subsequent failures. Students often receive persuasory information that they possess the capabilities to perform a task (e.g. ""You can do this"" Positive persuasory feedback enhances self efficacy, but this increase will be temporary if subsequent efforts turn out poorly. Students also derive efficacy information from physiological indexes (e.g. heart rate and sweating) Bodily symptoms signaling anxiety might be interpreted to indicate a lack of skills. Information acquired from these sources does not automatically influence efficacy; rather, it is cognitively appraised (Bandura, 1986) Efficacy appraisal is an inferential process in which persons weigh and combine the contributions of such personal and situational factors as their perceived ability, the difficulty of the task, amount of effort expended, amount of external assistance received, number and pattern of successes and failures, their perceived similarity to models, and persuader credibility (Schunk, 1989b) Self efficacy is not the only influence on behavior; it is not necessarily the most important. Behavior is a function of many variables. In achievement settings some other important variables are skills, outcome expectations, and the perceived value of outcomes (Schunk, 1989b) High self efficacy will not produce competent performances when requisite skills are lacking. Outcome expectations, or beliefs concerning the probable outcomes of actions, are important because individuals are not motivated to act in ways they believe will result in negative outcomes. Perceived value of outcomes refers to how much people desire certain outcomes relative to others. Given adequate skills, positive outcome expectations, and personally valued outcomes, self efficacy is hypothesized to influence the choice and direction of much human behavior (Bandura, 1989b) Schunk (1989b) discussed how self efficacy might operate during academic learning. At the start of an activity, students differ in their beliefs about their capabilities to acquire knowledge, perform skills, master the material, and so forth. Initial self efficacy varies as a function of aptitude (e.g. abilities and attitudes) and prior experience. Such personal factors as goal setting and information processing, along with situational factors (e.g. rewards and teacher feedback) affect students while they are working. From these factors students derive cues signaling how well they are learning, which they use to assess efficacy for further learning. Motivation is enhanced when students perceive they are making progress in learning. In turn, as students work on tasks and become more skillful, they maintain a sense of self efficacy for performing well.', 'corpus_id': 5285325, 'venue': 'Nursing management', 'year': 2000.0, 'author_names': ['Bissoondial Ootim'], 'n_citations': 5078, 'n_key_citations': 921, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '145391498', 'title': 'Perceived behavioral control, self efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior.', 'abstract': 'Conceptual and methodological ambiguities surrounding the concept of perceived behavioral control are clarified. It is shown that perceived control over performance of a behavior, though comprised of separable components that reflect beliefs about self efficacy and about controllability, can nevertheless be considered a unitary latent variable in a hierarchical factor model. It is further argued that there is no necessary correspondence between self efficacy and internal control factors, or between controllability and external control factors. Self efficacy and controllability can reflect internal as well as external factors and the extent to which they reflect one or the other is an empirical question. Finally, a case is made that measures of perceived behavioral control need to incorporate self efficacy as well as controllability items that are carefully selected to ensure high internal consistency. Summary and Conclusions Perceived control over performance of a behavior can account for consider able variance in intentions and actions. However, ambiguities surrounding the concept of perceived behavioral control have tended to create uncertainties and to impede progress. The present article attempted to clarify conceptual ambiguities and resolve issues related to the operationalization of perceived behavioral control. Recent research has demonstrated that the overarching concept of perceived behavioral control, as commonly assessed, is comprised of two components: self efficacy (dealing largely with the ease or difficulty of performing a behavior) and controllability (the extent to which performance is up to the actor) Contrary to a widely accepted view, it was argued that self efficacy expectations do not necessarily correspond to beliefs about internal control factors, and that controllability expectations have no necessary basis in the perceived operation of external factors. Instead, it was suggested that self efficacy and controllability may both reflect beliefs about the presence of internal as well as external factors. Rather than making a priori assumptions about the internal or external locus of self efficacy and controllability, this issue is best treated as an empirical question. Also of theoretical significance, the present article tried to dispel the notion that self efficacy and controllability are incompatible with, or independent of, each other. Although factor analyses of perceived behavioral control items provide clear and consistent evidence for the distinction, there is sufficient commonality between self efficacy and controllability to suggest a two level hierarchical model. In this model, perceived behavioral control is the overarching, superordinate construct that is comprised of two lower level components: self efficacy and controllability. This view of the control component in the theory of planned behavior implies that measures of perceived behavioral control should contain items that assess self efficacy as well as controllability. Depending on the purpose of the investigation, a decision can be made to aggregate over all items, treating perceived behavioral control as a unitary factor, or to distinguish between self efficacy and controllability by entering separate indices into the prediction equation.', 'corpus_id': 145391498, 'venue': '', 'year': 2002.0, 'author_names': ['Icek Ajzen'], 'n_citations': 5511, 'n_key_citations': 667, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '220766', 'title': 'Computer Self Efficacy: Development of a Measure and Initial Test', 'abstract': ""This paper discusses the role of individuals' beliefs about their abilities to competently use computers (computer self efficacy) in the determination of computer use.

An individual's self efficacy and outcome expecta tions were found to be positively influenced by the encouragement of others in their work group, as well as others' use of computers. Thus, self efficacy represents an important individual trait, which moderates organizational influences (such as encouragement and support) on an individual's decision to use computers.

For example, a business executive may have a high sense of organizational efficacy but low parenting efficacy. Thus, the efficacy belief system is not a global trait but a differentiated set of self beliefs linked to distinct realms of functioning. Multidomain measures reveal the patterning and degree of generality of people\'s sense of personal efficacy. There is no all purpose measure of perceived self efficacy. The "" one measure fits all "" approach usually has limited explanatory and predictive value because most of the items in an all purpose test may have little or no relevance to the domain of functioning. Moreover, in an effort to serve all purposes, items in such a measure are usually cast in general terms divorced from the situational demands and circumstances.

BANDURA efficacy must be tailored to the particular domain of functioning that is the object of interest. Although efficacy beliefs are multifaceted, social cognitive theory identifies several conditions under which they may co vary even across distinct domains of functioning (Bandura, 1997) When different spheres of activity are governed by similar sub skills there is some inter domain relation in perceived efficacy. Proficient performance is partly guided by higher order self regulatory skills. These include generic skills for diagnosing task demands, constructing and evaluating alternative courses of action, setting proximal goals to guide one\'s efforts, and creating self incentives to sustain engagement in taxing activities and to manage stress and debilitating intrusive thoughts. Generic self management strategies developed in one realm of activity are serviceable in other activity domains with resulting co variation in perceived efficacy among them. Co development is still another correlative process. Even if different activity domains are not sub served by common sub skills, the same perceived efficacy can occur if development of competencies is socially structured so that skills in dissimilar domains are developed together.

A sociodemographic questionnaire was applied to them, the self concept test AF and the APGAR family, in order to analyze the level of physical sporting practice, the type of family and the level of self concept. The results showed that the majority of the participants in the study were regular practitioners of physical activity (74.0% who by level 35.6% were federated. The majority presented a normal family functionality (81.5% and the academic and physical self concept are the most valued (figures around 3.60) In the same way it is detected that the physical self concept is greater in men and that when it is federated, the general self concept increases, just as it happens when the familiar functionality is normal. As a main conclusion it can be pointed out that the regular practice of physical activity increases the levels of self concept', 'corpus_id': 198873474, 'venue': 'Retos', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Manuel Gentil Adarve', 'Felix Zurita Ortega', 'Victor Gomez Sanchez', 'Rosario Padial Ruz', 'Amador Jesus Lara Sanchez'], 'n_citations': 2, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '148629253', 'title': 'Habitos alimentarios y practica de actividad fisica en una muestra de adolescentes de una ciudad del norte de Espana', 'abstract': 'espanolEl objetivo de este estudio ha sido conocer si las horas de practica deportiva extraescolar que realizan los adolescentes pueda relacionarse con el numero de ingestas diarias, diferenciando los resultados por genero, etapa evolutiva y nivel de estudios de los padres.

EnglishIntroduction: During the last decades, Spanish youth population has undergone numerous changes in their eating and physical exercise patterns, highlighting the high percentage of adolescents who come to their school without having breakfast. Several studies show that school education can produce beneficial effects, promote physical activity and healthy eating habits that remain the rest of life. Objectives: To establish the prevalence of nutritional habits and physical exercise in child and adolescent population of Benicassim during the academic year 2015 2016 from 6th grade of primary school to 2nd grade of high school. Methods: An observational, cross curricular and descriptive study shows both the eating and physical exercise habits through the Global School Based Student Health Survey GSHS (eating and sports sections) 143 students participated, ranging from the last course of Primary Education to the last course of Upper Secondary Education in Benicassim. Results: The vast majority of students have shown to have good eating habits (having breakfast every day, having some snack between meals, consumption of dairy products and a moderate consumption of savoury and fatty products) Yet, 20 of them seem to lack these habits. Boys practice more exercise (3 4 days) than girls (2 3 days) The latter, girls, also spend more time sitting than boys. Conclusions: Most of students present healthy habits; however, some of them do not eat breakfast on a daily basis.

The Gadgil effect, where competition between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for nitrogen slows litter decomposition, may increase soil carbon. However, experimental evidence for the Gadgil effect is equivocal. Here, we apply resource ratio theory to assess whether interguild fungal competition for different forms of organic nitrogen can affect litter decomposition. We focus on variation in resource input ratios and fungal resource use traits, and evaluate our model's predictions by synthesizing prior experimental literature examining ectomycorrhizal effects on litter decomposition. In our model, resource input ratios determined whether ectomycorrhizal fungi suppressed saprotrophic fungi. Recalcitrant litter inputs favored the former over the latter, allowing the Gadgil effect only when such inputs predominated. Though ectomycorrhizal fungi did not always hamper litter decomposition, ectomycorrhizal nitrogen uptake always increased carbon:nitrogen ratios in litter. Our meta analysis of empirical studies supports our theoretical results: ectomycorrhizal fungi appear to slow decomposition of leaf litter only in forests where litter inputs are highly recalcitrant. We thus find that the specific contribution of the Gadgil effect to high soil carbon:nitrogen ratios in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems may be smaller than previously predicted.

Earthworm casts represent hot spots for carbon turnover and formation of biogeochemical interfaces in soils. Due to the complex microscale architecture of casts, understanding the mechanisms of cast formation and development at a process relevant scale, i.e. within microaggregates and at the interface between plant residues, microorganisms and mineral particles, remains challenging. We used stable isotope enrichment to trace the fate of shoot and root litter in intact earthworm cast samples. Surface casts produced by epi anecic earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) were collected after 8 and 54 weeks of soil incubation in mesocosms, in the presence of 13C labeled Ryegrass shoot or root litter deposited onto the soil surface. To study the alteration in the chemical composition from initial litter to particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral associated organic matter (MOM) in cast samples, we used solid state 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (13C CPMAS NMR) and isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (EA IRMS) We used spectromicroscopic approach to identify plant tissues and microorganisms involved in plant decomposition within casts. A combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nano scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) was used to obtain the distribution of organic carbon and d13C within intact cast sample structures. We clearly demonstrate a different fate of shoot and root derived organic carbon in earthworm casts, with a higher abundance of less degraded root residues recovered as particulate organic matter on the short term (8 weeks) (73 mg.g 1 in Cast Root vs 44 mg.g 1 in Cast Shoot) At the early stages of litter decomposition, the chemical composition of the initial litter was the main factor controlling the composition and distribution of soil organic matter within casts. At later stages, we can demonstrate a clear reduction of structural and chemical differences in root and shoot derived organic products. After one year, MOM clearly dominated the casts (more than 85 of the total OC in the MOM fraction) We were able to highlight the shift from a system dominated by free plant residues to a system dominated by MOM during cast formation and development.', 'corpus_id': 129947462, 'venue': 'Front.

This is problematic because it has left a major gap in our understanding of PSFs in natural ecosystems, where plant litter is a key component of feedback effects. Here, we propose a new conceptual framework that integrates rhizosphere and litter mediated PSF effects. Our framework provides insights into the relative contribution of direct effects mediated by interactions between plants and soil rhizosphere organisms, and indirect effects between plants and decomposer organisms mediated by plant root and shoot litter. We distinguish between three pathways through which senesced root and shoot litter may influence PSFs. Specifically, we examine: (1) physical effects of litter (layer) traits on seed germination, soil structure, and plant growth; (2) chemical effects of litter on concentrations of soil nutrients and secondary metabolites (e.g. allelopathic chemicals) and (3) biotic effects of saprotrophic soil communities that can perform different functional roles in the soil food web, or that may have specialized interactions with litter types, thereby altering soil nutrient cycling. We assess the role of litter in PSF effects via physical, chemical and biotic pathways to address how litter mediated feedbacks may play out relative to, and in interaction with, feedbacks mediated through the plant rhizosphere.

A Review', 'abstract': 'Chicken litter application on land as an organic fertilizer is the cheapest and most environmentally safe method of disposing of the volume generated from the rapidly expanding poultry industry worldwide. However, little is known about the safety of chicken litter for land application and general release into the environment. Bridging this knowledge gap is crucial for maximizing the benefits of chicken litter as an organic fertilizer and mitigating negative impacts on human and environmental health. The key safety concerns of chicken litter are its contamination with pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, helminthes, parasitic protozoa, and viruses; antibiotics and antibiotic resistant genes; growth hormones such as egg and meat boosters; heavy metals; and pesticides. Despite the paucity of literature about chicken litter safety for land application, the existing information was scattered and disjointed in various sources, thus making them not easily accessible and difficult to interpret. We consolidated scattered pieces of information about known contaminants found in chicken litter that are of potential risk to human, animal, and environmental health and how they are spread. This review tested the hypothesis that in its current form, chicken litter does not meet the minimum standards for application as organic fertilizer. The review entails a meta analysis of technical reports, conference proceedings, peer reviewed journal articles, and internet texts. Our findings indicate that direct land application of chicken litter could be harming animal, human, and environmental health. For example, counts of pathogenic strains of Eschericia coli (105 1010 CFU g 1) and Coliform bacteria (106 108 CFU g 1) exceeded the maximum permissible limits (MPLs) for land application. In Australia, 100% of broiler litter tested was contaminated with Actinobacillus and re used broiler litter was more contaminated with Salmonella than non re used broiler litter. Similarly, in the US, all (100% broiler litter was contaminated with Eschericia coli containing genes resistant to over seven antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin, ceftiofur, tetracycline, and sulfonamide. Chicken litter is also contaminated with a vast array of antibiotics and heavy metals. There are no standards set specifically for chicken litter for most of its known contaminants. Even where standards exist for related products such as compost, there is wide variation across countries and bodies mandated to set standards for safe disposal of organic wastes. More rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the level of contamination in chicken litter from both broilers and layers, especially in developing countries where there is hardly any data; set standards for all the contaminants; and standardize these standards across all agencies, for safe disposal of chicken litter on land.', 'corpus_id': 202746320, 'venue': 'International journal of environmental research and public health', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['M Kyakuwaire', 'Giregon Olupot', 'Alice Amoding', 'Peter Nkedi-Kizza', 'Twaha Ali Ateenyi Basamba'], 'n_citations': 27, 'n_key_citations': 1, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '53492588', 'title': 'Grazing Management and Buffer Strip Impact on Nitrogen Runoff from Pastures Fertilized with Poultry Litter.', 'abstract': 'Nitrogen runoff from pastures fertilized with animal manure, such as poultry litter, can result in accelerated eutrophication.

A 12 yr study was conducted on 15 small watersheds in Booneville, AR, using five management practices: continuous grazing, haying, rotational grazing, rotational grazing with an unfertilized buffer strip, and rotational grazing with a fenced unfertilized riparian buffer. Poultry litter was applied annually at a rate of 5.6 Mg ha. Concentrations and loads of total N, NO N, NH N, organic N, and total organic C in runoff varied intra and interannually and coincided with precipitation trends. Overall, the greatest component of total N in runoff was organic N. Rotational grazing resulted in the highest concentrations and loads of all forms of N in runoff compared with other treatments, including the continuously grazed paddocks, which were grazed almost twice as much. Total organic C concentrations and loads in runoff were also higher from rotationally grazed watersheds than other treatments. Rotational grazing is considered a best management practice that typically reduces soil erosion; hence, the mechanism by which it caused higher N and C runoff is unclear.

Floating litter was found throughout the entire study area with densities ranging from 0 to 9205 items/km2 and with a mean abundance of 492 AML items/km2 and 77 NML items/km2 across all surveyed locations. Maximum AML densities >3500 items/km2) were recorded in the Adriatic Sea, while the lowest densities <50 items/km2) were found along the coastline of Sardinia and in the Strait of Messina.

Considering the tunnel as a geometrical sweeping feature, we propose an effective tunnel deformation inspection algorithm by extracting the global spatial axis from the poor quality raw point cloud. Essentially, we convert tunnel axis extraction into an iterative fitting optimization problem. Specifically, given the scanned raw point cloud of a tunnel, the initial design axis is sampled to generate a series of normal planes within the corresponding Frenet frame, followed by intersecting those planes with the tunnel point cloud to yield a sequence of cross sections. By fitting cross sections with circles, the fitted circle centers are approximated with a B Spline curve, which is considered as an updated axis. The procedure of ""circle fitting and B SPline approximation"" repeats iteratively until convergency, that is, the distance of each fitted circle center to the current axis is smaller than a given threshold. By this means, the spatial axis of the tunnel can be accurately obtained.

Based on the research foundation of 3D laser scanning technology in the field of rock mass structural surface identification, this paper proposes a critical rock identification and stability analysis method based on laser point cloud technology. First, a calculation method for a closed critical rock body is proposed. Second, block theory and point cloud technology are combined. Then, by utilizing the high density features of the point cloud, the vector analysis method of the traditional critical rock is converted into the space coordinates of the 3D point cloud, and the internal coordinate system of the 3D laser scanning system is directly used to extract the X, Y, and Z coordinate values of the corner points of the critical rock. Next, these coordinates are spatially compared and analyzed, and the key critical rock determination and its corresponding instability method are identified. Finally, the movable identification and stability analysis of the critical rock on the geometric scale is attained. This paper mainly summarizes the identification of closed critical rock bodies, the movable identification of key critical rock, and the determination methods of three types of critical rock instability modes as follows: falling type, single sided sliding type, and double sided sliding type.

This work introduces the concept of hierarchical modeling to automatically derive a measured and accurate representation of a 3D shield tunnel. Our key observation is that the shield tunnel is composed of a certain number of segment pieces arranged in some designed patterns. We hereby apply hierarchical segmentation and element extraction, based on designed patterns, to intensity images without expensive computation. According to the corresponding relationship between the point cloud and the image, the segment pieces within the point cloud are extracted. Therefore, we construct the corresponding 3D models of the segment pieces to obtain the precise structure model of the tunnel. As a result, segment pieces are extracted robustly, even in the presence of noise and large occlusion. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of the proposed algorithm are presented with state of the art methods.

In the first part of this thesis uncertainty estimation via ensemble and single model approaches is discussed in detail and a new class of models for uncertainty estimation, called Prior Networks, is proposed. Prior Networks are able to emulate an ensemble of models using a single deterministic neural network, which allows sources of uncertainty to be determined within the same probabilistic framework as in ensemble based approaches, but with the computational simplicity and ease of training of single model approaches. Thus, Prior Networks combine the advantages of ensemble and single model approaches to estimating uncertainty. In this thesis Prior Networks are evaluated on a range classification datasets, where they are shown to outperform baseline approaches, such as Monte Carlo dropout, on the task of detecting out of distribution inputs.

This thesis focuses on Dose Guided Radiotherapy (DGRT) using portal dosimetry with the Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) as a method for treatment verification. Automatic error detection and consequently patient selection for adaptive radiotherapy using portal dosimetry remains difficult. This is due to the unknown uncertainty of the portal dosimetry methods, as well as the lack of objective triggers for adaptation and the use of simple decision protocols (often consisting of an action threshold on a single metric) that cannot take the multidimensionality of the EPID dose distributions into account. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate and improve the error detection capabilities of portal dosimetry methods. The first part of the thesis concerns uncertainties and sensitivity of portal dosimetry methods. A framework for analyzing uncertainties of portal dosimetry methods was developed, and factors influencing the uncertainty, and the sensitivity and specificity of portal dosimetry were investigated and quantified. It is important to incorporate this quantitative knowledge in decision protocols for adaptive radiotherapy. The second part focuses on advanced methods for error detection and classification, applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to portal dosimetry. Several AI methods and classification problems were investigated to show the potential of AIbased error detection for portal dosimetry. First, it was shown that it is possible to relate 2D portal dosimetry results to differences in dose volume histogram metrics by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) a relationship that is notoriously difficult to find with traditional action threshold based classification methods. Second, it was demonstrated that deep learning is a promising powerful tool for identifying types of treatment errors with portal dosimetry. Errors can be identified to a high level of detail, and this approach can provide additional information not currently available from portal dosimetry. Third, external validation of a machine learning model for classifying anatomical changes showed that it is difficult to use such a model directly on clinical data from a different institute due to differences in data acquisition and clinical interpretation. Overall, portal dosimetry for DGRT can greatly benefit from improved error detection methods. This thesis has contributed to this improvement, by providing a framework for uncertainty analysis of portal dosimetry methods, by examining the sensitivity and specificity for action threshold based classification methods for various portal dosimetry methods, and by investigating various advanced AI algorithms and error classification problems.

Numerical discretisations are obtained using the stochastic Galerkin Finite Element Method (SGFEM) which generates approximations of the solution in tensor product spaces of finite element spaces and finite dimensional spaces of multivariate polynomials in the random parameters. Firstly, we propose an adaptive SGFEM algorithm which employs reliable and efficient hierarchical a posteriori energy error estimates of the solution to parametric PDEs. The main novelty of the algorithm is that a balance between spatial and parametric approximations is ensured by choosing the enhancement associated with dominant error reduction estimates. Next, we introduce a two level a posteriori estimate of the energy error in SGFEM approximations. We prove that this error estimate is reliable and efficient. Then we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the adaptive algorithm driven by two level error estimates. Four different marking strategies for refinement of stochastic Galerkin approximations are proposed and, in particular, for two of them, we prove that the sequence of energy errors computed by associated algorithms converges linearly. Finally, we use duality techniques for the goal oriented error estimation in approximating linear quantities of interest derived from solutions to parametric PDEs. Adaptive enhancements in the proposed algorithm are guided by an innovative strategy that combines the error reduction estimates computed for spatial and parametric components of corresponding primal and dual solutions.

Input modelling error is the uncertainty in the output of a simulation that propagates from the errors in the input models used to drive it. When the input models are estimated from observations of the real world system input modelling error will always arise as only a finite number of observations can ever be collected. Input modelling error can be broken down into two components: variance, known in the literature as input uncertainty; and bias. In this thesis new methodology is contributed for the quantification of both of these sources of error. To date research into input modelling error has been focused on quantifying the input uncertainty (IU) variance. In this thesis current IU quantification techniques for simulation models with time homogeneous inputs are extended to simulation models with nonstationary input processes. Unlike the IU variance, the bias caused by input modelling has, until now, been virtually ignored. This thesis provides the first method for quantifying bias caused by input modelling. Also presented is a bias detection test for identifying, with controlled power, a bias due to input modelling of a size that would be concerning to a practitioner. The final contribution of this thesis is a spline based arrival process model. By utilising a highly flexible spline representation, the error in the input model is reduced; it is believed that this will also reduce the input modelling error that passes to the simulation output.

Chapters 1 4 are devoted to the problem of processes discretization at stopping times. In Chapter 1 we study the optimal discretization error of stochastic integrals, driven by a multidimensional continuous Brownian semimartingale. In this setting we establish a path wise lower bound for the renormalized quadratic variation of the error and we provide a sequence of discretization stopping times, which is asymptotically optimal. The latter is defined as hitting times of random ellipsoids by the semimartingale at hand. In comparison with previous available results, we allow a quite large class of semimartingales and we prove that the asymptotic lower bound is attainable. In Chapter 2 we study the model adaptive optimal discretization error of stochastic integrals. In Chapter 1 the construction of the optimal strategy involved the knowledge about the diffusion coefficient of the semimartingale under study. In this work we provide a model adaptive asymptotically optimal discretization strategy that does not require any prior knowledge about the model. In Chapter 3 we study the convergence in distribution of renormalized discretization errors of Ito processes for a concrete general class of random discretization grids given by stopping times. Previous works on the subject only treat the case of dimension 1. Moreover they either focus on particular cases of grids, or provide results under quite abstract assumptions with implicitly specified limit distribution. At the contrast we provide explicitly the limit distribution in a tractable form in terms of the underlying model. The results hold both for multidimensional processes and general multidimensional error terms. In Chapter 4 we study the problem of parametric inference for diffusions based on observations at random stopping times. We work in the asymptotic framework of high frequency data over a fixed horizon. Previous works on the subject consider only deterministic, strongly predictable or random, independent of the process, observation times, and do not cover our setting. Under mild assumptions we construct a consistent sequence of estimators, for a large class of stopping time observation grids. Further we carry out the asymptotic analysis of the estimation error and establish a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) with a mixed Gaussian limit. In addition, in the case of a 1 dimensional parameter, for any sequence of estimators verifying CLT conditions without bias, we prove a uniform a.s. lower bound on the asymptotic variance, and show that this bound is sharp. In Chapters 5 6 we study the problem of uncertainty quantification for stochastic approximation limits. In Chapter 5 we analyze the uncertainty quantification for the limit of a Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm. In our setup, this limit is defined as the zero of a function given by an expectation. The expectation is taken w.r.t. a random variable for which the model is assumed to depend on an uncertain parameter. We consider the SA limit as a function of this parameter. We introduce the so called Uncertainty for SA (USA) algorithm, an SA algorithm in increasing dimension for computing the basis coefficients of a chaos expansion of this function on an orthogonal basis of a suitable Hilbert space. The almost sure and Lp convergences of USA, in the Hilbert space, are established under mild, tractable conditions. In Chapter 6 we analyse the L2 convergence rate of the USA algorithm designed in Chapter 5.The analysis is non trivial due to infinite dimensionality of the procedure. Moreover, our setting is not covered by the previous works on infinite dimensional SA. The obtained rate depends non trivially on the model and the design parameters of the algorithm.

However, the open access environment makes the cooperating platoon CAVs vulnerable to cyberattacks, causing concerns on traffic safety and mobility. So far, due to the lack of analytical models integrating malicious effects of manipulated information into CAV dynamics, we have limited knowledge on CAV platoon performance under cyberattack. It necessities a modeling framework to support a comprehensive analysis of the CAV platoon performance in a capricious travel environment. This study seeks to bridge this critical gap from the following three aspects. First, we review potential safety related cyberattacks faced by CAVs, related to manipulation of vehicle position, speed, and acceleration. Based on the review, these cyberattacks are categorized into three types: bogus messages, replay/delay, and collusion attack. Second, we develop a generalized vehicle dynamics model that accounts for the cyberattack effects on CAV dynamics. The proposed model, labeled cooperative intelligent driver model (CIDM) integrates the dynamic communication topological structure to enable the analysis of effects of manipulated information on CAV dynamics. The dynamic communication structure is a time varying function which is determined by the communication range and the distance between two vehicles.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of ""self driving"" cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of ""connected vehicles"" (United States) or ""cooperative ITS"" (Europe) These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting.

One of the primary tools in the testing and validation of these systems is a comparison between virtual and physical based simulations, which provides a low cost, systems approach testing of frequently occurring driving scenarios such as vehicle platooning and edge cases and sensor spoofing in congested areas. Consequently, the project team developed a robotic vehicle platform Scaled Testbed for Automated and Robotic Systems (STARS) to be used for accelerated testing elements of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) including data acquisition through sensor fusion practices typically observed in the field of robotics. This paper will highlight the implementation of STARS as a scaled testbed for rapid prototyping, accelerated testing and verification and validation (V&V) and its applicability as a simulation tool for additional CAV concepts, such as modeling edge cases like swarm behaviors for route delivery and vehicle cyber security testing on sensors. INTRODUCTION In this paper, we consider the validity of using a scalable vehicle platform for conducting hardwarein the loop (HIL) experimentation with respect to a virtual transportation model. The Scalable Testbed for Automated Robotic Systems (STARS) platform is designed to be a cost effective modeling and simulation tool combining physical and virtual testing to drive conclusions about Connected and Automated Vehicles\' (CAV) functionality. The STARS system consists of five physically identical remote controlled cars, modified with commercial off the shelf (COTS) electronics, and an external ground control station (GCS) for developing path planning modules. Initially, STARS was designed to test cybersecurity mitigation strategies of vehicle swarming patterns and tracking functions, but since it uses modular components, it was adapted to match distinct use cases for connected vehicle Proceedings of the 2018 Ground Vehicle Systems Engineering and Technology Symposium (GVSETS) Scaled testbeds for automated robotic systems Page 2 of 8 technology (e.g. platooning, lane changing, and lane keeping assistance) The advantage of this system lies in the modularity and scalability of vehicle data being collected: The experiment discussed in this paper highlights a small scaled test orchestrated to observe and record CAV behaviors to understand real world challenges in full sized vehicles. This combined small scale physical and virtual platform allows the project team to perform cost effective rapid verification and validation (V&V) of CAV functionalities and vehicle design features. The platform leverages prototype and simulationbased testing to generate analysis of frequent driving scenarios and edge cases not typically replicated in the real world. The objective of this research is to provide insight to manufacturers and certifiers on how they can use small scaled test beds like STARS to validate CAV behaviors and consider edge cases like swarm behaviors and vehicle cyber security mitigation techniques concepts that are becoming prominent to both the automotive and defense industry. BACKGROUND The focus of this paper is the experimentation and analysis of field testing a platooning scenario of an ""automated convoy,"" an application in which a group of automated vehicles follows a manually driven vehicle throughout a path, maintaining consistent speed and spacing. Figure 1: Automated Vehicles Demonstrating a Platooning Proof of Concept at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 2017 [1] The project team conducted a series of field tests in an isolated, controlled environment in which test vehicles demonstrated a platooning simulation built out in a transportation modeling tool for validation. By comparing simulated data with empirical field data, the project team analyzed performance metrics of both platooning scenarios to conclude V&V for small scale testing. Principles of modern control theory were used for developing simple control algorithms to compare the virtual and realworld model. As part of developing a methodology for STARS, the project team explored the use of HIL for scaled vehicle testing and V&V through a state of the art assessment of facilities and techniques used in the industry. Findings from this research of relevant HIL literature determined the following: HIL is already widely utilized in the automotive industry. HIL models consider many external factors to make each simulated model more accurate including gravity, resistance, and friction [2] A very low construction cost and short development cycle allow for testing variable conditions including road surface material, road geometry and slope, and static or dynamic obstacles [3] Embedding physical vehicle parts into a platform requires specialized space. The HIL method is highly reproducible and allows for flexibility in simulating realworld traffic operations. Small scale testing and HIL have been used by the automotive and defense industries, and both have been successfully implemented for V&V in the past. For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA) Vehicle Research Test Center (VRTC) has conducted HIL simulation for validating braking components for heavy trucks [4] It is evident that the application of HIL in STARS will allow the project team to remain agile and innovative as it addresses the Federal Government\'s evolving needs for CAV regulation. Proceedings of the 2018 Ground Vehicle Systems Engineering and Technology Symposium (GVSETS) Scaled testbeds for automated robotic systems Page 3 of 8 METHODOLOGY The validation of the STARS platform is conducted by comparing the scaled physical vehicle\'s path trajectory with simulated trajectories from VISSIM, an industry standard transportation simulation tool. The following diagram presents the steps in validation. Figure 2: Validation Process of STARS Project The experiment begins with user defined parameters: two vehicles (leader/follower) traveling in a straight path where the vehicle parameters are set to a default mid sized vehicle, measuring 4.92 feet wide by 15.62 feet long. Within the VISSIM simulation, an extended intelligent driver model (eIDM) was used to create an ideal scenario of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) which is a fundamental concept behind vehicle platooning used in commercial vehicles. A CACC illustration can be seen in Figure 3, where the follower vehicles\' speeds and distance can be observed.

In this article we discuss the first stage of an interdisciplinary project that brought together ethnographic and experimental user studies into trust in intelligent cars. This stage focused on the development of an interdisciplinary methodological framework for the user studies, through a review of 258 empirical HCI research articles on trust in automation and AVs. The review investigated the following research questions: a) what are the key themes in HCI methodologies used to research trust in automation and AVs; b) how do they account for trust in AVs as part of wider contexts; and c) how can these methodologies be developed to include more than momentary and individual human machine interactions. We found that while theoretical understandings of trust in automated technologies acknowledge the relevance of the wider context in which the interaction occurs, existing methodologies predominantly involve experimental studies in simulated environments with a focus on reliance related aspects of trust. We identified that ethnographic user studies can potentially contribute to new connections between theoretical understandings and conventional experimental methods.

Current encryption processes are no longer failsafe in secure data management architectures, especially with accessibility to Advanced Encryption Algorithms (AES) Through new technological advancements, including informational technology architectures and autonomous vehicle implementation, it is imperative to provide new paradigms of security against cybersecurity breaches. In all realms of data usage, including the development of the Next Generation of military vehicles, the demand for significant preventative measures in cybersecurity assurance has dramatically increased. The matter of advanced need in cybersecurity can be established through the use of MicroToken ExchangeTM (MTE) By way of MicroToken Exchange, it is possible to provide an additional robust layer of security that allows the right data, as well as ultrasecure command and control actions, to get to the right device, endpoint or End User Device (EUD) at the right time. Through MicroToken Exchange (MTE) operational changes are made to a sequence of digital data, which replaces the original data with new data or MicroTokens, prior to the streaming process; this process protects the data by replacing the real data with MicroTokens. By changing the data through the streaming process to MicroTokens rather than real data, the real data is then rendered inaccessible during the streaming process. When the MicroTokens reach their destination, they are then transformed for the device endpoint or EUD that the information was intended for to execute a command. This added transformation layer inhibits non authorized users to affect unauthorized actions to any paired End User Devices (EUDs) This process would provide the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps with optimized effectiveness, efficiency and security in systems processing with MTE. MTE can be deployed on a one to one, one to many, and/or many to many ecosystem. Compatibility of this process is compliant with C, C+ and Java platforms, with possibilities of translation for multiple languages. MTE makes command data exploitation unassailable, as systems and connected devices remain unscathed, fully operational, stable, and secure by preventing these vulnerabilities. It is both unique and unparalleled in its design architecture. This paper provides more details on the process and the possibilities aligned with MTE\'s applications. In providing these details, this paper further converses how MTE can provide cybersecurity assurance to informational technology aspects of the military. Also, how to integrate into the Next Generation vehicles for protection against cyber attacks and cyber warfare in autonomous systems. By providing these additional layers of security, MicroToken Exchange would support the mission of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps. This would prevent unauthorized user access to all information and all autonomous controls, by removing the real data that typically passes through the streaming process. Utilization of MTE would also coincide with the military goal of using more Unified Capabilities (UC) By preventing data collection from unauthorized users, vulnerabilities decrease dramatically, security increases exponentially, mission effectiveness increases dramatically, and safety of this nation\'s business and warfighter communities are preserved in the cyber realm. Introduction In a world of interconnectivity comes the new responsibility of safeguarding our information. Technology, the need for speed, as well as, the vulnerabilities within networks, continue to grow exponentially. The development of a new platform for cyber attacks and cyber warfare has complicated the dynamic of using these data networks in business and in warfighter communities. The typical solution for this thus far has been use of encryption and redblack engineering, which is traditionally followed by government and military information architect intervention. Due to the increased rates of speed and the multiplications of vulnerabilities these typical solutions are becoming less effective and less practical. These situations coupled with the ability to employ super computers on Advanced Encryption Algorithms (AES) and the perfect storm for cyber warfare suddenly exists. Combat vehicle prototypes are focused on leap ahead technologies to support the mission. Ground Vehicle Robotic mid term capabilities are set to improve the cybersecurity of unmanned systems. TARDEC Value Stream 1 Autonomy is one program that warrants 100% security need in its technological architecture. In this growth of technology, also comes the growth of responsible protection against cyber warfare attacks. Current data environments require data yet using the ""real"" data is no longer a secure option. Through MicroToken Exchange (MTE) Secure Data Management Architecture is protected from cyber activity. This process makes it possible to secure datain transit, changing the technological aspect of where vulnerabilities exist in information technology and autonomous systems. MicroToken ExchangeTM (MTE) MicroToken Exchange, (MTE) is a process for information security that consists of replacing a sequence of digital data from a data stream with a different sequence of digital data that has no relationship to the data that is replaced. In the case of data that is already encrypted, the process of MTE can still be applied as an additional layer of protection. Figure 1: The use of MicroToken Exchange communications between the Universal Controller and the paired EUD. Process is shown prior to the MicroToken Exchange from both end nodes. The following is an overview regarding its operation and how it works: Every send/receive command is authenticated and obfuscated, (No Encryption Req. MicroTokens execute preprogrammed commands, these commands are stored in paired libraries. MicroTokens can only be interpreted by paired devices. MicroTokens are instantly obsolete. Each time a command is execute the entire library of commands is re generated. Valid MicroTokens are hidden within complex digital chaff. The amount of chaff changes with each command so every packet has a different size. Pattern recognition is not possible due to its design. While there are additional layers within MTE, the solution makes sensitive command data invisible to hackers and cyberterrorists. MTE for data in motion began with the securing of commands to both connected and intelligent devices, including IoT devices. With the use of MTE, it is possible to secure data intransit, through enhanced capabilities that are agnostic to the type of Communication Protocol that is used to transmit information. By processing data through the MTE process, a new paradigm is created by removing the vulnerability that exists today with data in motion. These capabilities are eligible for use in transferring data commands and communications This process secures the commands, providing the user with an unequivocal layer of protection against cybersecurity breaches, including unauthorized actions. Operational Challenge Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication is a critical component of a connected vehicle environment a system of hardware, software, firmware and wireless communication that enables the dynamic transfer of data between vehicles as well as between vehicles and elements of the Joint Information Environment, (JIE) The greatest threat facing autonomy enable military vehicles is cybersecurity. TACOM TARDEC is developing Squad Maneuver Equipment Transport, (SMET) systems. Securing commands from the control device to the SMET over a wireless network is required for operational success. Current cybersecurity capabilities are at ""fail safe"" level. TARDEC is seeking enhanced security capabilities to achieve ""full/fail mission capable"" systems. By continuing to use typical cybersecurity options, there continues to be security risks and concerns for Automated Driving and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems, (ADAS) Through experimentation, it has been demonstrated that there are consequences of jamming and spoofing, exploiting underlying sensing principles. With very little effort, using simplistic tactics, bad actors can cause a great deal of harm and or destruction. Fig 2. Shows the Robotic and Autonomous system and their need for assured control. MTE and Army Digital Devices Military vehicles receive command inputs from many devices that need to control them, including satellites, handheld devices, other vehicles, thumb drives, and ground based installations. These command inputs need to be secured. The purpose of this Technical Paper is to present a Proof of Principle encompassing physical devices, software, protocol rules, and MTE proprietary software ""methods"" that provide significantly stronger cybersecurity to protect commands over existing communication networks. The systems viewpoint below presents the envisioned integration of MTE for test and evaluation at TRL 4 and rapidly maturing to TRL 6. Fig 3. High level pictorial of a system without MTE versus that of a system with MTE. EUDS Recent trends in military communications are driving the Army toward more diverse end user devices (EUDs) to perform more activities via Unified Capabilities (UC) UC are a suite of integrated voice, video and/or data services delivered ubiquitously across a secure and highly available network infrastructure, independent of technology, to increase mission effectiveness for the warfighter and business communities.1 Concurrently, Army commanders are requesting EUDs based on their assessments of mission requirements, raising demand for the devices themselves as well as the connectivity necessary to enable their use.

These affordable drugs are used for the treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from urinary tract infections to cancer. The anti pathogenic effect of clinical NFs occurs following a step wise process involving activation by azoreduction, followed by nitroreduction catalysed by azoreductases and nitroreductases (NTRs) respectively. Azoreduction yields stable metabolites that have the ability to covalently bind to cellular proteins. Nitroreduction, on the other hand, occurs by type I or II reduction of the nitro group in the presence of parasitic NADPH cytochrome P450 reductases. Type I NTRs catalyse, under anaerobic conditions, the reduction of NFs to produce anti pathogenic hydroxylamine. Under aerobic conditions, nitroreduction catalysed by type II NTRs produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) causing oxidative stress to pathogens and ultimate death. This multi activity nature of NFs thus allows the repurposing of these drugs from agricultural chemicals and basic antibiotics to efficient therapies against human life threatening diseases. Cases of NF resistance in pathogens are also limited likely due to this multi activity, as well as effectivity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, multi activity of these drugs can also infer toxicity. Molecular derivatisation is an effective strategy to improve efficacy, lower toxicity, diversify activity and address pathogen resistance associated with the use of these drugs.', 'corpus_id': 204833280, 'venue': 'European journal of pharmaceutical sciences official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Nonkululeko H Zuma', 'Janine Aucamp', ""David D N'Da""], 'n_citations': 11, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '208751802', 'title': 'Preparation and application of nitrofuran sensor in aquaculture water', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT The abuse of nitrofuran in aquaculture will lead to serious environmental pollution.

ABSTRACT The global spread of multidrug resistant enterobacteria warrants new strategies to combat these pathogens. One possible approach is the reconsideration of ""old"" antimicrobials, which remain effective after decades of use. Synthetic 5 nitrofurans such as furazolidone, nitrofurantoin, and nitrofurazone are such a class of antimicrobial drugs. Recent epidemiological data showed a very low prevalence of resistance to this antimicrobial class among clinical Escherichia coli isolates in various parts of the world, forecasting the increasing importance of its uses to battle antibiotic resistant enterobacteria. However, although they have had a long history of clinical use, a detailed understanding of the 5 nitrofurans\' mechanisms of action remains limited. Nitrofurans are known as prodrugs that are activated in E. coli by reduction catalyzed by two redundant nitroreductases, NfsA and NfsB. Furazolidone, nevertheless, retains relatively significant antibacterial activity in the nitroreductase deficient DnfsA DnfsB E. coli strain, indicating the presence of additional activating enzymes and/or antibacterial activity of the unreduced form. Using genome sequencing, genetic, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches, we discovered a novel 5 nitrofuran activating enzyme, AhpF, in E. coli. The discovery of a new nitrofuran reducing enzyme opens new avenues for overcoming 5 nitrofuran resistance, such as designing nitrofuran analogues with higher affinity for AhpF or screening for adjuvants that enhance AhpF expression.', 'corpus_id': 201831557, 'venue': 'Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Vuong Van Hung Le', 'Ieuan G Davies', 'Christina D Moon', 'Dave Wheeler', 'Patrick J Biggs', 'Jasna Rakonjac'], 'n_citations': 3, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '21334660', 'title': 'Accurate Quantitation and Analysis of Nitrofuran Metabolites, Chloramphenicol, and Florfenicol in Seafood by Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Method Validation and Regulatory Samples.', 'abstract': 'We developed and validated a method for the extraction, identification, and quantitation of four nitrofuran metabolites, 3 amino 2 oxazolidinone (AOZ) 3 amino 5 morpholinomethyl 2 oxazolidinone (AMOZ) semicarbazide (SC) and 1 aminohydantoin (AHD) as well as chloramphenicol and florfenicol in a variety of seafood commodities.

Immunoassays are the screening tool of choice for many testing laboratories due to their relative low cost, ease of use and high sensitivity.

Wind power also plays an important role by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus attenuating global warming. Another contribution of wind power generation is that it allows countries to diversify their energy mix, which is especially important in countries where hydropower is a large component. The expansion of wind power generation requires a robust understanding of its variability and thus how to reduce uncertainties associated with wind power output. Technical approaches such as simulation and forecasting provide better information to support the decision making process. This paper provides an overview of how the analysis of wind speed/energy has evolved over the last 30 years for decision making processes. For this, we employed an innovative and reproducible literature review approach called Systematic Literature Network Analysis (SLNA) The SLNA was performed considering 145 selected articles from peer reviewed journals and through them it was possible to identify the most representative approaches and future trends. Through this analysis, we identified that in the past 10 years, studies have focused on the use of Measure Correlate Predict (MCP) models, first using linear models and then improving them by applying density or kernel functions, as well as studies with alternative techniques, like neural networks or other hybrid models. An important finding is that most of the methods aim to assess wind power generation potential of target sites, and, in recent years the most used approaches are MCP and artificial neural network methods.', 'corpus_id': 159291307, 'venue': 'Journal of Cleaner Production', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Soraida Aguilar Vargas', 'Gheisa R T Esteves', 'Paula Medina Macaira', 'Bruno Q Bastos', 'Fernando Luiz Cyrino Oliveira', 'Reinaldo Castro Souza'], 'n_citations': 63, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '155921768', 'title': 'Seasonal forecasts of wind power generation', 'abstract': 'The energy sector is highly dependent on climate variability for electricity generation, maintenance activities and demand.

These constitute key factors for the realization of power mutual assistance and complementary dispatch of power generation in the broad area of renewable energy. However, owing to the large time scale of mid to long term prediction, the low accuracy of weather prediction, the limited data samples of historical power generation, and the significant difference between power generation prediction and short term power prediction, short term power prediction technology cannot be directly copied. Thus, the industry has not established yet an effective approach for mid to long term wind and photovoltaic power generation predictions. To solve these problems, this study proposed a method for the mid to long term wind and photovoltaic power generation prediction based on copula function and long short term memory network to achieve an effective extraction of the key meteorological factors that affect power generation owing to nonlinear effects and tendencies, and to deeply exploit the long term dependencies and tendencies from the limited available data samples. Therefore, the proposed approach is suitable for mid to long term wind and photovoltaic power generation prediction using limited data samples. Firstly, the non linear effects and tendency correlation measurements of the copula function were used to extract the key meteorological factors that influence wind and photovoltaic power generation. Secondly, independent wind/photovoltaic prediction models were established based on long short term memory network using the best input condition obtained by comparing these models to the persistence model. Additionally, the independent wind/photovoltaic models were further compared to support vector machine model with the optimal input condition. Thirdly, the joint prediction models of wind and photovoltaic power generation based on long short term memory network were established using different inputs. The persistence model and the support vector machine model were used as benchmarks to compare the elicited performances. Finally, the validity and applicability of the proposed approach were extensively evaluated using actual data from wind farms and photovoltaic power stations in China and the United States.

Compared with stochastic programming, this method may have less dependence on the data of exact probability distributions. It should also outperform the conventional robust optimization methods because some distribution information can be incorporated into the ambiguity sets to generate less conservative results. In this paper, the UC model is formulated based on the typical two stage framework, where the UC decisions are determined in a here and now manner, and the economic dispatch decisions are assumed to be wait and see, made after the observation of wind power outcomes. For computational tractability, the wait and see decisions are addressed by linear decision rule approximation, assuming that the economic dispatch decisions affinely depend on uncertain parameters as well as auxiliary random variables introduced to describe distributional characteristics of wind power generation. It is shown in case studies that this decision rule model tends to provide a tight approximation to the original two stage problem, and the performance of UC solutions may be greatly improved by incorporating information on wind power distributions into the robust model.', 'corpus_id': 35109988, 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Power Systems', 'year': 2017.0, 'author_names': ['Peng Xiong', 'Panida Jirutitijaroen', 'Chanan Singh'], 'n_citations': 170, 'n_key_citations': 7, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '38640163', 'title': 'Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation', 'abstract': 'Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature of wind.

Modelling the high share of renewable energy sources and in particular wind power crucially depends on the adequate representation of the intermittency and characteristics of the wind resource which is related to the accuracy of the approach in converting wind speed data into power values. One of the main factors contributing to the uncertainty in these conversion methods is the selection of the spatial resolution. Although numerical weather prediction models can simulate wind speeds at higher spatial resolution (up to 1x1km) than a reanalysis (generally, ranging from about 25km to 70km) they require high computational resources and massive storage systems: therefore, the most common alternative is to use the reanalysis data. However, local wind features could not be captured by the use of a reanalysis technique and could be translated into misinterpretations of the wind power peaks, ramping capacities, the behaviour of power prices, as well as bidding strategies for the electricity market. This study contributes to the understanding what is captured by different wind speeds spatial resolution datasets, the importance of using high resolution data for the conversion into power and the implications in power system analyses.

In this regard, uncertainty estimates are a promising direction to improve the robustness of automated segmentation systems. Different uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed, but little is known about their usefulness and limitations for brain tumor segmentation. In this study, we present an analysis of the most commonly used uncertainty estimation methods in regards to benefits and challenges for brain tumor segmentation. We evaluated their quality in terms of calibration, segmentation error localization, and segmentation failure detection. Our results show that the uncertainty methods are typically well calibrated when evaluated at the dataset level. Evaluated at the subject level, we found notable miscalibrations and limited segmentation error localization (e.g. for correcting segmentations) which hinder the direct use of the voxel wise uncertainties. Nevertheless, voxel wise uncertainty showed value to detect failed segmentations when uncertainty estimates are aggregated at the subject level.

The model cascade (MC) strategy, a popular scheme, significantly alleviates the class imbalance issue via running a set of individual deep models for coarse to fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however, this method leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation among the models. To handle these flaws in the MC approach, we propose in this paper a light weight deep model, i.e. the One pass Multi task Network (OM Net) to solve class imbalance better than MC does, while requiring only one pass computation for brain tumor segmentation. First, OM Net integrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists of shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task specific parameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively optimize OM Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design both an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning based training strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between tasks, which enables us to design a cross task guided attention (CGA) module. By following the guidance of the prediction results provided by the previous task, CGA can adaptively recalibrate channel wise feature responses based on the category specific statistics.

Surgery is the most commonly used treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially useful to assess gliomas and evaluate the success of the treatment in clinical practice. So accurately segmenting the brain tumor from MRI images is the key to clinical diagnostics and treatment planning. However, a large quantity of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time. So automatic approaches are required for quick and effective segmentation. But the spatial and structural variability among brain tumors bring a challenge to automatically segment MRI images. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) can achieve complex function mapping. This contributes to response to the challenge. Therefore, DCNN is the commonly used method in brain tumor segmentation. Although a large number of DCNN based methods have been proposed, these methods mainly aim to improve the quality of the image features extracted by DCNN. Actually, these methods usually ignore the prior knowledge in medical images, and the simple prior knowledge in brain tumor segmentation is that most of the tumor regions in images are left right asymmetry. Based on this, in this paper, a novel deep convolutional neural network which combines symmetry have been proposed to automatically segment brain tumors. Our neural networks, called Deep Convolutional Symmetric Neural Network (DCSNN) extends DCNN based segmentation networks by adding symmetric masks in several layers. Our proposal was validated in the BRATS 2015 database, and we also give some baselines.

How to rationally fuse the complementary information in PET/CT for accurate tumor segmentation is challenging. In this study, a novel deep learning based variational method was proposed to automatically fuse multimodality information for tumor segmentation in PET/CT. A 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) was first designed and trained to produce a probability map from the CT image. The learnt probability map describes the probability of each CT voxel belonging to the tumor or the background, and roughly distinguishes the tumor from its surrounding soft tissues. A fuzzy variational model was then proposed to incorporate the probability map and the PET intensity image for an accurate multimodality tumor segmentation, where the probability map acted as a membership degree prior.

The segmentation task is often done manually, making it tedious, labor intensive, and subject to intra /inter operator variations. While various algorithms for delineating organ at risks (OARs) and tumor targets have been proposed, automatic segmentation of livers and liver tumors remains intractable due to their low tissue contrast with respect to the surrounding organs and their deformable shape in CT images. The U Net has gained increasing popularity recently for image analysis tasks and has shown promising results. Conventional U Net architectures, however, suffer from three major drawbacks. First, skip connections allow for the duplicated transfer of low resolution information in feature maps to improve efficiency in learning, but this often leads to blurring of extracted image features. Secondly, high level features extracted by the network often do not contain enough high resolution edge information of the input, leading to greater uncertainty where high resolution edge dominantly affects the network's decisions such as liver and liver tumor segmentation. Thirdly, it is generally difficult to optimize the number of pooling operations in order to extract high level global features, since the number of pooling operations used depends on the object size. To cope with these problems, we added a residual path with deconvolution and activation operations to the skip connection of the U Net to avoid duplication of low resolution information of features. In the case of small object inputs, features in the skip connection are not incorporated with features in the residual path. Furthermore, the proposed architecture has additional convolution layers in the skip connection in order to extract high level global features of small object inputs as well as high level features of high resolution edge information of large object inputs.

Especially in terms of content caching, the cognitive engine can perceive the content requirements of users and match the content providers and content requesters to improve the caching hit rate. However, during this process, users may worry that their privacy data may be leaked. Content requesters need to submit data about points of interest in contents, which is part of their sensitive information. In addition, in terms of rapid speed of vehicles, the connection time is limited, such as vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to roadside unit (RSU) which leads to limited transaction time during obtaining contents. In order to solve these problems, in this article, we propose a blockchain based privacy aware content caching architecture in CIoV. In general, when vehicles need contents, in order to protect the privacy of vehicles, it is no longer necessary to submit a request to an RSU, but through broadcasting contents from an RSU or surrounding vehicles, where vehicles can selectively obtain contents. To improve the cache hit rate, the cognitive engine will perceive content requirements and recommend relevant content requirements to an RSU or content providing vehicles based on machine learning or deep learning methods. However, this method of content acquisition will connect different vehicles, which brings the untrusted problem. Both content requesters and providers may worry about untrusted users connected with them.

Therefore, trust establishment in IoV is a key security concern that is constantly limited by scalability challenges. This article proposes a blockchain based protocol for IoV using smart contracts, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) certificates, and a dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) consensus algorithm. The blockchain, in conjunction with contracts, provides a secure framework for registering trusted vehicles and blocking malicious ones. PUFs are used to assign a unique identity to each vehicle via which trust is established. Certificates are issued by roadside units that preserve the privacy of vehicles, whereas the dPoW consensus allows the protocol to scale according to the incoming traffic generated by the vehicles.

Nevertheless, the EV still needs to be authenticated to charging providers, which means some information will need to be provided anyway. While there have been many studies to address the problem of privacy preserving authentication for vehicular networks, such solutions will be void if charging payments are made through traditional means. In this paper, we tackle this problem by utilizing distributed applications enabled by Blockchain and smart contracts.

Compared with circumpolar and temperate lakes, the responses of subtropical montane lakes to these external stressors have been less investigated. Here we present sedimentary multi proxies records (i.e. chironomids, elements and stable isotope of carbon and nitrogen) in 210Pb dated cores from two montane ponds (central China) Before the 1900s, low biomass and the dominance of opportunistic species (e.g. Chironomus anthracinus type) in both ponds might be in response to cold and harsh condition. Thereafter, chironomid communities in both ponds experienced pronounced shifts. Nutrient tolerant/warm adapted species (e.g. Chironomus sp. Polypedilum nubeculosum type and Endochironomus impar type) proliferated and biomass increased synchronously after the 1900s, suggestive of favorable condition for chironomid growth. Redundancy analyses revealed that changes in chironomid communities in both ponds were significantly correlated with rising temperature and d15N depletion. Prolonged growing season and nitrogen subsidy would increase primary productivity, and hence enhancing food availability for chironomids. Catchment mediated indirect effects of warming and nitrogen deposition, such as hydrological changes and terrestrial organic matter inputs, would impose further influences on chironomid communities.

However, the relative increases in biomass, height and diameter of invasive S. canadensis were significantly lower than those of native A. argyi.

Treatments consisting of temperature increase, nitrogen addition, temperature increase combined with nitrogen addition, and controls were conducted on the D. angustifolia communities with three encroachment levels (low, medium, and high levels) Results showed that 1) D. angustifolia grew in response to added nutrients but did not grow well when temperature increased. R. chrysanthum showed negligible responses to the simulated environmental changes. 2) Compared to R. chrysanthum, D. angustifolia could effectively occupy the above ground space by increasing tillers and growing rapidly by efficiently using nitrogen. The difference in nitrogen uptake abilities between the two species contributed to expansion of D. angustifolia. 3) D. angustifolia encroachment could deeply change the biodiversity of tundra vegetation and may eventually result in the replacement of native biota, especially with nitrogen addition.

Although multiple multi factor proposals are seen in literature, the absence of a method that allows a proper comparison and selection of these authentication methods, based on an application's security requirements, can be observed. Existing frameworks for the analysis of authentication methods have been identified through the realization of a systematic literature review, but most of these focus on specific contexts and do not provide a generic enough solution. Due to the above, this research focuses on the creation of a recommendation framework that guides in the comparison and selection of single and multi factor authentication schemes, considering both the application's requirements and its context. This has been attained not only through the knowledge found in literature, but the experience from industry experts has been compiled as well through the collaboration with a multinational software development company. Consequently, the knowledge found in literature has been obtained from a systematic literature review, whereas the experience from industry experts was obtained through a survey and interviews.

Besides these standards that are giving guidelines regarding security, there are many other sources like books, blogs, news, trainings and courses that produce security recommendations, there are regulations that mandate awareness about security, but still, organisations are missing appropriate knowledge and their systems are often attacked and breached. Having all these means available at a click of a mouse, it is questionable how can we use them in order to find the right solution that generates appropriate behaviour. This paper intends to tackle this problem by formulating a proposal for a methodology to setup a hybrid security knowledge repository for enterprise systems. The proposed solution will enable various stakeholders to add/share security knowledge in/from a repository and at the same time can use external trusted security data (from collaborative partners or reliable organisations) to enrich this knowledge base via semantic inter operability techniques. Combining various online sources with knowledge from security officers would enable inferring new insights. The security knowledge holds some key characteristics that are considered as imperative. We referred to these as the 5C: Complexity, Continuity, Comprehensive and Cross organisations, Compliance and Common representation. Our approach is making use of a common representation based on semantic technology for describing both security requirements pertaining to an organisation and trusted external security data.', 'corpus_id': 49650761, 'venue': '2018 12th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)', 'year': 2018.0, 'author_names': ['Ana-Maria Ghiran', 'Robert Andrei Buchmann'], 'n_citations': 0, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '29177816', 'title': 'IT Governance Frameworks and COBIT A Literature Review', 'abstract': ""IT governance is one of the central areas of IS research.

Adverse consequences related to problem gambling are well known, but few studies have analyzed gambling related harm in detail in general population samples. We determined the extent and distribution of gambling harm in Finland, as assessed by the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and analyzed gambling involvement, demographics and their association with various types of harm. METHODS A nationwide telephone survey was conducted among 4484 Finns aged 15 74 years in 2011 12. Gambling related harms were based on the nine item PGSI. Gambling involvement was measured by gambling frequency and weekly average gambling expenditure. Associations among harms, demographics and gambling involvement were examined in logistic regression. RESULTS During the previous year, 13% of respondents experienced at least one gambling related harm (males 18.1% females 7.2% The four commonest harms were 'chasing losses' (8.6% 'escalating gambling to maintain excitement' (3.1% 'betting more than could afford to lose' (2.8% and 'feeling guilty' (2.6% The harm profile in descending order was the same for both genders but differed in prevalence. Young age <25 years) was associated with increased likelihood of reporting harms. Both monthly and weekly gambling and spending over EUR21 per week on gambling were related to the harms.

The PGSI is therefore weak in assessing low to moderate problem severity, a notable limitation of most brief gambling screens.

In this paper, we set to address these issues from the following two aspects: (1) to develop novel deep learning based visual food recognition algorithms to achieve the best in class recognition accuracy; (2) to design a food recognition system employing edge computing based service computing paradigm to overcome some inherent problems of traditional mobile cloud computing paradigm, such as unacceptable system latency and low battery life of mobile devices. We have conducted extensive experiments with real world data. Our results have shown that the proposed system achieved three objectives: (1) outperforming existing work in terms of food recognition accuracy; (2) reducing response time that is equivalent to the minimum of the existing approaches; and (3) lowering energy consumption which is close to the minimum of the state of the art.', 'corpus_id': 4712140, 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Services Computing', 'year': 2018.0, 'author_names': ['Chang Liu', 'Yu Cao', 'Yan Luo', 'Guanling Chen', 'Vinod Vokkarane', 'Ma Yunsheng', 'Songqing Chen', 'Peng Hou'], 'n_citations': 154, 'n_key_citations': 8, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '56895278', 'title': 'Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network Based Food Recognition Using Partially Labeled Data', 'abstract': 'Traditional machine learning algorithms using hand crafted feature extraction techniques (such as local binary pattern) have limited accuracy because of high variation in images of the same class (or intraclass variation) for food recognition tasks. In recent works, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to this task with better results than all previously reported methods. However, they perform best when trained with large amount of annotated (labeled) food images. This is problematic when obtained in large volume, because they are expensive, laborious, and impractical. This article aims at developing an efficient deep CNN learning based method for food recognition alleviating these limitations by using partially labeled training data on generative adversarial networks (GANs) We make new enhancements to the unsupervised training architecture introduced by Goodfellow et al. which was originally aimed at generating new data by sampling a dataset. In this article, we make modifications to deep convolutional GANs to make them robust and efficient for classifying food images.

Taking inspiration from Adversarial Erasing, a strategy that progressively discovers discriminative object regions for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, we propose a novel network architecture in which a primary network maintains the base accuracy of classifying an input image, an auxiliary network adversarially mines discriminative food regions, and a region network classifies the resulting mined regions. The global (the original input image) and the local (the mined regions) representations are then integrated for the final prediction. The proposed architecture denoted as PAR Net is end to end trainable, and highlights discriminative regions in an online fashion. In addition, we introduce a new fine grained food dataset named as Sushi 50, which consists of 50 different sushi categories. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed approach.

METHODS Mandibles from both control (Acvr1 fx/ Osterix Cre and cKO (Acvr1 fx/ Osterix Cre mice at postnatal day 21 (PN21) were scanned by micro CT, followed by decalcification and histological observations. Distributions and levels of differentiation markers of fibroblasts, osteoblasts and cementocytes in the periodontium were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. RESULTS Micro CT results showed that bone mass and bone mineral density of the alveolar bones in the cKO mice were lower than those in the controls. Histomorphometry within the alveolar bones revealed that the lower bone mass observed in the cKO mice was caused by increased numbers and resorption activities of osteoclasts. The markers for osteoblast differentiation, Col I and DMP1, were reduced and the signals of the RANKL/OPG ratio were increased in the alveolar bones of the cKO mice compared to those of the control mice. The periodontal ligament in the cKO mice exhibited disorganized collagen fibers with weaker signals of Col I and periostin. However, there was no difference in terms of the cellular cementum between the two groups. CONCLUSION ACVR1 is essential for normal periodontium development.

RESULTS Results: Administering EGCG reduced the content of FHP by 33.3 (p<0.01) the content of GAGs by 39.4% (p<0.02) and content of NANA by 34.3% (p<0.001) in the soft periodontal tissues compared with the relevant findings in the second group of the animals. In this condition the concentration of these compounds in the calcified components of periodontium (alveolar bone) lowered as well: FHP by 41.9% (p<0.001) GAGs by 41.0% (p<0.001) NANA by 53.3% (p<0.001) MREI reduced to 27.1+1.6, i.e. by 27.7% (p<0.01) compared with the relevant findings in the second group of the animals. The administration of EGCG also reduced the content of FHP by 37.8% (p<0.001) the content of GAGs by 39.8% (p<0.001) and the content of NANA by 37.6% (p<0.001) in SG tissues compared with the relevant results of the second group of the animals. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The administration of EGCG under modeled systemic inflammation is an effective means of preventing and correcting the disruption of connective tissue of periodontium and submandibular salivary glands in rats: it reduces collagenolysis and depolymerization of proteoglycans and glycoproteins.', 'corpus_id': 51969390, 'venue': 'Wiadomosci lekarskie', 'year': 2018.0, 'author_names': [""A M Yelins'ka"", ""Olena O Shvaykovs'ka"", 'Vitalii O Kostenko'], 'n_citations': 4, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '3787616', 'title': 'Tissue specific composite cell aggregates drive periodontium tissue regeneration by reconstructing a regenerative microenvironment', 'abstract': 'Periodontitis is the most common cause of periodontium destruction. Regeneration of damaged tissue is the expected treatment goal. However, the regeneration of a functional periodontal ligament (PDL) insertion remains a difficulty, due to complicated factors. Recently, periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been shown to participate in PDL regeneration, both pathologically and physiologically. Besides, interactions affect the biofunctions of different derived cells during the regenerative process. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to discuss the different derived composite cell aggregate (CA) systems of PDLSCs and BMMSCs (iliac derived or jaw derived) for periodontium regeneration under regenerative microenvironment reconstruction. Our results showed although all three mono MSC CAs were compacted and the cells arranged regularly in them, jaw derived BMMSC (JBMMSC) CAs secreted more extracellular matrix than the others. Furthermore, PDLSC/JBMMSC compound CAs highly expressed ALP, Col I, fibronectin, integrin b1 and periostin, suggesting that their biofunction is more appropriate for periodontal structure regeneration. Inspiringly, PDLSC/JBMMSC compound CAs regenerated more functional PDL like tissue insertions in both nude mice ectopic and minipig orthotopic transplantation. The results indicated that the different derived CAs of PDLSCs/JBMMSCs provided an appropriate regenerative microenvironment facilitating a more stable and regular regeneration of functional periodontium tissue. This method may provide a possible strategy to solve periodontium defects in periodontitis and powerful experimental evidence for clinical applications in the future.

Frozen shoulder is a disabling disorder involving glenohumeral pain and loss of motion.

This gives rise to the need to understand the underlying causes and management of the disorder. Although, findings from literature are inconclusive, shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises have been recorded to be effective in the management of frozen shoulder. Mrs. B. is a 54year old woman who was diagnosed of (L) frozen shoulder and presented at physiotherapy clinic (out patient department) for physiotherapy. Prior to the diagnosis, she presented with four months' history of painful and restricted active and passive glenohumeral joint range of motion. The range of motion of the (L) shoulder was limited in all direct ions on examination. Shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises were introduced after thorough examination. After six weeks of shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises, patient recorded a remarkable improvement in pain and range of motion of the (L) shoulder. Findings from this study showed that shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises are effective in the management of frozen shoulder as they showed a remarkable improvement in pain and range of motion after six weeks of both therapies. Other studies have also recorded the effectiveness of shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises in the management of frozen shoulder. Supervised active exercises help to increase the range of motion and relieve pain while shortwave diathermy relieves pain and improves tissue extensibility. The preference for shortwave diathermy over other electrotherapy modalities in this study is because it is effective in management of deep rooted pains and it covers a large area of skin. The study showed that shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises increase the rate of frozen shoulder resolution. However, a wider study involving many patients should be carried out to further ascertain the efficacy of shortwave diathermy and supervised active exercises in the management of frozen shoulder as used in this study as the outcome on one patient may not be adequate to generalize their effectiveness to the wider population.

Since there currently lack methods particularly for UDA instance segmentation, we first design a Domain Adaptive Mask R CNN (DAM) as the baseline, with cross domain feature alignment at the image and instance levels. In addition to the image and instance level domain discrepancy, there also exists domain bias at the semantic level in the contextual information. Next, we, therefore, design a semantic segmentation branch with a domain discriminator to bridge the domain gap at the contextual level. By integrating the semantic and instance level feature adaptation, our method aligns the cross domain features at the panoptic level. Third, we propose a task re weighting mechanism to assign trade off weights for the detection and segmentation loss functions. The task re weighting mechanism solves the domain bias issue by alleviating the task learning for some iterations when the features contain source specific factors. Furthermore, we design a feature similarity maximization mechanism to facilitate instance level feature adaptation from the perspective of representational learning. Different from the typical feature alignment methods, our feature similarity maximization mechanism separates the domain invariant and domain specific features by enlarging their feature distribution dependency.

However, most Siamese network based trackers (SNTs) are tailored to best match the canonical posture of the template and the search region images, resulting in inferior performance when the target objects have large scale pose variations. Besides, SNTs fail to discriminate distractors well because they only leverage high level semantic features as target representations that cannot well tell from different targets of the same category. To address these issues, this paper presents an efficient and effective SNT that is based on feature alignment and aggregation networks. Specifically, we first design an effective feature alignment network module to calibrate the search region image. This module results in a more reliable matching response that is robust to severe target pose variations. Then, we develop an effective shallow level and high level feature aggregation network module to complement the feature characteristics, making the learned feature representation not only well differentiate the target from distractors, but also robust to target appearance variations. Afterwards, we employ a channel attention mechanism to further strengthen the discriminative capability of the aggregated feature representation.

Therefore, we propose a novel Joint Pixel and Feature Alignment (JPFA) framework for such cross dataset palmprint recognition scenarios.

Point of care tests not requiring laboratory support will speed diagnosis and protect health care staff. We studied the feasibility of using breath analysis to distinguish these conditions with near patient gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry (GC IMS) Methods Independent observational prevalence studies at Edinburgh, UK, and Dortmund, Germany, recruited adult patients with possible COVID 19 at hospital presentation. Participants gave a single breath sample for VOC analysis by GC IMS. COVID 19 infection was identified by transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) of oral/nasal swabs together with clinical review. Following correction for environmental contaminants, potential COVID 19 breath biomarkers were identified by multi variate analysis and comparison to GC IMS databases.

In this study, we compare the results of hyperspectral Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging analysis and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py GC/MS) analysis performed on a set of environmental samples that differ in complexity and degree of microplastic contamination. The measurements were conducted consecutively, and on exactly the same sample. First, the samples were investigated with FTIR using aluminum oxide filters; subsequently, these were crushed, transferred to glass fiber filters, in pyrolysis cups, and measured via Py GC/MS. After a general data harmonization step, the trends in MP contamination were thoroughly investigated with regard to the respective sample set and the derived polymer compositions. While the overall trends in MP contamination were very similar, differences were observed in the polymer compositions. Furthermore, polymer masses were empirically calculated from FTIR data and compared with the Py GC/MS results. Here, a most plausible shape related overestimation of the calculated polymer masses was observed in samples with larger particles and increased particle numbers. Taking into account the different measurement principles of both methods, all results were examined and discussed, and future needs for harmonization of intermethodological results were identified and highlighted.

The main advantage of such media lies in the speed of information creation and dissemination. This, on the other hand, inevitably adds pressure, accelerating editorial work, fact checking, and the scrutiny of source credibility. In this chapter, an overview of computer supported approaches to detecting disinformation and manipulative techniques based on several criteria is presented. We concentrate on the technical aspects of automatic methods which support fact checking, topic identification, text style analysis, or message filtering on social media channels. Most of the techniques employ artificial intelligence and machine learning with feature extraction combining available information resources.

On the positive side, this has given rise to citizen journalism, thus enabling much faster dissemination of information compared to what was possible with newspapers, radio, and TV. On the negative side, stripping traditional media from their gate keeping role has left the public unprotected against the spread of disinformation, which could now travel at breaking news speed over the same democratic channel. This situation gave rise to the proliferation of false information, specifically created to affect individual people\'s beliefs, and ultimately to influence major events such as political elections; it also set the dawn of the Post Truth Era, where appeal to emotions has become more important than the truth. More recently, with the emergence of the COVID 19 pandemic, a new blending of medical and political misinformation and disinformation has given rise to the first global infodemic. Limiting the impact of these negative developments has become a major focus for journalists, social media companies, and regulatory authorities. We offer an overview of the emerging and inter connected research areas of fact checking, misinformation, disinformation, ""fake news\' propaganda, and media bias detection, with focus on text and computational approaches.

Iosifidis and Nicoli\'s concise and timely volume is suffused by a sense of urgency at the ways in which digital disinformation is eroding democracy, trust, and informed participation, even in countries that they argue to have been historically aligned with enlightenment ideals and liberal political traditions.

However, trace element analysis of keratinized tissues is complicated by the lack of reference endogenous ranges of trace element and the lack of understanding of the susceptibility of each element to exogenous contamination. The interior of animal horn is the cleanest of all keratinized tissues with minimum exogenous contamination because of its large size. Thus, the trace element concentrations in horn interior samples can provide reliable endogenous concentration ranges. Here we measured the concentrations of trace elements in horn interior samples of cattle and wild animals, which we propose to be used as the reference ranges for endogenous levels of trace elements in keratin. We calculated the enrichment factors of 30 trace elements in horn interior samples relative to the continental crust, which we considered the average exogenous contamination. We compared the ranges of elemental concentrations measured in horn interior samples, in the order of decreasing enrichment factor, to their reference ranges in hair, fingernails, and toenails, as well as their concentrations in caprine horns.

Thus, by improving our understanding of alterations to trace mineral homeostasis in the presence of stress it may be possible to develop strategic trace mineral supplementation strategies to improve animal efficiency.

Archeozoological and genetic data indicate that cattle were first domesticated from wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) approximately 10,500 years ago. Bovine fertility is affected by nutritional and non nutritional factors. The non nutritional factors include micro climate of the stable, lay out of the stable, hygiene and genetic manipulations. The most common cause of infertility in cattle is poor nutrition (Navarre et al. 2010) Minerals have a great impact on animal's reproductive physiology. Their imbalance causes various problems leading to lowered reproductive efficiency and resultant monetary loss to the dairy industry. Adequate micro minerals supplementation is required as most of the roughages, greens, concentrates and even most of commercial feeds available to Indian market are deficient in trace mineral elements. Often, correcting an imbalance in mineral levels can solve the nagging problem of infertility by improving reproductive performance and health with little additional cost (Kumar et al. 2011) The main source of vitamin A for ruminants is B carotene which is available in abundant quantities from green foliage. In the intestinal mucosa, B carotene is converted to vitamin A. The importance of B carotene had been viewed solely as a source of vitamin A until 1955. Since then, stabilized vitamin A has become available for use in animal feeds and research has extended into the comparison between vitamin A and B carotene. It was not until the 1970s that B carotene was suspected to have effects independent of its role as a vitamin A precursor in bovine reproduction. The present study shows total 24 infertile crossbred cows were selected to induce oestrus taken for correction of an oestrosity with bcarotene incorporated vitamin permix. Total 8 out of 24 animals exhibited oestrus symptom after the treatment. Among the animals received b carotene incorporated vitamin permix (treatment group) 50% showed the oestrus symptoms.

Methodology: Five brands of sachet water commonly consumed by the people living in Eligbolo Community of Port Harcourt, Nigeria were purchased from different Vendors in the community. Nutrient and MacConkey agar plates were used for culturing of water samples using spread plate method. Ten fold serial dilution and Most Probable Number (MPN) were among the methods used and the samples analyzed were according to standard procedures. Natural honey purchased from Ogbokolo in Benue State, Nigeria was used for susceptibility testing. Quality control, ant inhibition and water test methods were performed using the honey to confirm its originality before use. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing was done using the agar well diffusion method. Results: Results obtained showed the bacterial isolated from the 5 sachet brands of water. These include Bacillus species 5 (62.5% Enterococcus faecalis 1 (12.5% Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 (12.5% and Escherichia coli 1 (12.5% All of the 5 sachet water samples analyzed failed to meet the WHO drinking water standard of zero coliform per 100 ml making them unsuitable for Original Research Article Agi et al.

Engagement with this challenge has the potential to lead to the provision of interfaces that allow students to access these resources and become independent learners. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate the features of such interfaces to calibrate and respond to individual student needs. In this context, the quality of differentiated support for learning, referred to as scaffolding, is established as paramount to the design and structure of online environments. In this study, the instructional design referred to as predict, observe, explain and evaluate (POEE) informed by constructivist theories of learning, to implement multiple scaffolding strategies is described. The POEE scaffolding strategy was applied in the creation of two inquiry learning modules. Student engagement with these inquiry modules in a self directed online environment was explored to identify critical elements of the scaffolding. The findings of this study, based on students' interactions and engagement with the learning modules, enabled the conceptualisation of a multimodal scaffolding strategy for self directed inquiry.

The purpose of the present article is novel and examines whether the consideration of modes of learning (instruction, performance, and inquiry) could assist in the design of adult education that facilitates self directed learning and enables learners to think and perform adaptively. The concept of modes of learning originated from the typology of Houle. However, to date, no study has reached beyond this typology, especially concerning the potential of using modes of learning in the design of adult education. Specifically, an apparent oversight in adult learning theory is the foremost importance of the consideration of whether inquiry is included in the learning process: its inclusion potentially differentiates the purpose of instruction, the nature of learners' performance, and the underlying epistemological positioning. To redress this concern, two models of modes of learning are proposed and contrasted. The reinforcing model of modes of learning (instruction, performance, without inquiry) promotes teacher directed learning. A key consequence of employing this model in adult education is that learners may become accustomed to habitually reinforcing patterns of perceiving, thinking, judging, feeling, and acting performance that may be rather inflexible and represented by a distinct lack of a perceived need to adapt to social contextual changes: a lack of motivation for self directed learning. Rather, the adapting model of modes of learning (instruction, performance, with inquiry) may facilitate learners to be adaptive in their performance by encouraging an enhanced learner sensitivity toward changing social contextual conditions: potentially enhancing learners' motivation for self directed learning."", 'corpus_id': 150150701, 'venue': '', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Thomas Howard Morris'], 'n_citations': 24, 'n_key_citations': 5, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '150712744', 'title': 'Teacher directed learning to self directed learning transition barriers in Pakistan', 'abstract': ""Abstract Present paper explores the implications and barriers associated with the transition from teacher directed learning (TDL) to self directed learning (SDL) in the EFL classroom in Pakistan.

This study sought to explore the perspectives of adult learners around the effect of digital and mobile technologies on continuing professional education activities. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 55 adult learners from four professional groups (9 physicians; 20 nurses; 4 pharmacists; 22 social workers) Key thematic categories included perceptions of self directed learning, self directed learning resources, key triggers, and barriers to undertaking self directed learning. Digital and mobile technologies emerged as important resources supporting the self directed learning of health and human services professionals. Increasing usage and dependency on these technologies has important implications for organizational and workplace policies that can support effective self directed learning processes in a digital age.

The theory fell naturally out of the non Walrasian treatment there of the labor ""market"" as operating imperfectly because of the scarcity of information about the existence and characteristics of workers and jobs. A paradigm for the theory is the traveller in a strange town faced with choosing between dinner at the hotel and dinner somewhere in the town. If he makes it a rule to dine outside the hotel without any prior investigation, he is said to be discriminating against the hotel. Though there will be instances where the hotel cuisine would have been preferable, the rule represents rational behavior it maximizes expected utilityif the cost of acquiring evaluations of restaurants is sufficiently high and if the hotel restaurant is believed to be inferior at least half the time. In the same way, the employer who seeks to maximize expected profit will discriminate against blacks or women if he believes them to be less qualified, reliable, long term, etc. on the average than whites and men, respectively, and if the cost of gaining information about the individual applicants is excessive. Skin color or sex is taken as a proxy for relevant data not sampled. The a priori belief in the probable preferability of a white or a male over a black or female candidate who is not known to differ in other respects might stem from the employer\'s previous statistical experience with the two groups (members from the less favored groups might have been, and continue to be, hired at less favorable terms) or it might stem from prevailing sociological beliefs that blacks and women grow up disadvantaged due to racial hostility or at least prejudices toward them in the society (in which latter case the discrimination is self perpetuating) The theory is applicable to the class of ""liberal"" employers and workers who have no distaste for hiring and working alongside black or female workers. By contrast, the theory of discrimination originated by Gary Becker is based on the factor of racial taste. The pioneering work of Gunnar Myrdal et al. also appears to center on racial (and, in an appendix, sexual) antagonism. Some indications of interest in the new theory, and the independent discovery of the same statistical theoryby Kenneth Arrow, convince me that it is time for a formalization of the theory in terms of an exact statistical model. Though what follows is very simple, it may be useful to those who like exact models and it may stimulate others to develop the theory further. An employer samples from a population of job applicants.

Anopheles arabiensis and A. coluzzii in Africa, A. darlingi in South America and A. farauti in Oceania, as well as A. culicifacies species E, A. fluviatilis species S, A. lesteri and A. minimus in Asia, all feed readily on either humans or animals and collectively mediate residual malaria transmission across most of the tropics. Eliminating malaria transmission by vectors exhibiting such dual host preferences will require aggressive mosquito population abatement, rather than just personal protection of humans. Population suppression of even these particularly troublesome vectors is achievable with a variety of existing vector control technologies that remain underdeveloped or underexploited.', 'corpus_id': 33399994, 'venue': 'BMJ Global Health', 'year': 2017.0, 'author_names': ['Gerry F Killeen', 'Samson S Kiware', 'Fredros O Okumu', 'Marianne Sinka', 'Catherine L Moyes', 'Noelle Massey', 'Peter W Gething', 'John M Marshall', 'Carlos J Chaccour', 'Lucy S Tusting'], 'n_citations': 41, 'n_key_citations': 7, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '73414413', 'title': 'Plant extracts for developing mosquito larvicides: From laboratory to the field, with insights on the modes of action.', 'abstract': 'In the last decades, major research efforts have been done to investigate the insecticidal activity of plant based products against mosquitoes. This is a modern and timely challenge in parasitology, aimed to reduce the frequent overuse of synthetic pesticides boosting resistance development in mosquitoes and causing serious threats to human health and environment. This review covers the huge amount of literature available on plant extracts tested as mosquito larvicides, particularly aqueous and alcoholic ones, due to their easy formulation in water without using surfactants. We analysed results obtained on more than 400 plant species, outlining that 29 of them have outstanding larvicidal activity (i.e. LC50 values below 10 ppm) against major vectors belonging to the genera Anopheles, Aedes and Culex, among others. Furthermore, synergistic and antagonistic effects between plant extracts and conventional pesticides, as well as among selected plant extracts are discussed. The efficacy of pure compounds isolated from the most effective plant extracts and when available their mechanism of action, as well as the impact on non target species, is also covered. These belong to the following class of secondary metabolites: alkaloids, alkamides, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, sterols, flavonoids, coumarins, anthraquinones, xanthones, acetogenonins and aliphatics. Their mode of action on mosquito larvae ranges from neurotoxic effects to inhibition of detoxificant enzymes and larval development and/or midugut damages. In the final section, current drawbacks as well as key challenges for future research, including technologies to synergize efficacy and improve stability thus field performances of the selected plant extracts, are outlined. Unfortunately, despite the huge amount of laboratory evidences about their efficacy, only a limited number of studies was aimed to validate their efficacy in the field, nor the epidemiological impact potentially arising from these vector control operations has been assessed. This strongly limits the development of commercial mosquito larvicides of botanical origin, at variance with plant borne products developed in the latest decades to kill or repel other key arthropod species of medical and veterinary importance (e.g. ticks and lice) as well as mosquito adults.

Unsubsidised PV markets may start to take off in 2013, fuelling substantial growth where PV power is getting cheaper than grid or diesel backup electricity for commercial consumers. Managing loads and achieving a good match between power consumption and weather dependent power production will likely become a key issue. This consumption production balance may trigger massive innovation and investment in energy management technologies involving different kinds of storage and controls. Increasing autonomy and flexibility of consumers challenges the top down control logic of traditional power supply and pushes for a more decentralised and multi layered system.

Why has this shift occurred? This paper proposes investor specific cost of capital as an important explanatory factor. We argue that fuel cost free renewable energy projects with guaranteed feed in tariffs, such as wind and solar power generation, offer a lower risk and lower return opportunity that is systematically undervalued by investors with high cost of capital, such as incumbent utilities. The behavior and preferences of renewable energy investors has been researched through different lenses, including path dependency (Unruh, 2002; Wustenhagen and Teppo, 2006) dynamic capabilities (e.g. Stenzel and Frenzel, 2008) behavioral economics and microeconomics (e.g. Kaenzig and Wustenhagen, 2010) and through a cognitive lens (Chassot et al. 2013) Nonetheless, the drivers and motives of investors remain largely open (Masini and Menichetti, 2012; Wustenhagen and Menichetti, 2012; Bergek et. al. 2013) A considerable stream of literature indicates differences among investors in terms of motives, resources, or previous experience influencing investment behavior and decisions, but little empirical evidence exists (Bergek et al. 2013) This is particularly true for differing financial characteristics and motives (Langniss, 1996; Dinica, 2006; Bergek et al. 2013) which will be the scope of this study. A standard economic perspective is reasonable to analyze renewable energy investments and investors, as the energy sector can be regarded as a business context ""dominated by highly rational and well informed investors"" (Masini and Menichetti, 2012) Available studies in this field are mostly focusing on comparisons of renewable energies with conventional power generation (Awerbuch, 2003; Soderholm et al. 2007; Bergek et al. 2013) or between different types of renewable energies (Munoz et al. 2009; Delmas and MontesSancho, 2011; Bergek et al. 2013) but may also contribute to understand investment decision processes by different investor groups. The most common instrument for investment analysis is the net present value (NPV) calculation, and the cost of capital a crucial variable for the valuation outcome (Ryan and Ryan, 2002; Titman and Martin, 2008) Considering differences among investors in terms of their cost of capital, and the different financial attributes of renewable energies and conventional power generation, we derive our research question: how does the cost of capital of different investor groups influence their renewable energy investment decisions? We derive a theoretical model, illustrating how previous investment activities shape capital costs of investors in the energy sector, and how these capital costs influence choice on renewable energies and other investment opportunities. We demonstrate the role of cost based valuation methods, often applied in the energy industry. Thereby, we challenge existing views, which primarily consider higher technological and regulatory risks as a major barrier for investors to support a large scale diffusion of renewable energies.', 'corpus_id': 157667295, 'venue': '', 'year': 2014.0, 'author_names': ['Sarah Salm', 'Rolf Wuestenhagen', 'Thorsten Helms'], 'n_citations': 1, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '196701402', 'title': 'Progress towards Sustainable Regional Development: Results form the EU Research Programme on Human Dimensions of Environmental Change', 'abstract': '', 'corpus_id': 196701402, 'venue': '', 'year': None, 'author_names': ['Ruggero Schleicher-Tappeser'], 'n_citations': 3, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '201682503', 'title': 'The Alpine Space as a Sustainable Business Location', 'abstract': '(c) Lou Hagbarth, October 2007 All rights reserved.

However, the use and adoption of these technologies may bring about potentially undesirable consequences, such as exercises of power. This paper will analyse Brey's five distinctions of power relationships (manipulative, seductive, leadership, coercive, and forceful power) and apply them to the use agricultural Big Data. It will be shown that ABDA can be used as a form of manipulative power to initiate cheap land grabs and acquisitions. Seductive power can be exercised by pressuring farmers into situations they would not have otherwise chosen (such as installing monitors around their farm and limited access to their farm and machinery) It will be shown that agricultural technology providers (ATPs) demonstrate leadership power by getting farmers to agree to use ABDA without informed consent.

Moreover, some of the features that are significantly correlated with default rates are not attached importance in the model construction of previous studies. To fill these gaps, we propose a distance to model and adaptive clustering based multi view ensemble (DM ACME) learning method for predicting default risk in P2P lending. In this method, multi view learning and an adaptive clustering method are explored to produce an ensemble of diverse ensembles constituted by gradient boosting decision trees. A novel combination strategy called distance to model and a soft probability fashion are embedded for model integration.

In this paper, we propose a new multi view clustering method that integrates deep matrix factorization, low rank subspace learning, and multiple subspace ensemble in a unified framework, which we term as the Deep Low Rank Subspace Ensemble (DLRSE) method. DLRSE first employs deep matrix factorization to capture diverse and hierarchical structures in data for robust multi view multi layer data representations. Then, low rank subspace representations are learned from the extracted factors to further reveal their correlations, from which more explicit clustering structure can be obtained. We further develop a subspace ensemble learning method with structured sparsity regularization to aggregate different subspaces into a consensus subspace, which can incorporate the intrinsic clustering structure across multiple views better.

In light of this, we propose a novel marginalized multiview ensemble clustering (M2VEC) method in this paper. Specifically, we solve MVC in an EC way, which generates BPs for each view individually and seeks for a consensus one. By this means, we naturally leverage the complementary information of multiview data upon the same partition space. In order to boost the robustness of our approach, the marginalized denoising process is adopted to mimic the data corruptions and noises, which provides robust partition level representations for each view by training a single layer autoencoder. A low rank and sparse decomposition is seamlessly incorporated into the denoising process to explicitly capture the consistency information and meanwhile compensate the distinctness between heterogeneous features. Spectral consensus graph partitioning is also involved by our model to make M2VEC as a unified optimization framework. Moreover, a multilayer M2VEC is eventually delivered in a stacked fashion to encapsulate nonlinearity into partition level representations for handling complex data.

SUMMARY The last 5 years have seen a turning point in the study of the gut microbiota with a rebirth of culture dependent approaches to study the gut microbiota. High throughput methods have been developed to study bacterial diversity with culture conditions aimed at mimicking the gut environment by using rich media such as YCFA (yeast extract, casein hydrolysate, fatty acids) and Gifu anaerobic medium in an anaerobic workstation, as well as media enriched with rumen and blood and coculture, to mimic the symbiosis of the gut microbiota. Other culture conditions target phenotypic and metabolic features of bacterial species to facilitate their isolation. Preexisting technologies such as next generation sequencing and flow cytometry have also been utilized to develop innovative methods to isolate previously uncultured bacteria or explore viability in samples of interest. These techniques have been applied to isolate CPR (Candidate Phyla Radiation) among other, more classic approaches. Methanogenic archaeal and fungal cultures present different challenges than bacterial cultures. Efforts to improve the available systems to grow archaea have been successful through coculture systems. For fungi that are more easily isolated from the human microbiota, the challenge resides in the identification of the isolates, which has been approached by applying matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry technology to fungi. Bacteriotherapy represents a nonnegligible avenue in the future of medicine to correct dysbiosis and improve health or response to therapy.

This technology, however, cannot process low homology genomic regions properly, leaving the true diversity of RNA viruses unappreciated. To overcome this technological limitation we applied an advanced method, Fragmented and Primer Ligated Double stranded (ds) RNA Sequencing (FLDS) to screen RNA viruses from 155 fungal isolates, which allowed us to obtain complete viral genomes in a homology independent manner. We created a high quality catalog of 19 RNA viruses (12 viral species) that infect Aspergillus isolates. Among them, nine viruses were not detectable by the conventional methodology involving agarose gel electrophoresis of dsRNA, a hallmark of RNA virus infections. Segmented genome structures were determined in 42% of the viruses. Some RNA viruses had novel genome architectures; one contained a dual methyltransferase domain and another had a separated RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A virus from a different fungal taxon (Pyricularia) had an RdRp sequence that was separated on different segments, suggesting that a divided RdRp is widely present among fungal viruses, despite the belief that all RNA viruses encode RdRp as a single gene. These findings illustrate the previously hidden diversity and evolution of RNA viruses, and prompt reconsideration of the structural plasticity of RdRp. By highlighting the limitations of conventional surveillance methods for RNA viruses, we showcase the potential of FLDS technology to broaden current knowledge about these viruses. Author Summary The development of RNA seq technology has facilitated the discovery of RNA viruses in all types of biological samples. However, it is technically difficult to detect highly novel viruses using RNA seq. We successfully reconstructed the genomes of multiple novel fungal RNA viruses by screening host fungi using a new technology, FLDS. Surprisingly, we identified two viral species whose RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) proteins were separately encoded on different genome segments, overturning the commonly accepted view of the positional unity of RdRp proteins in viral genomes.

We describe a new peptide elicitor fraction present in several Fusarium spp. which elicits canonical PTI responses in Arabidopsis thaliana but depends on a currently unknown perception mechanism. We therefore employed a forward genetics screen using Arabidopsis plants containing a cytosolic calcium reporter (apoaequorin) to isolate fere (Fusarium Elicitor Reduced Elicitation) mutants. The fere1 mutant showed impaired PTI marker responses to an enriched elicitor fraction derived from Fusarium oxysporum but normal responses to other fungal elicitors. We mapped the causal mutation to the receptor like kinase MIK2 (MALE DISCOVERER1 INTERACTING RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE 2) with a hitherto undescribed role in PTI pathways but documented functions in other cell surface signalling pathways. The strength of the phenotype in fere1 and independent mik2 mutants supports that MIK2 is a new key component in sensing Fusarium. Fusarium elicitor responses also partially depend on PTI signalling components known for other cell surface elicitor responses such as BAK1, BIK1, PBL1, FERONIA, LLG1 and RBOHD.

It was hoped that this would improve clarity and increase understanding. Method: A systematic review identified 15 peer reviewed articles examining experiences of recovery. Twelve of these were analysed using best fit framework synthesis, with the CHIME model of recovery providing the exploratory framework. Results: The optimistic themes of CHIME accounted for the majority of people\'s experiences, but more than 30% of data were not felt to be encapsulated. An expanded conceptualisation of recovery is proposed, in which difficulties are more prominently considered.

To address this challenge, Cognitive Load Theory and Self Determination Theory provided the conceptual frameworks to the development of a Moodle based online Emergency Medicine course, inspired by real clinical cases. Methods Three consecutive classes (2013 2015) of sixth year medical students (n 304) participated in the course, during a curricular and essentially practical emergency rotation. ""Virtual Rounds"" provided weekly virtual patients in narrative format and meaningful schemata to chief complaints, in order to simulate real rounds at Emergency Unit. Additional activities such as Extreme Decisions, Emergency Quiz and Electrocardiographic challenge offered different views of emergency care. Authors assessed student\'s participation and its correlation with their academic performance. A survey evaluated students\' opinions. Students graduating in 2015 answered an online questionnaire to investigate cognitive load and motivation. Results Each student produced 1965 pageviews and spent 72 hours logged on. Although Clinical Emergency rotation has two months long, students accessed the online course during an average of 5.3 months. Virtual Rounds was the most accessed activity, and there was positive correlations between the number of hours logged on the platform and final grades on Emergency Medicine.

However, the quality of the casting is adversely affected by the change in the magnitude of the control variables. For instance, a larger magnitude of pouring velocity induces a drop effect and a lower velocity increases the likelihood of cold shut and mis run types of defects. Similarly, a high pouring temperature causes the formation of hot tears, whereas a low temperature is a source of premature solidification. Likewise, a higher moisture content yields microcracks (due to gas shrinkages) in the casting and a lower moisture content results in the poor strength of the mold. Therefore, the appropriate selection of control variables is essential to ensure quality manufactured products. The empirical relations could provide valuable guidance in this regard. Additionally, although the casting process was optimized for A356 alloy, it was mostly done for a single response.

METHODS Fifteen professional athletes and fifteen non athletes watched at a volleyball filmed sequence in which a setter receives a pass tossed from the coach and sets it forward or backward. Then, the number and duration of fixations to specific interest areas (IAs) were counted. In addition, the sequences of saccades from each IA to the others were analyzed.

The Delta variance spectra obtained from the Av maps show differences between low mass star forming (SF) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (GMC) in terms of shape of the spectrum and values of the slope beta. Low mass SF clouds have a double peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc and 4 pc. These scales may represent SF molecular clumps (1 pc) and/or the width (1 pc) and length (4 pc) of filaments. GMCs show no characteristic scale in the Av maps which can partly be ascribed to a distance effect due to a larger line of sight (LOS) confusion.

Neither the business model of passive funds, nor the way that they engage with their portfolio companies, however, is well understood, and misperceptions of both have led some commentators to call for passive investors to be subject to increased regulation and even disenfranchisement. Specifically, this literature takes a narrow view both of the market in which passive investors compete to manage customer funds and of passive investors' participation in the capital markets. We respond to this failure by providing the first comprehensive theoretical framework for passive investment and its implications for corporate governance. To start, we explain that, to understand passive funds, it is necessary to understand the institutional context in which they operate. Two key insights follow. First, because passive funds are simply a pool of assets their incentives are a product of the overall business operations of fund sponsors. Second, although passive funds are locked into their investments, their shareholders are not. Like all mutual fund investors, shareholders in index funds can exit at any time by selling their shares and receiving the net asset value of their ownership interest. Consequently, the sponsors of passive funds must compete on both price and performance with other investment options including both other passive funds and actively managed funds for investor dollars. As we explain, this competition provides passive fund sponsors with a variety of incentives to engage. Furthermore, the size of the major fund sponsors and the breadth of their holdings affords them economies of scale enabling them to engage effectively. An examination of passive investor engagement in corporate governance demonstrates that passive investors behave in accordance with this theory. Passive investors are devoting greater sophistication and resources to engagement with their portfolio companies and are exploiting their comparative advantages their size, breadth of portfolio and resulting economies of scale to focus on issues with a broad market impact, such as potential corporate governance reforms, that have the potential to reduce the underperformance and mispricing of portfolio companies. Passive investors use these tools, as opposed to analyzing firm specific operational issues, to reduce the relative advantage that active funds gain through their ability to trade. We conclude by exploring the overall implications of the rise of passive investment for corporate law and financial regulation. We argue that, although existing critiques of passive investors are unfounded, the rise of passive investing raises new concerns about ownership concentration, conflicts of interest and common ownership. We evaluate these concerns and the extent to which they warrant changes to existing regulation and practice."", 'corpus_id': 92979720, 'venue': '', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Jill E Fisch', 'Assaf Hamdani', 'Steven Davidoff Solomon'], 'n_citations': 39, 'n_key_citations': 4, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '13814793', 'title': 'Can the Market Multiply and Divide?

However, dollar price changes are ubiquitously reported and discussed. This may both cause and reflect a tendency of investors to think about the impact of news in dollar terms, leading to more extreme return responses to news for lower priced stocks. We find a number of results consistent with such non proportional thinking. First, lower priced stocks have higher total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility, and market betas, after controlling flexibly for size. To identify a causal effect of price, we show that volatility increases sharply following pre announced stock splits and drops following reverse stock splits. The returns of lower priced stocks also respond more strongly to firm specific news events, all else equal. The economic magnitudes are large: a doubling in a stock's nominal price is associated with a 20 30% decline in its volatility, beta, and return response to firm specific news. These patterns are not exclusive to small, illiquid stocks; they hold even among the largest stocks. Non proportional thinking can explain a variety of asset pricing anomalies such as long run and short run reversals, as well as the negative relation between past returns and volatility (i.e. the leverage effect) Our analysis also shows that the well documented negative relation between risk (volatility or beta) and size is actually driven by nominal prices rather than fundamentals."", 'corpus_id': 13814793, 'venue': '', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Kelly Shue', 'Richard R Townsend'], 'n_citations': 23, 'n_key_citations': 1, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '155108047', 'title': 'Predicting Financial Markets Using The Wisdom of Crowds', 'abstract': ""In the world of finance, one key lesson is the importance of psychology in the behavior of financial markets.

In medical domain, knowledge is usually represented by discrete and arbitrary rules.

There have been various works on filling the missing values in multivariate time series. Classical imputation methods include KNN based, Matrix Factorization based, and Expectation Maximization (EM) based imputation and so on. These methods are developed for general imputation purpose and rarely utilize the temporal relations between observations. Classical statistical time series models such as autoregressive (AR) models and dynamic linear models (DLM) (e.g. [1] can capture the temporal information, but they are essentially linear and may not be suitable for modern complex large scale data. ImputeTS [2] employs time dependencies on univariate time series imputation, which ignores feature correlations. Recent works [3, 4] develop the imputation framework that can take advantages of the traditional methods and resolve their drawbacks. Another trend of models is based on recurrent neural network (RNN) [5 10] utilizing RNN to capture temporal dependencies and further considering various aspects of the data characteristics, such as time decay, feature correlation, residual link, and temporal belief gate. In this paper, we propose an RNN based imputation method for filling the missing values in multivariate time series. RNN is used to capture the temporal information of time series.

In order to capture similarity information from multiple future time points simultaneously, we formulate a multi task metric learning approach to identify patient similarity.

A prototype phantom has been designed, fabricated, and evaluated. The phantom described here is powered by gravity alone, requires no external equipment for operation, and produces a stable fluid velocity useful for quality assurance. Many commercially available Doppler ultrasound testing systems can suffer from issues such as a lengthy setup, prohibitive cost, nonportable size, or difficulty in use. This new phantom design aims to address some of these problems and create a phantom appropriate for assessing Doppler ultrasound stability. METHODS The phantom was fabricated using a 3D printer. The basic design of the phantom is to provide gravity powered flow of a Doppler fluid between two reservoirs. The printed components were connected with latex tubing and then seated in a tissue mimicking gel. Spectral Doppler waveforms were sampled to evaluate variations in the data, and the phantom was evaluated using high frame rate video to find an alternate measure of mean fluid velocity flowing in the phantom. RESULTS The current system design maintains stable flow from one reservoir to the other for approximately 7 s. Color Doppler imaging of the phantom was found to be qualitatively consistent with laminar flow. Using pulsed spectral Doppler, the average fluid velocity from a sample volume approximately centered in the synthetic vessel was measured to be 56 cm/s with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm/s across 118 measurements. An independent measure of the average fluid velocity was measured to be 51.9 cm/s with a standard deviation of 0.7 cm/s over 4 measurements. CONCLUSIONS The developed phantom provides stable fluid flow useful for frequent clinical Doppler ultrasound testing and attempts to address several obstacles facing Doppler phantom testing.

Here, we propose a novel brain model which captures both intra and inter subject information within a multiplex network approach. This model localizes brain atrophy effects and summarizes them with a diagnostic score. On an independent test set, our multiplex based score segregates (i) normal controls (NC) from AD patients with a 0.86+ 0.01 accuracy and (ii) NC from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects that will convert to AD (cMCI) with an accuracy of 0.84+ 0.01. The model shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling the brain in equal volumes of 3, 000 mm3 ""patches"" without any a priori segmentation based on anatomical features. The multiplex approach shows great sensitivity in detecting anomalous changes in the brain; the robustness of the obtained results is assessed using both voxel based morphometry and FreeSurfer morphological features.

Duplication of the wild type APP gene in Down's syndrome leads to Ab deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD. Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to AD in 40% of cases, has been found to impair Ab clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of Ab42 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long term potentiation, and enhance long term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab42 and amyloid PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different Ab antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects.

Currently, there is no effective cure for AD, but its progression can be delayed with some treatments. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future treatment. Fluorodeoxyglucose positrons emission tomography (FDG PET) is a functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be powerful to help understand the anatomical and neural changes of brain related to AD. Most existing methods extract the handcrafted features from images, and then design a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. These methods highly depends on the preprocessing of brain images, including image rigid registration and segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which learns the intra slice and inter slice features for classification after decomposition of the 3D PET image into a sequence of 2D slices. The 2D CNNs are built to capture the features of image slices while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is cascaded to learn and integrate the inter slice features for image classification. No rigid registration and segmentation are required for PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline FDG PET images acquired from 339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

However, there is limited information about the effectiveness of this practice with fruit trees. The application of wood ash as a fertilizer in a kiwifruit plantation both with and without fertigation/irrigation was compared with that of a conventional fertigation program in a completely randomized field experiment on an acid soil in northwest (NW) Spain. The effects on plant nutritional status and on fruit yield, as well as environmental effects, were evaluated over a period of 2 y. The application of wood ash led to modest increases in soil pH and extractable nutrients (phosphorus, P; calcium, Ca; magnesium, Mg; potassium, K; boron, B) However, no consistent effects in foliar nutrient concentrations were found. Ash application led to an increase of up to 45% in the number of fruits produced, which was mainly attributed to the inputs of Ca and Mg. Although moderate increases in soil available manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni) after ash application were recorded, there were no changes in heavy metal concentrations in leaves or fruits. From the results of the study it can be concluded that wood ash can be used to improve the growth conditions of kiwi vines on acidic soils.

Kiwifruit soluble protein is mostly accounted for by the proteolytic enzyme actinidin and its inactive forms, a so called thaumatin like protein and an unusual protein called kiwellin, which has no known function. Actinidin is the predominant enzyme in kiwifruit and can play a role in aiding the digestive process. There is also a wide range of enzymes involved in the ripening of kiwifruit, particularly enzymes involved in polysaccharide and oligosaccharide metabolism and in the development of flavor and aroma compounds.

The program has been a tremendous success, with 588 participants losing 2,357.2 lbs. over the past 3 years. Introduction and Background The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans state that physical activity need not be strenuous to be beneficial. The guidelines recommend a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity and a minimum of 2 days per week of strength training for adults ages 1864 (U.S. Department of Health Human Services [HHS] 2008) In Idaho, 33.4% of adults participate in 20 minutes or more of physical activity three or more days per week (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention [CDC] 2009) Information obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed an estimated 2/3 (68% of American adults and approximately 23 million children are overweight or obese. The number of overweight and obese adolescents has increased from 5% in 1996 to 17% in 2004 (Sheehy Dharod, 2008) Adult men in the nation measured in at 32.2% obese, and adult women at 35.5% (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, Curtin, 2010) In Idaho, the prevalence of overweight and obese adults has increased significantly in the past decade, from 55.7% in 2000, to 61.3% in 2009 (Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, 2010) Families living in Idaho County are facing health issues currently affecting many U.S. families. In 2009, 37.3% of screened Idaho adults had been told they have high cholesterol, with 43% of those being overweight (Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, 2010) Dawkins, McMickens, Findlay, Kirstin D. Jensen Extension Educator, Idaho County Family and Consumer Sciences University of Idaho Grangeville, Idaho kdjensen@uidaho.edu and Pace (2010) found that community leaders exhibit knowledge on questions relating to obesity; however, they were less knowledgeable when addressing questions on exercise and body mass index (BMI) Investment in effective community programs that promote increased physical activity and good nutrition and improve overall health is the motivation behind developing the weight loss challenge described here. Program Description To address the lack of rural educational programs in the areas of healthy lifestyles, physical activity, and healthy nutritional choices, University of Idaho Extension, Idaho County partnered with local health providers to develop the group Our Health Our Community. Beginning in 2009, monthly meetings were held to develop a series of educational forums and events to address the rise in obesity and chronic disease rates in the community. The most successful event to address these health issues has been the ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge. The ""Biggest Loser"" title was chosen as an incentive to gain interest in the weight loss challenge, because many people are familiar with NBC\'s television program ""The Biggest Loser."" This reality show is not without controversy, as James Hill (2005) reports, ""Patients would be more successful in losing weight if they all had personal trainers and were followed around by television cameras."" This is not a recommended healthy way to lose weight and/or body fat. Hill also states, ""Losing weight requires a long term commitment to a program that requires hard work and produces weight losses of 10 15% of initial weight."" To ensure the participants of the weight loss challenge are successful at attaining a healthier weight, it is important to include education/information based on the recommended healthy weight loss guidelines set forth by HHS. The Idaho County \'Biggest Loser\' Weight Loss Challenge is designed as a community wide physical activity, and nutrition education campaign. Organization includes: Marketing newspaper articles, flyers, radio ads, banners Dates January thru March Participants (15 and older) charged a minimal fee to cover the cost of the challenge awards, can sign up as individuals and/or teams Registration packet challenge rules, schedule of educational events, food logs, weigh in sheets, fitness center passes Participants are measured and assessed in the following areas at the kick off event: Body weight Body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) by means of bioelectrical impedance Cardiorespiratory fitness (Golding, Myers, Sinning, Three Minute Step Test, 1989) April 2013 Organizing a Community ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge JOE 51(2) (c)2013 Extension Journal Inc. 2 Muscular endurance and strength (Canadian Standardized Test of Fitness, One Minute Timed Bent Knee Sit Ups and Push Ups, 1987) Body dimensions (upper arm, chest, waist, hips, thigh, and calves) The ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge is designed on a point system. Participants receive points for the following: Attending healthy lifestyle educational events: Metabolism Me provides healthy nutrition/physical activity guidelines; Blood Sugar and Cholesterol Screening/Information; Fitness for Free working out at home, inexpensive fitness equipment, local walking/running clubs Attending the kick off /final weigh in/fitness assessment Completing the food log diary (paper logs/online food logs www.choosemyplate.gov/SuperTracker, www.myfitnesspal.com) Using fitness passes Participating in community fun run/walks To provide motivation during the challenge: Weekly email updates are sent on how the challenge is progressing. Phone calls are made to answer questions. Updates/announcements are shared on the challenge Facebook Page. Participants can weigh in at the fitness center to record weight loss. Final weigh in: Participants receive points for every pound and percent of body fat lost. A future recommendation would be to award up to two points for two pounds lost/week to reflect a healthy weight loss amount (HHS) Monetary awards are provided to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place female/male individual winners, and to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winning teams The goal is to provide a competitive and educational healthy lifestyle program to improve overall health. Evaluation Starting with the 2011 challenge, participants were given a retrospective pre post survey during the April 2013 Organizing a Community ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge JOE 51(2) (c)2013 Extension Journal Inc. 3 educational presentation on metabolism, nutrition, and physical activity. Three months following the challenge, a survey was mailed to all participants. The intention of the survey was to measure which healthy lifestyle actions and behaviors the participants were continuing with following the completion of the challenge. Total weight loss was a combined measure of the participants who completed and returned the survey. Surveys were mailed to 80 participants, with (17) completed and returned, for a 21% response rate (Table 1) Table 1. ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge, 3 Month Follow Up Survey Results, 2011 1. Eat snacks/meals frequently (5 6 times/day) 41% 2. Eat smaller portions 88% 3. Follow USDA Food Pyramid guidelines 71% 4. Participate in strength training exercises 3+ days/week 53% 5. Participate in 150+ minutes of cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise weekly 47% 6. Total Weight Loss 197.4 lbs. Conclusion Based on the 2011 program evaluation results, healthy lifestyle knowledge and behavior change was evident. Three months following the challenge finale, over 50% of the participants were continuing to eat smaller portions, follow the USDA Food Pyramid guidelines, and participate in strength training exercise 3+ days/week. Since 2009, 47 men and 541 women have participated in the ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge, 32% completing the full program. The total combined weight loss of 588 participants is 2,357.2 lbs. with an average body fat percentage loss of 2.8% Future success will depend on continued involvement by the community partners to expand the challenge to surrounding communities, provide updated education on healthy lifestyle behaviors, encourage further online participation, and to help participants bring the ""Biggest Loser"" Weight Loss Challenge back to their communities and workplaces.

Tribe Micraireae, which is C3 and sister to Eriachneae and Isachneae, occupies habitats more similar to C4 Eriachneae than C3 Isachneae. Evolutionary analyses within the subfamily are hindered by the lack of a phylogenetic framework for any substantial sample of species. Additionally, only a handful of members of Micrairoideae have been tested for photosynthetic pathway. This study presents the first well resolved phylogeny of Eriachneae based on full plastome sequences from almost half of the species in the tribe. Photosynthetic pathway is tested for 47 species representing all three tribes of Micrairoideae using carbon isotopes to test the assumption that C4 is restricted to Eriachneae. Habitat preferences among the tribes are estimated using bioclimatic data, with multivariate analyses showing that habitats of Micraireae and Eriachneae are more similar to each other than either is to Isachneae, and the range of environments is greater in Isachneae than in Eriachneae. All measured Eriachneae are confirmed to be C4, and all Isachneae are C3.

This method gives robust results for taxa of uncertain phylogenetic placement. Arundinoideae comprise ~45 species, although historically was much larger. Arundinoideae is notable for the widely invasive Phragmites australis. Micrairoideae comprise nine genera and ~200 species. Some are threatened with extinction, including Hubbardia, some Isachne spp. and Limnopoa. Two micrairoid genera, Eriachne and Pheidochloa, exhibit C4 photosynthesis in this otherwise C3 subfamily and represent an independent origin of the C4 pathway among grasses. METHODS Five new plastomes were sequenced with next generation sequencing by synthesis methods. Plastomes were assembled by de novo methods and phylogenetically analyzed with eight other recently published arundinoid or micrairoid plastomes and 11 outgroup species. Stable carbon isotope ratios were determined for micrairoid and arundinoid species to investigate ambiguities in the proxy evidence for C4 photosynthesis. KEY RESULTS Phylogenomic analyses showed strong support for ingroup nodes in the Arundinoideae/Micrairoideae subtree, including a paraphyletic clade of Hubbardieae with Isachneae. Anatomical, biochemical, and positively selected sites data are ambiguous with regard to the photosynthetic pathways in Micrairoideae. Species of Hubbardia, Isachne, and Limnopoa were definitively shown by d13C measurements to be C3 and Eriachne to be C4.

In this context, one popular trend is for urban planar structures recognition (floor/ground recognition) because they have consistent appearance under urban scenarios and they can be used to improve several computer vision applications performance, for example, in autonomous vehicle navigation, robotic control, 3D modeling, etc. In the current literature, there are several approaches for floor recognition. However, most previous work has low robustness under image degradations (blur, lighting changes, noise, etc. One alternative to address the image degradation problems is the use of binary features (for example LBP features) In this work, we propose a new binary patterns based floor recognition suitable for urban scenes.

However, a practical floor localization system should consider the absence of infrastructure, the pretrained database and the influence of complex environment. Inertial sensors based systems realize floor localization by classifying pedestrian's motion states, which can avoid the above problems. Nevertheless, the accuracy is limited because of the stochastic noise introduced by device measurement. Besides, only single acceleration feature is utilized in most of the existing systems. Fusion of multiple inertial sensors and other signals such as frequency modulated (FM) radio signals is a feasible solution considering both practicality and accuracy. In this paper, a multi feature floor localization algorithm using MEMS inertial sensors and a FM radio receiver is designed. Firstly, based on the MEMS inertial sensors and FM radio signals, we select features which are not affected by types or sites of stairs for the classification of plane walking, going upstairs, and going downstairs moments. Secondly, random forest classifiers are introduced to obtain accurate classification results by combining the above features. Floor is located on the basis of classification results. Field experiments have been conducted at four sites in two office buildings to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

In addition, we adjusted for the influence of gender, age group, maturity status and state basketball federation on the outcomes. Methods: The sample included 120 female and 201 male adolescent basketball players aged 14.0 (1.7) years, on average. We grouped players by the age of onset of deliberate basketball practice as related to biologic maturation milestones (pre puberty deliberate practice onset, mid puberty deliberate practice onset and late puberty deliberate practice onset) Results: There was no substantial variation among contrasting players by the onset of deliberate practice in all of the outcomes. Adjusting for gender, male players with late puberty deliberate practice onset had better functional performance than players with pre and mid puberty onset of practice. Females players with late puberty deliberate practice onset had slightly worst functional performance than players with pre and mid puberty onset of practice. Conclusions: Early deliberate basketball practice does not appear to provide an advantage for the development of physiological functions.

Lending rates are composed of different factors: the base rate is the price that the customer is willing to pay. The risk premium is given to compensate the lenders risk of full or partial failure of repayment. The inflation adjustment takes into account the impairment of money over the term of a loan. The liquidity premium increases with extension of the term of the loan. The European Central Bank influences the interest rate policy by varying the interest for money saved there by the banks. At the moment there are used negative interest rates, i.e. penalty interest. The methodology used was that recently the ECB lowered the interest rates which might cause real estate bubbles and, subsequently, banks and economic crises may follow, if interest rates were to be increased again sooner or later. Therefor the author studied the amount of sales and the connection to the interest rates and the interest rate policy of the banks right now.

American consumers default on more than $200 billion in non mortgage debt each year, and more than 14 percent of consumers have at least one debt in collections (Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2014) There are significant deadweight losses for both borrowers and lenders of loan default and collection, particularly when debt contracts are incomplete (e.g. Bolton and Rosenthal 2002).1 Lenders must either pay to collect the debt directly or sell the debt to a thirdparty debt collector for a fraction of the face value. In turn, borrowers have an incentive to avoid these collection efforts through potentially costly strategies, such as leaving the formal banking system to avoid asset seizures or leaving the formal labor market to avoid wage garnishment. In these kinds of scenarios, ex post loan modifications can theoretically benefit both borrowers and lenders by completing debt contracts and preventing loan default. To date, however, there is little empirical evidence on whether loan modifications provide any benefits, and if so, what types of loan modifications are most effective increasing repayment and decreasing financial distress. This paper uses a randomized experiment and administrative tax and bankruptcy records to estimate the impact of different loan modifications on repayment, bankruptcy, and labor supply. The experiment was designed and implemented by the largest non profit credit counseling organization in the United States. Eleven large unsecured creditors agreed to offer lower interest rates and lower minimum monthly payments to approximately 40,000 distressed borrowers that contacted the nonprofit organization between January 2005 and August 2006. For a typical borrower in our sample, the median interest rate reduction of 3.69 percentage points shortened the repayment period by about four months and decreased the total amount repaid by $1,712. The median monthly payment reduction of 0.14 percent of initial debt holdings, or about $26.68, lengthened the repayment period by four months and increased the total amount repaid by $289. We identify the effects of lower interest rates and longer repayment periods using two unique features of the randomized experiment. First, each of the eleven creditors participating in the experiment offered a different bundle of interest rate and monthly payment reductions, and second, borrowers in our sample owed different amounts to each of these creditors. As a result of these features, otherwise similar borrowers received very different interest rate and monthly payment reLoan default may also generate negative externalities through price effects (e.g. Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak 2011, Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi forthcoming) or the distortion of household consumption and investment decisions (e.g. Guerrieri and Lorenzoni 2011, Hall 2011, Midrigan and Philippon 2011, Eggertson and Krugman 2012, Farhi and Werning 2013, Mian, Rao, and Sufi 2013, Mian and Sufi 2014)', 'corpus_id': 210959507, 'venue': '', 'year': 2015.0, 'author_names': ['Will Dobbie', 'Jae Song'], 'n_citations': 8, 'n_key_citations': 1, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '54590415', 'title': 'Statistical Analysis on the Loan Repayment Efficiency and Its Impact on the Borrowers: a Case Study of Hawassa City, Ethiopia', 'abstract': 'The major objective of this study is to study factors affecting loan repayment efficiency of borrowers and assess impact of efficient utilization of loan for the borrowers in Hawassa city in Ethiopia. Data used for this study was collected through a structured questionnaire. Classical and Bayesian logistic regression technique were used for data analysis.

Results of the classical binary logistic regression indicate that better repayment efficiency is associated with borrowers: sex, educational status, number of dependent family member, monthly income, loan size, additional source of income, motivation of repayment, time given for repayment, interest rate and screening mechanism when individuals apply for the loan.

The majority of its population still lives in rural areas and is dependent on agriculture for sustenance. A significant proportion of this population lives under poverty, which is a complex phenomenon and manifests itself in a myriad ways.

Dalit entrepreneurs steady to working and their positive motive for the business.EntrepreneurshipEntrepreneurship is the attempt to creative value through recognition of business opportunity, the management of risk taking appropriate to the opportunity, and through the communicative and management skills to mobilize human, financial, and material resources necessary to bring a project to fruition. Entrepreneurship is a creative activity. An entrepreneur is basically an innovator who introduces something new into the economy. The innovation may be a method of production not yet applied in the particular branch of manufacturing, or a product with which consumers are not yet familiar or a new source of raw material or a new market hitherto unexploited or a new combination of means of production. An entrepreneur foresees the potentially profitable opportunity and tries to exploit it. Innovation involves problem solving and the entrepreneur is a problem solver.Dalit EntrepreneursThe fund was envisaged as a way to finance the expansion and modernization of dalit run businesses and also fund prospective dalit entrepreneurs. What grabbed the dalit entrepreneur's attention was a new principle. Under existing schemes for scheduled castes, the state has been the giver and the community the recipient. Now, dalit entrepreneurs need not worry about collateral and make rounds of banks, as we have our own venture fund.Socio economic condition of Dalit entrepreneursThe Scheduled castes entrepreneurs have been victims of socio economic exploitation and have been relegated to low income generating occupations, inferior trades, unhygienic environment and unclean menial occupations. Although overt untouchability practices may be declining in many parts of the country, caste rigidities continue to confine many scheduled caste worker in demeaning occupations, which put them at a disadvantage when compared to other communities. The forces of urbanization, social and protective legislations, positive discrimination and other measures taken by the Government, have led to gradual improvement in occupational mobility and living standards over the years, but the living conditions of the majority of scheduled castes continue to show socio economic backwardness.Status of Dalit EntrepreneursThe majority of dalit entrepreneurs is poor, socially backward, and deprived of basic needs. Though some dalits have occupied important positions in politics and government jobs, majority of them have faced discrimination like access to education, health and honorable livelihood. The dalit entrepreneur generally perform menial and degrade jobs, Social backwardness, and lack of access to education.

This article is focused on the Economic violence against dalit entrepreneurs in Tamilnadu. Introduction Dalits are known and considered as the 'untouchables' to the world. The identity of 'untouchable' emerged from the practice and belief even today that touching people from castes identified as the lowest can bring about defilement from the impurity that people from such castes carry from birth till death. Economic violence frequently describes best the nature of interactions between the dalits and the non dalits in India. Dalits are constantly subjected to egregious violence, dehumanizing labour, and a pervasive system of social exclusion. With regard to the economic violation against dalit entrepreneurs, State and inter Governmental actions on human rights have failed to achieve anything more than modest success, the development of effective measures for the prevention and remedying of economic violations against dalit entrepreneurs, social and cultural rights must surely classify as one of the most glaring. This state of affairs has little, however, to do with the nature of the obligations and rights established in the covenant jurisprudence, which have kept economic, social and cultural rights wallowing in the relative purgatory of global efforts to secure human rights. the economic violation against dalit entrepreneurs in Tamilnadu starting from the reason for economic violation against dalit entrepreneurs, ways of violation, opinion on discrimination in business, dominated by upper caste entrepreneurs, competing with upper caste entrepreneurs, obstacles for business, and repayment of bank loan by dalit entrepreneurs, training programmes and infrastructure facility. Statement of the Problem Violence is the expression of physical force against others, compelling action against one's will on pain of death or physical harm. Variant uses of the term refer to the destruction of nonliving objects. Worldwide, violence is used as a tool of manipulation and also is an area of concern for law and culture what take attempts to suppress and stop it. Violence can take many forms anywhere from mere hitting between two humans where there can be bodily harm, to war and genocide where millions may die as a result. It should be noted that violence can be non physical as well. Dalit entrepreneurs have lived in deep social and economic isolation. They were socially and economically disintegrated from the mainstream of societal living and the working of its concomitant viz. economy. Accordingly, a large number of these households have very poor socio economic receptivity for modern change and development. in this regards this study will be focus on the Economic violation against the dalit entrepreneurs in initial stage ,fiance and marketing problems. Objective of the Study To identify the economic violence against dalit entrepreneurs in Tamilnadu. Methodology The present research study is descriptive in nature using both primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected with the help of structured interview scheduled. Secondary data were collected from the published and unpublished sources. Stratified random sampling method was used as the sampling technique.

However, it is also non convex which renders any optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non convexity introduced by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time optimized dynamically consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several multi contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are consistent with the original non convex problem and illustrate how timing optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with fixed timing +Implementation details and demos can be found in the source code available at https:/git amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/bponton/timeoptimization.', 'corpus_id': 3544597, 'venue': '2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)', 'year': 2018.0, 'author_names': ['Brahayam Ponton', 'Alexander Herzog', 'Stefan Schaal', 'Ludovic Righetti'], 'n_citations': 31, 'n_key_citations': 4, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '3369782', 'title': 'A cable based series elastic actuator with conduit sensor for wearable exoskeletons', 'abstract': 'There is currently a scarcity of wearable robotic devices that can practically provide physical assistance in a range of real world activities.

However, there has been no consensus on the relationship between economic growth and financial development. Therefore this paper sought to determine the linkage between financial factors and financial development in 19 COMESA Countries. The specific objectives were to establish the effect of international remittances, financial access, inflation and foreign direct investment on financial development in COMESA Countries. The paper was guided by the financegrowth nexus theory. Data was collected from the IMF and World Bank database for analysis for the period. Fixed effect regression was used as established by use of the General Method of Moments. The results indicated that financial access, foreign direct investment and GDP had a significant effect on financial development in COMESA countries (p values 0.05) Therefore, results are expected to provide a basis for policy reference and also stimulate debate on financial development in developing countries under regional integration. The study is expected to generate new knowledge by indicating the relationship between financial factors, economic growth, and financial development. In particular, each COMESA Country should streamline policies aimed at encouraging FDI inflows, increasing economic growth, as well as designing Diaspora policies to encourage foreign remittances and foster financial development. I. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY inancial development has attracted a lot of debate among researchers and scholars. Extant literature available has defined financial development as the improvements in the quantity, quality, and efficiency of financial intermediary services (Akinbuade and Kinfick, 2014; Abu Bada and AbuQarn 2006) In most developing countries, including SSA, the financial services sector is underdeveloped to play its role of intermediation and thus quest to bridge the gap between demand and supply of credit (Wolf, 2003) The financial services sector act as an intermediary between borrowers and savers in emerging economies of the world. The Government needs the financial sector to supplement any budget deficits that arise in any financial year (Adams et al. 2018) Despite the importance of financial sector development, Sub Saharan Africa is relatively less underdeveloped and diversified as compared to other regions of the World. The insurance industry in Africa is at its infant stage and relatively underdeveloped as compared to other emerging economies as indicated by Otchere (2011) The result from this study indicates that the insurance market in some African Countries has focused on non life insurance which represents about 85% of the industry. The proxy to insurance companies is the number of insurance firms in the industry. Further, Otchere (2011) argue that Stock markets which form part of the financial sector in Sub Saharan Africa are very few and small in size as compared to those in the developed World. The proxy to stock markets is the number of listed companies and market capitalization. The stock exchange trading systems in Africa are inefficient since they use manual trading and clearing system. The manual system of trading in Africa is an impediment to operational efficiencies as well as liquidity. However, a few African Countries have adopted automated systems such as Johannesburg securities exchange in South Africa, Nigerian Stock Exchange in Nigeria; Namibian stock exchange in Namibia, Stock exchange Mauritius and Nairobi Stock Exchange in Kenya.Bond markets in Africa according to Otchere (2011) are not well developed or at best at its infancy stage or are absent altogether in many African Countries. Most Countries do not have secondary bond market apart from Nigeria. Further, most Countries do not have a wide range of treasury bills and bonds except South Africa which has a developed Government bond market. The banking sector indicates that African financials are characterized by the small banking system and that banks are poor in channeling deposits to the most efficient uses, signaling low intermediation efficiency (Lavine, (1997) Similarly, Adams et al. (2018) share the same view that the financial services sector is underdeveloped to play its role of intermediation. More so, African banks have low outreach with banks enjoying high interest rate spread and targeting short term finance at the expense of long term finance for investment. Sandrine, (2010) argue that the intermediation ratio of SSA banks is small than in other developing countries indicating that in Africa, the bank has difficulty in ensuring that collected deposits are given as loans to the private sector for investment. Further, the study shows that banks in SSA offer loans to clients with good capacity for repayment especially big foreign companies or domestic public ones while local small and medium enterprises are often not taken into consideration. Menyah and Allen (2011) indicate that F International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science (IJRISS) |Volume III, Issue X, October 2019|ISSN 2454 6186 www.rsisinternational.org Page 186 financial systems in SSA are not well developed despite its importance in supporting sustainable and balanced growth. Such a developed financial sector enhances the availability of funding by mobilizing idle savings, facilitates the transaction and attracting foreign investment. The extant literature available indicates SSA has variations in financial development. II.

COMESA is the region economic integration where Tanzania joined in 1994 with the expectation of gaining more benefits through trade relations that existed between the member states. The article explains how the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa failed to meet the required targets to some of its member states particularly Tanzania and leading to withdraw its membership. The expectations of Tanzania to promote trade relations and improving exportations alongside with developing domestic industries and small and medium enterprises seemed to fail. The economic gap between Tanzania and other member states was increasing day to day to the extent in 1990's Tanzania was among of the poorest countries in the world. The efforts were taken to revive the economy, and one of the approaches taken was to withdraw from one of the regional economic integration that was COMESA. The findings show that zero tariff reduction agreement was the major influence of Tanzania to withdraw its membership from COMESA. Reducing tariffs to 100% was a threat for Tanzania because according to trade policy review of 2000 shows that Tanzania was heavily relying on revenues from trade tariffs and VAT. Therefore, if Tanzania would remain in COMESA and implementing zero tariff reduction could more affect its revenue collection. According to East African trade review, implementation of the new tariff regime would cost the government a total of US$80 million annually and also would affect the domestic industries due to unable to sustain the competitiveness of the market for imported goods from other member countries.According to Hon. Benjamin Mkapa (1999) the former President of the United Republic of Tanzanian President, the large part of Tanzania revenue was depending on tariffs charges from foreign goods particularly from neighboring land locked countries such as DRC, Zambia, Malawi, Burundi and Rwanda that have been using Tanzania as transit to import and export their goods through Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Tanga ports and transporting to their countries. The products were usually imposed trade tariffs through customs border agents and forming necessary source of revenue to Tanzania. According to him, if Tanzania would agree to remove all trade barriers to zero tariffs would harm its revenue collection and leading economic instability.

Due to the country specific scenario of high social and demographic heterogeneity, combined with limited testing capacity, lack of reliable data, under reporting of cases, and restricted testing policy, the focus of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a generalized SEIRD model that implicitly takes into account the quarantine measures, and (ii) to estimate the response of the COVID 19 spread dynamics to perturbations/uncertainties. By investigating the projections of cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases, as well as the effective reproduction number, we show that the model parameter related to social distancing measures is one of the most influential along all stages of the disease spread and the most influential after the infection peak.

The results highlight the need of keeping social distancing policies to control the disease spread. Specifically, the considered scenario of abrupt social distancing relaxation implemented after the occurrence of the peak of positively diagnosed cases can prolong the epidemic, with a significant increase of the projected numbers of confirmed and death cases.

Stratification by mothers\' education reveals that although all children, regardless of mother\'s education, benefit from spending educational and structured time with their mothers, mothers who are high school graduates have the greatest difficulty balancing work and childcare. We find some evidence that fathers compensate for maternal employment by increasing types of activities that can foster child development as well as types of activities that may be detrimental.

However, running computationally demanding applications at the UEs is constrained by limited battery capacity and energy consumption of the UEs. A suitable solution extending the battery life time of the UEs is to offload the applications demanding huge processing to a conventional centralized cloud. Nevertheless, this option introduces significant execution delay consisting of delivery of the offloaded applications to the cloud and back plus time of the computation at the cloud. Such a delay is inconvenient and makes the offloading unsuitable for real time applications. To cope with the delay problem, a new emerging concept, known as mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced. The MEC brings computation and storage resources to the edge of mobile network enabling it to run the highly demanding applications at the UE while meeting strict delay requirements. The MEC computing resources can be exploited also by operators and third parties for specific purposes. In this paper, we first describe major use cases and reference scenarios where the MEC is applicable. After that we survey existing concepts integrating MEC functionalities to the mobile networks and discuss current advancement in standardization of the MEC. The core of this survey is, then, focused on user oriented use case in the MEC, i.e. computation offloading.

Italy has now become the most hit country outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for SARS CoV 2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non diagnosed is important because non diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment.

Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. In our view, COVID 19 has developed into a pandemic, with small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan. Most countries are likely to have spread of COVID 19, at least in the early stages, before any mitigation measures have an impact. What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic. This impact of the COVID 19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID 19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002 03, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID 19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals. The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID 19. The basic reproduction number (R0) which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1 1/R0. With R0 values for COVID 19 in China around 2*5 in the early stages of the epidemic, we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures. The speed of the initial spread of the epidemic, its doubling time, or the related serial interval (the mean time it takes for an infected person to pass on the infection to others) and the likely duration of the epidemic are determined by factors such as the length of time from infection to when a person is infectious to others and the mean duration of infectiousness. For the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, in most infected people these epidemiological quantities were short with a day or so to infectiousness and a few days of peak infectiousness to others. By contrast, for COVID 19, the serial interval is estimated at 4*4 7*5 days, which is more similar to SARS. First among the important unknowns about COVID 19 is the case fatality rate (CFR) which requires information on the denominator that defines the number infected. We are unaware of any completed large scale serology surveys to detect specific antibodies to COVID 19. Best estimates suggest a CFR for COVID 19 of about 0*3 1% which is higher than the order of 0*1% CFR for a moderate influenza A season. The second unknown is the whether infectiousness starts before onset of symptoms. The incubation period for COVID 19 is about 5 6 days. Combining this time with a similar length serial interval suggests there might be considerable presymptomatic infectiousness (appendix 1) For reference, influenza A has a presymptomatic infectiousness of about 1 2 days, whereas SARS had little or no presymptomatic infectiousness. There have been few clinical studies to measure COVID 19 viraemia and how it changes over time in individuals. In one study of 17 patients with COVID 19, peak viraemia seems to be at the end of the incubation period, pointing to the possibility that viraemia might be high enough to trigger transmission for 1 2 days before onset of Published Online March 6, 2020 https:/doi.org/10.1016/ S0140 6736(20)30567 5', 'corpus_id': 212631735, 'venue': 'The Lancet', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Roy M Anderson', 'Hans Heesterbeek', 'Don Klinkenberg', 'T Deirdre Hollingsworth'], 'n_citations': 1993, 'n_key_citations': 55, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '213004806', 'title': 'A Note on the Evolution of Covid 19 in Italy', 'abstract': 'We employ methods largely exploited in Physics, in the analysis of the evolution of dynamical systems, to study the pattern of the Covid 19 infection in Italy.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID 19] which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID 19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID 19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID 19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days) and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID 19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS CoV 2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

PURPOSE Here, we demonstrate that wogonoside protects against intestinal barrier dysfunction in colitis via the MLCK/pMLC2 pathway both in vivo and in vitro. METHODS Caco 2 cell monolayers treated with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF a showed barrier dysfunction and were assessed in the absence and presence of wogonoside for various physiological, morphological, and biochemical parameters. Colitis was induced by 3% DSS in mice, which were used as an animal model to explore the pharmacodynamics of wogonoside. We detected MLCK/pMLC2 pathway proteins via western blot analysis, assessed the cytokines IL 13 and IFN g via ELISA, tested bacterial translocation via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a proper sampling of secondary lymphoid organs for bacterial culture. In addition, the docking affinity of wogonoside and MLCK was observed with DS2.5 software. RESULTS Wogonoside alleviated the disruption of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in TNF a exposured Caco 2 cell; FITC dextran hyperpermeability; loss of the tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin, ZO 1 and claudin 1 in Caco 2 cell monolayers; and bacterial translocation in colitic mice. Moreover, wogonoside reduced the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL 13 and IFN g to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that wogonoside ameliorated the destruction of intestinal epithelial TJs. Wogonoside not only inhibited the cytoskeletal F actin rearrangement induced by TNF a, stabilized the cytoskeletal structure, suppressed MLCK protein expression, and reduced MLC2 phosphorylation. In addition, the results of molecular docking analysis showed that wogonoside had a high affinity for MLCK and formed hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residue LYS261 and p bonds with LYS229. CONCLUSION Collectively, our study indicates that wogonoside alleviates colitis by protecting against intestinal barrier dysfunction, and the potential mechanism may involve regulation of TJs via the MLCK/pMLC2 signaling pathway.

METHODS TRAIL and TRAIL receptor expression were analyzed in normal, inflammatory ileum/colon and human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines (HIEC) Caco 2, and HT 29 using RNase protection assay, real time and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. TRAIL induced activation of NF kappaB was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)15 expression and interleukin (IL)8 production were studied by RT PCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Apoptosis was monitored using Annexin V/caspase 3 assays. RESULTS Normal mature IEC expressed low TRAIL levels, whereas, in inflammatory lesions, TRAIL messenger RNA and protein were markedly up regulated in IEC and lamina propria lymphocytes at levels comparable with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced colitis. Interferon gamma and TNF alpha potently induced TRAIL in IEC. In vitro analyses revealed a dual biologic effect of TRAIL on HIEC: Under noninflammatory conditions, TRAIL up regulated via nuclear factor kappaB CARD15 and IL 8, whereas, under inflammatory conditions, TRAIL became a potent inducer of apoptosis in HIEC, which was confirmed ex vivo using ileal organ cultures. TNF alpha markedly increased the expression of the proapoptotic receptor TRAIL R2. TRAIL induced IEC apoptosis required a functional caspase cascade. CONCLUSIONS TRAIL is a new inflammatory mediator implicated in the homeostasis of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. TRAIL is highly up regulated in IEC in inflammatory ileum and colon.

Although characteristic patterns are evident in visual inspection, using qEEG techniques has the potential to provide quantitative evidence of treatment efficacy. We first assessed spectral power from baseline EEG recordings collected from children with AS compared to age matched neurotypical controls, which corroborated the previously reported finding of increased total power driven by elevated delta power in children with AS. We then retrospectively analyzed data collected during a clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of minocycline (3 mg/kg/d) to compare pretreatment recordings from children with AS (4 12 years of age) to EEG activity at the end of treatment and following washout for EEG spectral power and epileptiform events. At baseline and during minocycline treatment, the AS subjects demonstrated increased delta power; however, following washout from minocycline treatment the AS subjects had significantly reduced EEG spectral power and epileptiform activity. Our findings support the use of qEEG analysis in evaluating AS and suggest that this technique may be useful to evaluate therapeutic efficacy in AS.

We find that the threat of a robot substitution does not affect the amount of effort exerted by workers. Also, neither universal basic income nor a tax on robots decrease workers' effort.

If the entire package of UBI and funding sources were in effect, society (and American capitalism) would be on a more stable, equitable, and environmentally sustainable footing.', 'corpus_id': 229463367, 'venue': '', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Drew Riedl'], 'n_citations': 1, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}]"

All parts of the UK will be differently affected by the decision to leave the European Union (EU) (i.e. Brexit) after 29 March 2019, particularly by the creation of an independent trade policy. As a member of the EU customs union and of the single market, the UK does not at present have an independent trade policy. Instead, trade policy is ""largely determined by the EU""2, a position that will change upon the UK\'s departure from the EU. While trade is a reserved matter, areas of devolved competence such as agriculture will need to be taken account of in any future UK trade policy. The devolved administrations will require to be involved in what Dr Fox identified as ""a once in a lifetime opportunity to build a stronger, fairer and more prosperous United Kingdom that is more open and outward looking than ever before.""3 Indeed, the Policy Paper mentioned above further recognised that, ""(t)he devolved administrations will have a direct interest in our future trade agreements,""4 with this recognition accompanied by a commitment, ""to seek the input of the devolved administrations to ensure they influence the UK\'s future trade policy, recognising the role they will have in developing and delivering it.""5 In this present paper, we critically review the UK government\'s current approach to involving the devolved administrations in post Brexit trade policy development. We demonstrate that there is a significant lack of clarity on the future role of the devolved administrations in the development of trade policy. The Scottish government is particularly concerned in this respect given that its extensive devolution settlement includes areas with significant trade dimensions such as agriculture, fisheries and environmental policy. We argue that greater clarity on such involvement is very much needed and in response, propose the creation of a Trade Policy Committee through an amendment to the Trade Bill.', 'corpus_id': 150437065, 'venue': 'Edinburgh Law Review', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Stephanie Switzer', 'Joseph A McMahon'], 'n_citations': 0, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '211785959', 'title': 'Understanding the Influence and Effects of Devolution on Agricultural Development: A Case Study of Garissa County, Kenya', 'abstract': 'The Agriculture sector in Kenya is as important as the country. Much of the agricultural function was transferred to the devolved units when the new constitution was passed by Kenyans and promulgated. The question many are asking is, have county governments initiated strategies in place to improve food security and ultimately contribute to the economy. Agriculture is the major contributor of our economy today. Kenya needs to be a self sufficient country and feed its people. County governments have a huge role in ensuring this objective achieved. Based on this, a research title is proposed ""Understanding the influence and effects of devolution on agricultural development: A case study of Garissa county, Kenya"" The research seeks to clarify to the public and the other stakeholders concerned if actually devolved units have done anything to improve the agricultural sector since its inception.

The research findings will be very helpful to those who are involve in the agricultural sector, directly or indirectly. The research objectives are; to compare performance of agriculture before and after devolution, to evaluate the achievements of devolution in the agricultural sector, to analyse the challenges faced by county governments in developing this sector, to examine the perception of the public on the best strategies to improve agriculture in Kenya and to give synthesised recommendations to all stakeholders. The research was conducted within Garissa County, four out of the six sub counties.

At a glance, devolution has come with both benefits and downsides, which are unique to the service/function that has been devolved. Agriculture was previously a function of the National government, under the Ministry of Agriculture. It is currently a devolved ministry, no longer under the sole control of the National government. Same as other devolved functions, it was expected that devolving the ministry of Agriculture would lead to better agricultural production at county level. Devolution Agricultural functions was expected to enhance agricultural production in the counties. The study thus sought to establish the effect of devolution of the agricultural sector on the livelihoods in Wajir County. This study was guided by the following objectives; to establish the effects of devolution of agricultural sector on the empowerment of small scale farmers, to determine the effects of devolution of agricultural sector on incomes of households and to examine the effects of devolution of agricultural sector on food security of households in Wajir County. The study is hinged on the Sustainable Livelihood Approach. The study adopted a descriptive survey that helped in determining and reports the way things are and attempts to describe such things as possible behavior, attitudes, values, and characteristics. The study targeted5273 small scale farmers and agricultural officers across all Wajir sub counties. The study sampled 372 farmers from all the Sub Counties in Wajir. Therefore, 372 farmers and 6 agricultural officers were used making a total sample size of 378 respondents. The researcher purposively selected six agricultural officers one from each sub county. In identifying the farmers from each sub county, the study used simple random sampling. The study will adopt both qualitative and quantitative data. The study used questionnaires for collecting data from 372 farmers, which will be constructed based on the research objectives. The questionnaires were administered using drop and pick method; this provided farmers with enough time to answer the questions. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics such as mean, mode, percentages and standard deviation. The study used Chi Square to establish the relationship between the variables. The study findings indicated that the effect of devolution of agricultural activities in Wajir County has significantly affected the level of food security, sources of income and empowerment among the households in the county. Due to devolution of the agricultural activities, the county government now provides extension services, funds, inputs such as fertilizers and credits for agricultural activities and that has led to an increase in food production which has greatly improved food security and enhanced income generation. The small scale farmers no longer rely on livestock farming but also crop farming. Since the study findings present a significant effect of devolution of the agricultural activities to the county level in Wajir, it recommends that the county government should invest more in some of the agricultural activities such as access to agricultural services like Plough and tractor, Borehole and dam for irrigation, Extension services, Livestock vaccination and Disease surveillance, control, and awareness. There should also be an increase in the provision of services such as the provision of farm inputs and marketing of farm products on behalf of farmers in order to encourage more participation in agriculture by the households. In so doing, the small scale farmers in Wajir County will be more empowered, their income will improve and food security will also be enhanced.', 'corpus_id': 199323753, 'venue': 'International Journal of Current Aspects', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Ibrahim Jimale Muhumed', 'David Mwaniki Minja'], 'n_citations': 0, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '169866289', 'title': 'The devolution revolution: Implications for agricultural service delivery in Ghana:', 'abstract': ""In 2009, Ghana began pursuing the devolution of functions and responsibilities from the central government to the country's 216 Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) Agriculture was among one of the first sectors to be devolved, a process that became effective in 2012. This paper analyzes how this transition has proceeded, with a focus on the implications for agricultural civil servants within the MMDAs, accountability to citizens, and agricultural expenditures. Empirically, the paper draws on a survey of 960 rural households, 80 District Directors of Agriculture (DDAs) district level budget data from 2012 to 2016, and semi structured interviews with a range of national and local government stakeholders. The findings show a number of positive benefits of the transition for DDAs, including more opportunities for employment mobility and the chance to engage more with local citizens in designing agricultural projects. Yet, financial constraints are the main complaint, with low and uncertain funding a common hindrance to delivering services and adequately staffing offices. Budget data reveals that the share of funding budgeted for agriculture has changed only marginally since 2012 while agricultural expenditures in absolute terms and as a proportion of agricultural households has declined, even in comparison to other devolved sectors. Political incentives may be partially responsible for these trends in budgeting as elected Assembly members tend to prioritize other sectors with more visible outcomes.

Modern rail safety regulation aims to promote continuous improvement in the management of rail safety. Achieving this outcome relies on good regulatory decision making driven by legislation and policies based on prevailing societal values. These decisions should be guided by regulatory good practice, supported by findings from safety science research. The just culture approach seeks to balance the need to hold people accountable for their actions while facilitating opportunities to learn from accidents. The just culture concept has been applied in industries such as aviation and healthcare and has been the subject of enquiry in the fields of human factors and sociology. While not explicitly identified, the principles underpinning just culture have also been considered in regulatory and legal theory. This paper explores the literature and offers some observations from the regulator's perspective on why and how a regulator might adopt a just culture approach, the impact on adoption within industry, and the barriers that may prevent effective adoption by the regulator. A proposition is made that the regulator's ability to employ the full spectrum of the regulatory toolkit (from influencing and education through to administrative sanctions and prosecution) to achieve improved system safety may be enhanced by the incorporation of a just culture perspective.

The frequency of surgical adverse events along with a dysfunctional tort system, the team structure of surgical staff, and obstacles created inadvertently by existing surgical patient safety initiatives may contribute to an environment not conducive to disclosure. Fortunately, there are multiple strategies to address these barriers. Participation in communication and resolution programs, integration of Just Culture principles, surgical team disclosure planning, refinement of informed consent and morbidity and mortality processes, surgery specific professional standards, and understanding the complexities of disclosing other clinicians' errors all have the potential to help surgeons provide patients with complete, satisfactory disclosures.

Therefore, it makes sense to investigate mentoring and perceptions of emotional well being for the population. Research in this area has been ongoing for many years, however, it has never been as important as the present, as current enrollment in universities in the area and nationwide declines. Much has been written and said about the current and projected growth of the Mexican American population. One particular area of interest is the impact of population growth on the demographics of postsecondary education in the United States (Quintana, Vogel, Ybarra, 1991) For Mexican Americans, who constitute the majority of the U.S. Hispanic population, a postsecondary degree is a critical route to achieving parity, which in turn facilitates inclusion into positions of social, economic, and political power in the broader U.S. society (Apple, 1990) Well being is defined as a person's welfare, happiness, advantages, interests, utility, and quality of life. (Burris, et. al. 2009) College years (the beginning of college and the transition from childhood to adulthood) are often one of the most stressful periods of life. The stressors of the first time college experience can cause a decrease in psychological and/or emotional well being, (Chao, 2012) Non traditional students do not see themselves as traditional and do not expect to fit into college life. Many Hispanic female students are in this situation. The need to balance work and family as well as school was documented by non traditional students (Christie, Cree, Hounsell, McCune, Tett, 2008. Studies found that positive social support is crucial to manage stress, (Chao, 2012) To ensure the best outcome while enrolled in college, support is necessary to enable students to complete college successfully, as well as the transition from college life to the workforce (Bewick, Koutsopoulou, Miles, Slaa, Barkmam, 2010) The support of family, and especially their mothers, allows Hispanic women to feel somewhat as ease with actions that a Hispanic woman from a more traditional family would usually not have taken. (Okagaki, Frensch, and Gordon 1995) Online learning requires more from students in terms of self discipline and self regulation. Williams and Heilman (2004) found that self regulation is generally accepted as an important construct in student success within environments that allow learner choice, such as online courses. They investigated differences between first and second generation college students' ability to self regulate their online learning and found that first generation students report significantly lower levels of self regulation for online learning than their second generation counterparts. Purpose of Study This study is needed to contribute to and scaffold the success of female Hispanic students at the undergraduate level. The purpose of this study is to examine emotional well being along with mentoring and perceptions about mentoring influencing Hispanic female academic achievement. Fewer course drops and university withdrawals have been indicated when a support system is in place for this population. Currently the southwest border region of the United States is primarily responsible for the education of this population, therefore mentoring systems and factors that lead to emotional well being should be researched and disseminated. Hispanic students enrolled in undergraduate online classes of future teachers at the University of Texas at El Paso, a border university located within two blocks of Mexico, continue to request help while enrolled in the pre service classes. Online learners continue to participate in mentoring."", 'corpus_id': 151588268, 'venue': '', 'year': 2017.0, 'author_names': ['Patricia Ainsa', 'Arturo Olivarez'], 'n_citations': 1, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '149286131', 'title': 'Online mentoring of dissertations: the role of structure and support', 'abstract': 'ABSTRACT This study focused on the mentoring experiences of 10 faculty members during the dissertation stage of two online professional doctoral programs.

In recent years, predicting the probable DTIs through computational methods has gradually become a research hot spot. However, most of the previous studies failed to judiciously take into account the consistency between the chemical properties of drug and its functions. The changes of these relationships may lead to a severely negative effect on the prediction of DTIs. RESULTS We propose an autoencoder based method, AEFS, under spatial consistency constraints to predict DTIs. A heterogeneous network is established to integrate the information of drugs, proteins and diseases. The original drug features are projected to an embedding (protein) space by a multi layer encoder, and further projected into label (disease) space by a decoder. In this process, the clinical information of drugs is introduced to assist the DTI prediction. By maintaining the distribution of drug correlation in the original feature, embedding and label space, AEFS keeps the consistency between chemical properties and functions of drugs. Experimental comparisons indicate that AEFS is more robust for imbalanced data and of significantly superior performance in DTI prediction.

This conversion corresponds to simple matrix multiplication, and is hence differentiable implying that a frequency domain loss can be used for training in the time domain. We use mean absolute error loss between the enhanced short time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude and the clean STFT magnitude to train the CNN. This way, the model can exploit the domain knowledge of converting a signal to the frequency domain for analysis.

Three individual models of LLD RNN, MS CNN, and HSF DNN were obtained. In the models of MS CNN and LLD RNN, the attention mechanism based weighted pooling method was utilized to aggregate the CNN and RNN outputs. To effectively utilize the interdependencies between the two approaches of emotion description (discrete emotion categories and continuous emotion attributes) a multi task learning strategy was implemented in these three models to acquire generalized features by simultaneously operating classification of discrete categories and regression of continuous attributes. Finally, a confidence based fusion strategy was developed to integrate the power of different classifiers in recognizing different emotional states. Three experiments on emotion recognition based on the IEMOCAP corpus were conducted. Our experimental results show that the weighted pooling method based on attention mechanism endowed the neural networks with the capability to focus on emotionally salient parts.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) produces higher recognition rate in acoustic modeling because they are adequate to reinforce higher level representations of acoustic data. Spatial and temporal properties of the speech signal are essential for high recognition rate, so the concept of combining two different networks came into mind. In this paper, a hybrid architecture of CNN BLSTM is proposed to appropriately use these properties and to improve the continuous speech recognition task. Further, we explore different methods like weight sharing, the appropriate number of hidden units, and ideal pooling strategy for CNN to achieve a high recognition rate. Specifically, the focus is also on how many BLSTM layers are effective.

Nevertheless, the heterogeneity covers abundant semantic information, which will help FV system identify misinformation in a more accurate way. The current work is the first attempt to make the combination of knowledge graph (KG) and graph neural network (GNN) to enhance the robustness of FV systems for heterogeneous information. As a result, it can be generalized to multi domain datasets after training on a sufficient single one. To make information update and aggregate well on the collaborative graph, the present study proposes a double graph attention network (DGAT) framework which recursively propagates the embeddings from a node's neighbors to refine the node's embedding as well as applies an attention mechanism to classify the importance of the neighbors. We train and evaluate our system on FEVER, a single and benchmark dataset for FV, and then re evaluate our system on UKP Snopes Corpus, a new richly annotated corpus for FV tasks on the basis of heterogeneous web sources. According to experimental results, although DGAT has no excellent advantages in a single dataset, it shows outstanding performance in more realistic and multi domain datasets.

Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have drawn a lot of attention which are very expressive for mining a HIN, while they suffer from low efficiency issue. In this paper, we propose a pre training and fine tuning framework PF HIN to capture the features of a HIN. Unlike traditional GNNs that have to train the whole model for each downstream task, PF HIN only needs to fine tune the model using the pre trained parameters and minimal extra task specific parameters, thus improving the model efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in pre training phase, we first use a ranking based BFS strategy to form the input node sequence. Then inspired by BERT, we adopt deep bi directional transformer encoders to train the model, which is a variant of GNN aggregator that is more powerful than traditional deep neural networks like CNN and LSTM. The model is pre trained based on two tasks, i.e. masked node modeling (MNM) and adjacent node prediction (ANP) Additionally, we leverage factorized embedding parameterization and cross layer parameter sharing to reduce the parameters. In fine tuning stage, we choose four benchmark downstream tasks, i.e. link prediction, similarity search, node classification and node clustering. We use node sequence pairs as input for link prediction and similarity search, and a single node sequence as input for node classification and clustering. The experimental results of the above tasks on four real world datasets verify the advancement of PF HIN, as it outperforms state of the art alternatives consistently and significantly.', 'corpus_id': 220381288, 'venue': 'ArXiv', 'year': 2020.0, 'author_names': ['Yang Fang', 'Xiang Zhao', 'Wei Dong Xiao'], 'n_citations': 1, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '227054259', 'title': 'Scalable Graph Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Graphs', 'abstract': 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular class of parametric model for learning over graph structured data.

In this work, we ask whether these results can be extended to heterogeneous graphs, which encode multiple types of relationship between different entities. We propose Neighbor Averaging over Relation Subgraphs (NARS) which trains a classifier on neighbor averaged features for randomly sampled subgraphs of the ""metagraph"" of relations.

A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed, especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short term effectiveness of the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS CoV 2 infection. Given the BNT162b2 Phase III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS CoV 2 infection among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding days. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2.6 million member state mandated health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine between December/19/2020 and January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARS CoV 2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross sectional, web based survey of Texas physicians who provide direct patient care in family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, and internal medicine in September 2008. The three outcome variables were: HPV vaccine recommendations to 11 to 12 year old girls, likelihood of recommending the vaccine to 11 to 12 year old boys, and agreement with mandated vaccination of 11 to 12 year old girls. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to determine practice related and attitudinal factors associated with each outcome. Results: Of the 1,122 respondents, 48.5% stated they always recommended HPV vaccines to girls, 68.4% were likely to recommend the vaccine to boys, and 41.7% agreed with mandated vaccination.

BACKGROUND: The success of health care provider counseling based interventions to address vaccine hesitancy is not clear. In 2011, Washington State implemented Senate Bill 5005 (SB5005) requiring counseling and a signed form from a licensed health care provider to obtain an exemption. Evaluating the impact of a counseling intervention can provide important insight into population level interventions that focus on interpersonal communication by a health care provider. METHODS: We used segmented regression and interaction and aggregation indices to assess the impact of SB5005 on immunization coverage and exemption rates in Washington State from school years 1997 1998 through 2013 2014. RESULTS: After SB5005 was implemented, there was a significant relative decrease of 40.2% (95% confidence interval: 43.6% to 36.6% in exemption rates. This translates to a significant absolute reduction of 2.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 4.2% to 1.7% in exemption rates. There were increases in vaccine coverage for all vaccines required for school entrance, with the exception of the hepatitis B vaccine. The probability that kindergarteners without exemptions would encounter kindergarteners with exemptions (interaction index) decreased, and the probability that kindergarteners with exemptions would encounter other such kindergarteners (aggregation index) also decreased after SB5005. Moreover, SB5005 was associated with a decline in geographic clustering of vaccine exemptors.

Yet even while many wait expectantly for their turn to be vaccinated, a significant minority of Americans are hesitant. Lack of information or misinformation about the vaccine, a long standing and well entrenched antivaccination movement, distrust of public health officials, and political polarization have left many people ambivalent or opposed to vaccination.

Methods: We analyzed the Brazilian AEFI database integrating reports between 2005 and 2010 for children less than 10 years old immunized with eight mandated vaccines: diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (TETRA) diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) oral rotavirus vaccine (ORV) hepatitis B (HB) and yellow fever (YF) We compared the children's age regarding types of AEFI, evaluated AEFI factors associated with the chance of hospitalization of the child, and estimated the chance of notification of an AEFI as a function of the type of vaccine. In total, 47,105 AEFIs were observed for the mandated vaccines. Results: The highest AEFI rate was for the TETRA vaccine and the lowest was for the OPV vaccine, with 60.1 and 2.3 events per 100,000 inoculations, respectively. The TETRA vaccine showed the highest rate of hypotonic hyporesponsive episode, followed by convulsion and fever. The MMR and YF vaccines were associated with generalized rash.

Second, I explicate how mothers see their own intensive mothering practices particularly around feeding, nutrition, and natural living as an alternate and superior means of supporting their children\'s immunity.

We included patients with STEMI admitted via the Accident and Emergency Department and in whom PPCI was performed. We focus on the time period since January 25, 2020, when hospitals in the city started to institute emergency infection protocols to contain COVID 19. This required hospitals to suspend all nonessential visits and adjust clinical in patient and out patient services. Indications for PPCI were according to the international guidelines.1,2 Study exclusion criteria included inpatient STEMI (n=1) STEMI with unknown symptom onset time (n=3) and cardiac arrest patients (n=2) Our hospital has offered 24/7 PPCI service to all eligible patients presenting with acute STEMI since 2010 per standard Accident and Emergency Department protocol. When STEMI is diagnosed, a PPCI team is activated after cardiology evaluation. Data on key time points in STEMI care are recorded in a clinical registry. Symptom onset to first medicalcontact time is defined as the time from patient reported chest discomfort onset time to the time of first medical contact. Door to device time is defined as the time from Accident and Emergency Department arrival to successful wire crossing time during PPCI. Catheterization laboratory arrival to device time is defined as the time from patient arrival in the catheterization laboratory to successful wire crossing time.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID 19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID 19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20 23 and February 11 14. We analysed data on laboratory confirmed COVID 19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t) for COVID 19 and influenza A(H1N1) Findings: COVID 19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53% reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43% reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates.

Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID 19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID 19 continues to spread globally.

To verify this hypothesis, we devise unsupervised and semi supervised frameworks that learn effective views by aiming to reduce their MI. We also consider data augmentation as a way to reduce MI, and show that increasing data augmentation indeed leads to decreasing MI and improves downstream classification accuracy. As a by product, we also achieve a new state of the art accuracy on unsupervised pre training for ImageNet classification $73\\ top 1 linear readoff with a ResNet 50) In addition, transferring our models to PASCAL VOC object detection and COCO instance segmentation consistently outperforms supervised pre training.

The present study developed a microarray based system for assessing heart transplant endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) specimens. METHODS We analyzed 331 protocol or for cause EMB specimens from 221 subjects in 3 centers (Edmonton, Bologna, and Paris) Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and archetype analysis used rejection associated transcripts (RATs) shown in kidney transplants to be associated with antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) or T cell mediated rejection (TCMR) or both. To compare EMB specimens to kidney biopsy specimens, rejection status in both was simplified to TCMR, ABMR, or no rejection. RESULTS The pattern of RAT expression was similar in EMB and kidney specimens, permitting use of RATs to assign scores and group ""cluster"" membership to each EMB, independent of histology. Three clusters emerged in EMB specimens, similar to kidney specimens: TCMR, ABMR, and no rejection. This permitted each EMB specimen to be given 3 scores and assigned to 1 cluster by its highest score. There was significant agreement between molecular phenotype archetype scores or clusters and both histologic diagnoses and donor specific antibody. Area under curve estimates for predicting histologic TCMR, ABMR, and no rejection by molecular assessment were lower in EMB specimens than in kidney specimens, reflecting more uncertainty in EMB specimens, particularly in histologic diagnosis of TCMR.

Despite their diverse morphology, these animals often have a biphasic life cycle in form of a free swimming, ciliated larval stage, the trochophore, and seemingly retained a highly conserved developmental pattern called spiral cleavage. This opens the door for comparative studies to better understand the shared mechanisms of the spiralian developmental program, its deviations and the evolution of lophotrochozoan body plans. Here I studied the early development and larva formation in the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri and compared it with other members of this evolutionarily diverse group of animals. In order to conduct this research, I first built a light sheet microscope (OpenSPIM) that would allow me to follow the development of the polyclad embryo from the zygote into the larval stage and to acquire sophisticated 3d reconstructions of fixed embryonic stages. I then used this and other techniques to characterise in detail the early development of M. crozieri and its conserved spiral cleavage pattern. Precise volume measurements of 3d reconstructed early blastomeres and the investigations of associated cleavage patterns indicate that this polyclad worm may not follow a strictly equal spiral cleavage type, as was previously thought. I investigated the cleavage pattern and fate of micromere 4d, which in M. crozieri gives rise to mesoderm and generates bilaterally symmetric embryos at a cellular level. A first cell lineage analysis of this organism involved long term live imaging recordings and point to a conserved fate of blastomeres that, like in other spiral cleavers, give rise to ectodermally derived structures, specifically the larva's locomotion system (ciliary band) and a sensory organ at the apical point (apical organ) These findings strengthen the idea that these structures may be homologous to those found in other trochophore larvae.

While a wide range of bioanalysis methods have been successfully miniaturized and implemented in a lab on a chip format, there has not been a commercially viable approach to miniaturizing microscopy until recently.

The heat wave events were identified based on daily maximum temperature, and they were divided into three classes considering the intensity threshold: moderate heat waves (daily maximum temperature exceeding the 90th percentile) severe heat waves (daily maximum temperature over the 95th percentile) and extremely severe heat waves (daily maximum temperature exceeding the 98th percentile) The minimum length of an event was of minimum three consecutive days. The surface urban heat island was detected based on land surface temperature derived from Landsat 8 thermal infrared data, while the economic impact was estimated based on data on work force structure and work productivity in Cluj Napoca derived from the data released by Eurostat, National Bank of Romania, and National Institute of Statistics. The results indicate that the intensity and spatial extension of surface urban heat island could be governed by the magnitude of the heat wave event, but due to the low number of satellite images available, we should consider this information only as preliminary results. Thermal infrared remote sensing has proven to be a very efficient method to study surface urban heat island, due to the fact that the synoptic conditions associated with heat wave events usually favor cloud free image. The resolution of the OLI_TIRS sensor provided good results for a mid extension city, but the low revisiting time is still a drawback. The potential economic loss was calculated for the working days during heat waves and the estimated loss reached more than 2.5 mil. EUR for each heat wave day at city scale, cumulating more than 38 mil. EUR for the three cases considered.', 'corpus_id': 125499899, 'venue': 'Theoretical and Applied Climatology', 'year': 2017.0, 'author_names': ['Ioana Herbel', 'Adina Croitoru', 'Adina Viorica Rus', 'Cristina Florina Rosca', 'Gabriela Victoria Harpa', 'Antoniu-Flavius Ciupertea', 'I Rus'], 'n_citations': 18, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '133414347', 'title': 'Detection of atmospheric urban heat island through direct measurements in Cluj Napoca city, Romania', 'abstract': 'In the last decades, cities worldwide have experienced accelerated development, so that continuous urbanization and its impact is presently one of the most important topics in diff erent fi elds of research.

Therefore, building, especially the green building (GB) is predominantly provisioned to address the increasing energy consumption and carbon emissions in response to climate change, while to our best knowledge, it has been scarcely requested for UHI mitigation (UHIM) Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of GB based UHIM system, or 'zero UHI impact building' or 'zero heat building' or 'microclimate neutral building' aiming to achieve the zero heat impact on surrounding environments through reasonably designing and operating buildings, or depending on innovative techniques to eliminate the excessive heats, on the basis of GB's goals. In specific, this paper defines the boundary of the GB based UHIM system, analyzes the interactions between building and urban heat fluxes, and the factors that may affect the use of UHIM techniques on building components. The potentials to establish the GB based UHIM system are further analyzed in aspects of the UHI impacts on the GB benefits and the principle for heat mitigation.

Researchers have paid much attention to the magnitude of the UHI effect, but ignored its spatial extent (i.e. footprint) which is another important aspect of the UHI effect. In this study, we systematically analyzed the footprint of surface UHI (SUHI) effect in 302 Chinese cities, especially temporal trends of the footprint, by using multi source remote sensing data. The footprint of SUHI effect (FP) was estimated by the Gaussian surface, and its temporal trend was examined by the Mann Kendal and the Sen's slope estimator non parametric tests. We found the FP showed evident diurnal (daytime nighttime) seasonal (summer winter) and inter city (big cities small and medium sized cities) differences. During the period 2003 2016, over 80% of the 302 cities exhibited increasing trends of the FP in annual days and summer days, and the increasing trends were statistically significant (p 0.05) in about half of these cities. In the nights, the FP increased in more than 70% of the cities, and about one third of the 302 cities experienced significantly increasing trends of the FP. On average, the annual daytime and annual nighttime FPs increased at a rate of 5.0% per year and 3.8% per year, respectively. More importantly, the correlation analysis indicated that the increase of anthropogenic heat emissions and the decrease of vegetation activities and surface albedos should take lead responsibility for the expansion of the FP in the urbanization process. These results reveal that the spatial extent of heat island effect has expanded significantly in numerous Chinese cities, and this increasing trend will be sustained in the coming years if no more effective measures are carried out."", 'corpus_id': 53759738, 'venue': 'The Science of the total environment', 'year': 2019.0, 'author_names': ['Qiquan Yang', 'Xin Huang', 'Qiuhong Tang'], 'n_citations': 68, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '53112996', 'title': 'Quantifying urban heat island intensity and its physical mechanism using WRF/UCM.', 'abstract': 'Reliable quantification of urban heat island intensity (UHII) is crucial for the evaluation of extreme heat waves and the related heat stress. As a powerful approach for the study of urban climate, numerical models can simulate urban heat island (UHI) in both high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, accurate quantification of UHII using modelling grid data is still a challenge at present, due to the different criterions for the selection of urban/rural grids. This study simulates the high resolution UHI in the city of Berlin using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Urban Canopy Module. A new method to quantify UHII, which is based on the fitted linear functions of simulated 2 m air temperature (T2m) using the impervious surface area in WRF grids (ISAWRF) was adopted and evaluated. The simulated T2m matches the observations well, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 (P 0.01) and RMSE of 1.76 degC. The study area shows a strong UHI at nighttime. The simulated nighttime T2m increases with the increase in the ISAWRF. The linear functions of simulated nighttime T2m against ISAWRF are well fitted. The UHII is calculated as the products of the slopes of fitted functions and the largest ISAWRF. The derived UHII shows U shaped diurnal variations, with high values at nighttime. The difference of simulated surface temperature and sensible heat flux between the impervious surface and the vegetation surface jointly determines the derived UHII. The large difference of surface temperature and the small difference of sensible heat flux between the impervious and the vegetation surface generate the high UHII at nighttime and vice versa during the daytime. The method of ISAWRF based function of T2m overcomes the problems of traditional methods in arbitrary selecting urban/rural grids.

Here, we reconcile this debate by demonstrating that the difference between the recent finding and the traditional paradigm can be explained by the difference in the attribution methods.

A number of more fragmentary genera are also included in this clade from the Jurassic around the world. This monograph is a description of the Early Cretaceous allosauroid Neovenator salerii, a recently announced large theropod from the Wealden of England (Hutt, et al. 1996; Naish, et al. 2001) This theropod merits attention as it is the most completely known large theropod from the Early Cretaceous of Europe, and it also extends the temporal range of the allosauroids from the Jurassic. The organization of the monograph clearly follows previous descriptions of Allosaurus (Madsen, 1976) and Ceratosaurus (Madsen and Welles, 2000) The authors present a detailed description of the available material, along with extensive comparisons of other large basal theropods including Ceratosaurus (Madsen and Welles, 2000) Allosaurus (Madsen, 1976) Sinraptor (Currie and Zhao, 1993) Torvosaurus (Britt, 1991) and Acrocanthosaurus (Harris, 1998; Currie and Carpenter, 2000) among others. One oversight was the citation of Colbert, 1989, in the text but not in the References section in the mention of Coelophysis as an outgroup taxon. Much of the text is devoted to describing the material at hand, without making a priori assessments as to their phylogenetic utility, which in my opinion, can be useful in relating any future material. Proposed derived characters are noted and extensively discussed. Intraspecific variability is taken into account as much as possible and the observed pathologies described. Without the phylogenetic analysis of the allosauroids (Brusatte and Sereno, 2008) however, the characters are difficult to critique because there is little comparison with more derived theropods. In the practical sense of identifying or supporting hypothesized trends in theropod evolution, such comparisons would have been useful to include. Although the locality information is probably reasonably good, I am not sure that the presented geological column is terribly informative. It portrays the relative position of the Wessex and Vectis formations, and the position of the Neovenator bonebed, but little more. However, the photographs and accompanying text imply that more petrologic and facies information could have been presented in the column. The available fossil material is extensively illustrated with photographs and line drawings. The abbreviations associated with the structures are located within the captions, which is convenient, saving constantly looking at lists of abbreviations in other parts of the text. Unfortunately, the photographs are on a black background, making them dark because they lack sufficient contrast to stand out against it. As noted above, the results of a phylogenetic analysis of the Allosauroidea are presented elsewhere (Brusatte and Sereno, 2008) however, a cladogram is provided in the present monograph. I assume that it represents a consensus tree, but no information is given as to how it was obtained, nodal support, or the associated global indices. However, it is one of the few phylogenetic analyses including Neovenator. It shows Neovenator as a basal carcharodontosaurid, a status that was also supported in previous analyses by Rauhut (2003) and Holtz et al. (2004) Generally, this discussion of Neovenator updates a poorly known taxon from the Early Cretaceous, an important time period from which relatively little fossil material is currently known. Additionally, it provides extensive anatomical and comparative information for any future research program concerned with basal theropods.

Integrating these processes to reduce costs, in addition to providing sufficient supply, are of the major goals of agri food supply chain management. Rice is an important grain that constitutes an important part of people's diets throughout the world. FAO predicts that global rice utilization would increase over the next few years. Considering rice's importance, in this paper, a mixed integer linear mathematical model for designing and planning of rice supply chain is proposed which aims to maximize total profit by integrating different decisions of the rice supply chain including supplier selection, cropping, fertilizing, pest control, harvesting, milling, transportation, and distribution. This model considers different rice varieties and takes into account irrigation water requirements of crops and available water resources. A case study of Iran farmlands in Gilan province is employed to show the applicability and advantages of the proposed model for the rice supply chain.

In this regard, rice as one of the important agricultural products is generally cultivated by rural farmers in small farmlands. Due to the high demand, high price, type of products, and also wide geographic range of production and consumption, the rice supply chain has special characteristics in ASC. In this regard, this paper not only firstly considers rice supply chain and but also proposes a bi level optimization model for rice supply chain. The proposed model aims to minimize total cost with respect to the two decision makers' opinions. Since, the bi level programming is NP hard, to solve the proposed model, two well known meta heuristic algorithms including Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) along with two hybrid algorithms (PSO GA and GA PSO) and a modified algorithm (GPA) are utilized. In order to fill the literature gaps and to get closer to real world applications, an applicable example in Iran is studied. Based on the results and managerial insights, the GPA is chosen as the best method and its allocated value of the variable are reported. The results show that the proposed model and solution methods are valid, practical, and effective.

A more integrated and holistic consideration of supply chain community interactions incorporating multiple supply chains and communities adds to the perspective of community development through SCR. It not only leverages community development as a significant level of analysis in supply chains, but also considers all chains that interact with a community.

ABM is a bottom up approach for modeling the dynamics of interactions among individuals and complex combinations of various factors (e.g. economic, social or environmental) Our agent based contract farming model focuses on two critical components of contractual relationship, namely financial incentives and trust. We incorporate the actual recurrent fluctuations of spot market prices, which induce both contractor and farmer agents to renege on the agreement. The agent based model is then used to predict emergent system wide behaviors and compare counterfactual scenarios of different policies and initiatives on maintaining the contract rice farming scheme. Simulation results firstly show that a fully equipped contractor who opportunistically exploits a relatively small proportion (less than 10% of the contracted farmers in most instances can outperform spot market based contractors in terms of average profit achieved for each crop. Secondly, a committed contractor who offers lower purchasing prices than the most typical rate can obtain better earnings per ton of rice as well as higher profit per crop. However, those contractors in both cases could not enlarge their contract farming scheme, since either farmers' trust toward them decreases gradually or their offers are unable to compete with the benefits from a competitor or the spot market. Thirdly, the results are also in agreement with the existing literature that the contract farming scheme is not a cost effective method for buyers with limited rice processing capacity, which is a common situation among the contractors in the MKD region.

To maintain brevity, the majority of the measures reviewed here were selected to provide broad coverage of general symptoms of anxiety, and measures were excluded if they are intended to identify or characterize a specific Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM IV) anxiety disorder (1) Specifically, this author excluded measures typically used to evaluate diagnostic criteria or features of specific anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and others. In addition, broader measures of psychiatric distress, including the Symptom Checklist 90, the General Health Questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 are not included in this review since they are included elsewhere in this special issue. However, subscales that have been used frequently in rheumatology as ""stand alone"" measures, such as the anxiety scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, are included in this review. Importantly, the measures included in this review should not be interpreted as diagnostically significant for an anxiety disorder, even generalized anxiety disorder, but should be used to measure the presence of symptoms and to calibrate the severity of general symptoms of anxiety commonly occurring in rheumatic disease. The measures reviewed below include the State Trait Anxiety Index, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Interpretation can be aided by knowing how a given measure is related to other measures of known reliability and validity. Corah has published a short four item test to measure dental anxiety (CORAH, J Dent Res 48: 596, 1969) As part of a larger study of reactions to outpatient dental emergency care, the dental anxiety scale (DAS) and the state trait anxiety inventory (STAI) (SPIELBERGER, GORSUCH and LUSHENE, STAI Manual for the StateTrait Anxiety Inventory, 1970) were administered to 73 adult patients (39 men, 34 women) who were awaiting dental treatment.

The study also included the palmer sweat index (PSI) which is a measure of automatic arousal (SUTARMAN and THOMSON, J Physiol (Lond) 117: 51, 1952) The STAI test is used, since it has known reliability, validity, and a Spanish translation. It assesses two aspects of anxiety state and trait anxiety. State anxiety refers to the complex emotional reactions that fluctuate over time as a function of stresses that impinge on the individual. This type of anxiety, which consists of tension, worry, and nervousness, is measured by 20 items in which the person rates the intensity of his feelings at the moment. The scores range from 20 to 80.

Para ello se calculo la consistencia interna y la factorizacion asi como el funcionamiento diferencial de los items en una muestra de adultos espanoles. Tras la comprobacion de la fiabilidad se paso a extraer un conjunto de items que permitiesen evaluar la ansiedad estado y rasgo. Tras ello, se comparo el ajuste de dicha seleccion de items con otras versiones breves anteriormente validadas. Tanto la version obtenida como las versiones breves propuestas por otros autores fueron comprobadas en una muestra de adolescentes y otra de universitarios. Por ultimo, se emplearon dos muestras de pacientes: la primera con pacientes con alguno de los diagnosticos de depresion recogidos en el DSM IV TR y la segunda con pacientes con alguno de los diagnosticos de ansiedad recogidos en dicho manual. En estas muestras se comprobo la fiabilidad y validez. Para lograr la consecucion de los objetivos propuestos y realizar estos pasos descritos se ha realizado seis estudios, agrupados en tres objetivos generales. A continuacion se resume cada uno de los estudios de forma independiente: Objetivo 1: Comprobacion de la fiabilidad y validez del State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Estudio 1: Diferencias entre pacientes con ansiedad y poblacion general mediante STAI: Meta analisis de comparacion de grupos y generalizacion de la fiabilidad. Fundamentos: Desde su creacion el STAI se ha citado en mas de 14.000 documentos, contando con mas de 60 adaptaciones en diversos paises. En algunas de ellas este instrumento no cuenta con puntuaciones clinicas. El objetivo de este trabajo es determinar si el STAI tiene puntuaciones superiores en pacientes diagnosticados con ansiedad respecto a poblacion general. Ademas, se pretende analizar si la consistencia interna es adecuada en personas con ansiedad. Metodo: Se realizo una busqueda bibliografica en Tripdatabase, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, PyscINFO and Scholar Google, para documentos publicados entre 2008 y 2012. Se seleccionaron 131 articulos para la comparacion entre pacientes diagnosticados con ansiedad respecto a poblacion general y 25 para la generalizacion de la fiabilidad. Para los analisis se utilizo la d de Cohen para la comparacion de medias (metodo de efectos aleatorios) y el alfa de Cronbach para la generalizacion de la fiabilidad (metodo de efectos fijos) Resultados: En la comparacion entre grupos en la ansiedad estado las diferencias fueron estadisticamente significativas (d 1,39; IC95% 1,22 1,56) En la ansiedad rasgo fue d 1,74 (IC95% 1,56 1,91) Ademas de ello, la fiabilidad para pacientes con algun trastorno de ansiedad abarco de 0,87 a 0,93. Conclusiones: el STAI es sensible al nivel de ansiedad de la persona y fiable para muestras de pacientes diagnosticados con crisis de angustia, fobia especifica, fobia social, fobia social generalizada, trastorno de ansiedad generalizada, trastorno de estres post traumaticos, trastorno obsesivo compulsivo o trastorno por estres agudo. Estudio 2: Actualizacion psicometrica y funcionamiento diferencial de los items en el State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) La ansiedad es uno de los problemas psicologicos con mayor prevalencia. Entre los instrumentos para medirla se encuentra el State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Este cuestionario mide ansiedad rasgo (factor de personalidad que predispone a sufrir o no ansiedad) y ansiedad estado (los factores ambientales que protegen o generan ansiedad) La adaptacion espanola del cuestionario se realizo en 1982, por ello el objetivo del estudio es realizar una revision del STAI. Para ello, se reunio una muestra de 1.036 adultos. Se realizo un analisis de fi abilidad mediante alfa de Cronbach (0,90 para ansiedad rasgo y 0,94 para ansiedad estado) Tambien se realizo una reduccion factorial con unos resultados similares a los de la adaptacion original. Ademas, se comprobo si existia funcionamiento diferencial de item por sexo y unicamente una de las 40 preguntas mostro problemas. Por ultimo se realizo comparaciones t Student con los valores de la adaptacion; mientras el rasgo varia en 1 punto, el estado tiene diferencias de hasta 6 puntos. En estos resultados de forma general se observa que el STAI mantiene unas adecuadas propiedades metricas y que, ademas, ha sido sensible al aumento de estimulos ambientales que producen estres. Objetivo 2: Creacion y ajuste de una version breve del State Trait Anxiety Inventory en muestra espanola. Estudio 3: Version breve de la adaptacion espanola del State Trait Anxiety Inventory. El State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) es uno de los instrumentos de evaluacion mas empleados por psicologos. Desde su creacion, se han llevado a cabo varias versiones breves del mismo; pese a ello, no existe ninguna para poblacion general, en muestra espanola. El objetivo del presente estudio es establecer y validar una version breve. Para ello, se aplico el STAI completo a 1.157 adultos. En funcion de las puntuaciones en el STAI se realizaron grupos de alta y baja ansiedad. Mediante dichos grupos, se realizo un analisis discriminante. Para la ansiedad estado y rasgo, respectivamente, se obtuvieron reducciones de cinco items. Seguidamente, se comparo esta reduccion de items con otras versiones breves, mediante analisis factorial confirmatorio. La version establecida mediante analisis discriminante ajusta adecuadamente. No obstante, hay una seleccion de 12 items (seis por subescala) en la que se observa un mejor ajuste. Asi pues, los items 2, 4, 11, 15, 17 y 18 (para ansiedad estado) y los items 7, 14, 15, 16, 17 y 18 (para ansiedad rasgo) son los items mas adecuados para establecer una version breve en muestra espanola. En conclusion, se puede emplear estos 12 items para favorecer evaluaciones muy largas o de personas con problemas de salud que no puedan realizar evaluaciones muy largas. Estudio 4: Version breve del STAI en adolescentes y universitarios espanoles. El STAI es uno de los instrumentos de evaluacion psicologica mas empleados, generandose diversas versiones breves del mismo. No se han hallado versiones breves en las que se haya comprobado el ajuste para muestras de adolescentes ni universitarios espanoles. El objetivo de este estudio es comprobar cual de las versiones cortas propuestas en la literatura tiene un mejor ajuste en adolescentes y universitarios. Para ello, se aplico el STAI a 482 adolescentes escolarizados y 510 estudiantes universitarios, de diversas ciudades espanolas. Mediante AFC se evaluo el ajuste de cinco versiones breves del STAI. En los universitarios hay dos modelos en los que se observa un buen ajuste. En los adolescentes no ajusta ningun modelo. Puede que el proceso de diferenciacion emocional con la edad explique que en los adolescentes las versiones breves halladas (siempre con adultos) no serian validas, si pudiendo emplearse con universitarios. Objetivo 3: Fiabilidad y validez del State Trait Anxiety Inventory en muestras clinicas. Estudio 5: Estructura factorial del State Trait Anxiety Inventory en pacientes diagnosticados con depresion. Introduccion: Pese a ser uno de los cuestionarios para evaluar ansiedad mas empleados por profesionales de la salud mental, el STAI ha sido objeto de criticas, entre las que destaca la posible existencia de un conjunto de items que por evaluar depresion conformarian un factor independiente. El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar la factorizacion del STAI en una muestra de pacientes con diagnostico de depresion. Material y metodos: Para ello se aplico la adaptacion espanola del STAI a 266 pacientes espanoles, diagnosticados con diferentes trastornos depresivos. Resultados: Mediante un analisis factorial exploratorio se determinaron tres factores subyacentes: ansiedad estado, ansiedad rasgo positiva y ansiedad rasgo negativa. Conclusiones: Asi pues, la factorizacion realizada no permite confirmar la presencia de conjuntos de items especificos para la depresion, senalada anteriormente como la principal critica a este cuestionario. Ademas, los elevados valores del alfa categorico, tanto en la estructura factorial obtenida, como en las subescalas teoricas, son indicios de una elevada fiabilidad para el empleo del STAI en pacientes con diagnostico de depresion. Estudio 6: Fiabilidad y validez del State Trait Anxiety Inventory en pacientes diagnosticados con ansiedad. Resumen: Introduccion: La adaptacion espanola del STAI ha demostrado ser fiable y valida en poblacion general espanola, no obstante no ha sido validada para pacientes con diagnostico de ansiedad. El objetivo es analizar los items la fiabilidad y la validez de constructos en pacientes con diagnostico de ansiedad. Metodo: Para lograr el objetivo se aplico el STAI, asi como varios cuestionarios de ansiedad y depresion a una muestra de 251 pacientes con diagnostico principal de ansiedad. Resultados: La media de la ansiedad rasgo y estado son elevadas, siendo significativamente diferentes del valor de la adaptacion espanola para poblacion normal. La fiabilidad es superior a 0,9 en ambas escalas. Hay relaciones moderadas entre el STAI y el BAI, asi como con el IDER y el CBD. Discusion: El STAI es fiable en pacientes con ansiedad, no obstante las correlaciones con instrumentos de depresion hace pensar que es posible que evalue depresion. La correlacion con el BAI es elevada por lo que en pacientes con ansiedad la evaluacion de los nieles de ansiedad son validas.', 'corpus_id': 151560264, 'venue': '', 'year': 2014.0, 'author_names': ['Alejandro Guillen Riquelme'], 'n_citations': 0, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '143866308', 'title': 'Alternate Forms of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory', 'abstract': 'Alternate forms of the state anxiety (A State) and trait anxiety (A Trait) scales of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were constructed by dividing the 20 items of each scale into two briefer forms having 10 items each.

The STAIC was administered to the children prior to their completing a novel nonverbal task. The items were scored according to the directions in the manual and subjected to a principal components factor analysis with oblique and varimax rotation. Using the scree test, the oblique rotation produced the best simple structure of three factors, and there were no significant differences in factor structure by sex. The results were consistent with prior research and indicated a stable trait factor that closely matched the original A Trait scale and two state factors. These factors were identified as ""state unhappiness"" and ""state distress"" and were compared to previous research that labeled the two factors as ""anxiety present"" and ""anxiety absent."" There was a nonlinear relationship between these two factors, indicating that once state happiness increases beyond the minimum scores, state distress increases at a more rapid rate than the simple correlation (r .52) would suggest.

Since domain experts are an expensive resource in terms of monetary costs and latency, it is desired to design algorithms that minimize the interaction with them. In this paper we address the problem of minimizing the number of annotation tasks with respect to a set of queries.We present a dedicated algorithm based on efficient labeling, that dictates the strategy for constructing a minimal set of classifiers sufficing to answer all queries.

For example, the query bicycle is rewritten to match (bicycle OR bike) i.e. all items that either contain the word bicycle or bike in their title are returned for this query. Choosing the right set of synonymous terms for a given query term is essential to ensure the quality of search results, especially in the context of e commerce where buyer needs can be very specific. As an example, shoe is a good synonym for shoes, whereas sandals, while related, is not a good synonym for shoes. In this work, we describe one version of the approaches to query rewriting taken at eBay search. At a high level, we use a two step process to generate and apply synonyms for query expansions 1. offline token level synonym generation and 2. runtime search query rewriting.

Here, we provide an integrative theoretical framework and systems based neurobiological model that explains the mechanisms by which mindfulness reduces biases related to self processing and creates a sustainable healthy mind. Mindfulness is described through systematic mental training that develops meta awareness (self awareness) an ability to effectively modulate one's behavior (self regulation) and a positive relationship between self and other that transcends self focused needs and increases prosocial characteristics (self transcendence) This framework of self awareness, regulation, and transcendence (S ART) illustrates a method for becoming aware of the conditions that cause (and remove) distortions or biases. The development of S ART through meditation is proposed to modulate self specifying and narrative self networks through an integrative fronto parietal control network. Relevant perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral neuropsychological processes are highlighted as supporting mechanisms for S ART, including intention and motivation, attention regulation, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation, prosociality, non attachment, and decentering.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to describe the methods of a project designed to investigate the role of social, behavioral, and environmental factors in modifying the adverse effects of stress on new nurses and to discuss demographic, health, and life stress characteristics of the cohort at baseline. METHODS A prospective cohort design was used to conduct a comprehensive assessment of health endpoints, life stress, behaviors, personal traits, social factors, indicators of engagement and performance, and environmental exposures in nursing students. Adjusted odds ratios and analyses of covariance were used to examine associations between these factors at baseline. RESULTS Health indicators in the cohort were comparable or better than in the broader United States population, and lifetime stress exposure was lower than among students from other majors. Exposure to more lifetime stressors was associated with greater risk for various health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Conversely, better social, environmental, behavioral, and personal profiles were associated with protective effects for the same health conditions.

OBJECTIVES To describe the methods of a study designed to investigate the role of social, behavioral, and environmental factors in modifying the adverse effects of stress on new nurses and discuss demographic, health, and life stress characteristics of the cohort at baseline. METHODS A prospective cohort design was used to conduct a comprehensive assessment of health endpoints, life stress, behaviors, personal traits, social factors, indicators of engagement and performance, and environmental exposures in nursing students. Adjusted odds ratios and analyses of covariance were used to examine associations between these factors at baseline. RESULTS Health indicators in the cohort were comparable or better than in the U.S. and lifetime stress exposure was lower than among students from other majors. Exposure to more lifetime stressors was associated with greater risk for various health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and depression. Conversely, better social, environmental, behavioral, and personal profiles were associated with protective effects for the same health conditions.

BACKGROUND Stress from clinical practice and its impact are international yet culturally mediated phenomena. Nursing students are under considerable stress during clinical practice periods, putting their education and health at risk. However, there is little or no empirical evidence about the stress suffered by nursing students and its impact on their health throughout clinical practice. METHODS We performed cross sectional research using standard information gathering tools. This study was carried out with 357 students from all 3 years of a nursing diploma programme at a Spanish nursing college (71% response rate) The data were collected over an 8 month period in 2004 2005. FINDINGS We identified three types of stressors (clinical, academic and external) and two categories of symptoms (physiological and psychological) linked to clinical practice. Factor analysis identified six major sources of stress and six important symptoms. Students perceived clinical stressors more intensely than academic and external stressors, and showed psychological symptoms more frequently than physiological symptoms. Nursing students from all 3 years perceived moderate stress at similar levels. Experienced students perceived more academic stressors than novices. Although the students were healthy, second year students were the most vulnerable to somatic and psychic anxiety, and common symptoms.

Specifically, the thesis focuses on nursing students and trainee clinical psychologists. The quantitative studies adopt a particular methodological approach that is used at the Centre for Occupational Health Psychology at Cardiff University. The method is multi dimensional in nature, and attempts to ""tap in"" to the multiple levels of the stress process without overburdening the participants or the service they provide. This approach is described in great detail throughout the thesis, and therefore this work can also act as a template for future studies that may adopt this method to investigate other populations. It is suggested that taking a multi dimensional approach to assessing stress might be a good way to inform regulatory standards, curriculum design, and student support. To complement the quantitative studies, qualitative studies were run to investigate stressors and coping strategies in mental health nursing students and trainee clinical psychologists. Many of the reported stressors were common across the two groups whereas others were specific to the individual population. For example, similarities between the groups included conflict with members of staff, problems in their home life, and \'being a student/trainee\' whereas differences included the level of support received. That is, trainee clinical psychologists generally reported feeling well supported, whereas mental health nursing students reported inadequate support.

After baseline measurement, 72 participants were randomized to one of the following groups (n 18 each) (i) animal assisted therapy; (ii) music therapy; (iii) mandala painting; (iv) control group. Outcomes of all groups in terms of stress reduction were compared by measuring self reported perceived stress (STAI State and visual analogue stress scale) and salivary biomarker levels (Cortisol and Immunoglobulin A) RESULTS Fifty seven complete data sets (n 12 16 for each group) were analysed. All distraction focused interventions showed stress and anxiety reduction in everyday school situations. By contrast, on days with examinations, stress reductions did not reach statistical significance in regard to self reported psychological stress.

This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, ""model,"" ""type,"" and ""definition"" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.

This strategy could cause financial pressure on a firm's suppliers or distributors, hurt the supply chain, and even have an adverse effect on the firm itself. We attempt to find out the optimal deploying of working capital in a supply chain perspective. A supply chain with one supplier and one retailer who faces uncertain demand is considered. The payment period of the retailer is determined to maximize the profits, besides the wholesale price and the order quantity. We build three models to capture different cooperation levels of the supply chain: non cooperative, negotiatory and centralized. The equilibrium solutions show that the payment period should be maximized when the retailer's discount rate is higher than the supplier's and vice versa, regardless of the cooperation levels. In consideration of different claims of profit sharing, we propose the supply chain oriented solution of working capital management."", 'corpus_id': 127108371, 'venue': 'Eur. J. Oper.

It also aims to capture the change in the financing of working capital requirement over different scenarios of price cost margin and financial flexibility.,The study is undertaken on a sample of 1,211 firms from 6 key manufacturing sectors of Indian economy from 2000 to 2016. The non linear relationship between WCF and profitability is studied using two step generalized model of moments (GMM) estimator.,The study finds a convex relationship between WCF and profitability among firms in chemical, construction, and consumer goods sectors. Firms in these sectors can finance larger portion of their working capital requirements through short term debt without negatively impacting profitability. However, a concave pattern of relationship for firms in machinery, metal, and textile industries implies increasing debt financing of working capital requirement would increase profitability for the firms who have financed lower portion of their working capital by short term bank borrowing. But when a higher proportion of working capital requirements are already financed by short term debt, a further increase in debt financing may impact profitability negatively. Moreover, the study finds that firms with high financial flexibility and high price cost margin (except textile) can increase profitability by financing larger portion of working capital requirement through short term debts and the continuation with risky WCF could increase profitability.,The study contributes to the literature on working capital in a number of ways.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine how profitability of banks can be enhanced through the working capital management. To empirically carry out the analysis, panel data which consist of ten (10) deposit money banks in Nigeria for seven years (2010 2016) employing the panel fixed effect, panel random effect and the pooled OLS for the two models, which were used as proxies for bank profitability, which includes return on asset (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) to examine the best measure for bank profitability, with the indicators of working capital; net interest income, current ratio, profit after tax, and monetary policy rate. Results of the study showed that working capital management has a significant effect on the profitability of the selected banks and that return on asset is a better measure for bank profitability.

In this study, we tested whether humans can learn cued eating desires to negative moods as conditioned stimuli (CS) thereby offering a potential explanation of emotional eating (EE) Female participants were randomly presented with 10 different stimuli eliciting either negative or neutral emotional states, with one of these states paired with eating chocolate. Expectancy to eat, desire to eat, salivation, and unpleasantness of experiencing negative emotions were assessed. After conditioning, participants were brought into a negative emotional state and were asked to choose between money and chocolate. Data showed differential conditioned responding on the expectancy and desire measures, but not on salivation. Specific conditioned effects were obtained for participants with a higher BMI (body mass index) on the choice task, and for participants high on EE on the unpleasantness ratings.

Nevertheless, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we hypothesize that alexithymia may be characterized by an alteration in learning the emotional value of encountered stimuli and test this by assessing differences between individuals with low (LA) and high (HA) levels of alexithymia in the computation of reward prediction errors (RPEs) during Pavlovian appetitive conditioning. As a marker of RPE, the amplitude of the feedback related negativity (FRN) event related potential was assessed while participants were presented with two conditioned stimuli (CS) associated with expected or unexpected feedback, indicating delivery of reward or no reward. No reward (vs reward) feedback elicited the FRN both in LA and HA. However, unexpected (vs expected) feedback enhanced the FRN in LA but not in HA, indicating impaired computation of RPE in HA. Thus, although HA show preserved sensitivity to rewards, they cannot use this response to update the value of CS that predict them.

A prefrontal cortex (PFC) amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes. However, limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress. Therefore, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate stress induced changes in PFC amygdala function during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Participants completed a variant of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) followed (25min later) by a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during fMRI. Self reported stress to the MIST was used to identify three stress reactivity groups (Low, Medium, and High) Psychophysiological, behavioral, and fMRI signal responses were compared between the three stress reactivity groups during fear conditioning. Fear learning, indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning, increased with stress reactivity. Further, the High stress reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal (i.e. skin conductance response, SCR) to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the Low and Medium stress reactivity groups. Finally, the High stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat. More specifically, the High stress reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned SCRs.

However, the HED group rated the CS+ as significantly more disgusting and fear inducing than the CS after the acquisition phase and this pattern persisted after extinction.

This technique, unlike other methods, can provide an elasticity image in less than a millisecond, thus opening the possibility of studying dynamic cellular processes and elucidating new mechanocellular properties. We call this proposed technique ""cell quake elastography."" Elasticity is a fundamental cellular property that is related to the anatomy, functionality, and pathological state of cells and tissues. However, current techniques based on cell deformation, atomic force microscopy, or Brillouin scattering are rather slow and do not always accurately represent cell elasticity. Here, we have developed an alternative technique by applying shear wave elastography to the micrometer scale. Elastic waves were mechanically induced in live mammalian oocytes using a vibrating micropipette.

Traditional characterization techniques leave a critical experimental gap in understanding the complex subsurface fluid flow and metal evaporation dynamics inherent in laser induced heating of the metal. Herein, in situ ultra high speed transmission X ray imaging is revealed to be essential for bridging this information gap, particularly via comparison with and validation of advanced multiphysics simulations. Imaging on submicrosecond timescales enables correlation between dynamics of the laser generated vapor liquid interface and melt pool surface instabilities in industrially relevant alloys. X ray imaging and complimentary simulations reveal vapor depression oscillations and rapid expansion due to reflection of the processing laser from the front surface of the vapor depression. Pore formation studies at steady state and during prompt removal of laser heating at the end of track reveal that the rapidly solidifying melt pool traps pores near the base of the vapor filled depression. Moreover, pores within the melt pool are entrained by Marangoni convection which overcomes the force of buoyancy and forces the pores downward from the surface immediately before solidification. Observed solidification kinetics, consistent with previous results, give insight into surface morphology and porosity in the processed material.

Multimodal devices, if well coordinated, can help optimize e dictionary examples in informativity, diversity, dynamicity and interactivity.

Evidence shows that multimodal exemplification can expand the three metafunctional meanings of the e dictionary discourse: ideational, interpersonal and textual. Ideational meaning can be enriched by not only multimodal examples per se but also cross modal example definition ties, and hyperlinks facilitate meaning flow in the semantic network. Interpersonal meaning can be expanded by user participation and design options, including those for page layout (spatial mode) and example genre style (verbal mode) Textual meaning can be reinforced by information value, composition, salience and framing.

Due to their planar geometry and relative abundance in limestone reservoirs, their impact on regional fluid flow has attracted considerable interest. We present laboratory permeability data that show that stylolites can be considered as conduits for flow in the stylolite bearing limestones measured. A combination of analysis techniques shows that this is due to a zone that surrounds these stylolites that is more porous and contains larger pores than the host rock. Our data also show that the water permeability of a sample containing a stylolite parallel to fluid flow is typically lower than its permeability to gas, explained here as a result of the expansion of minor amounts of clay found in the stylolite, and that, due to their microstructural similarities, tectonic and sedimentary stylolites affect sample permeability similarly. Finally, we show that the permeability anisotropy that develops in the rock mass due to the presence of sedimentary stylolites makes it appear as though the stylolites are acting as barriers to fluid flow, and may explain the discrepancy between laboratory measurements and field scale observations. This approach can provide estimates for the equivalent permeability, and permeability anisotropy, for stylolite bearing limestone reservoirs worldwide.', 'corpus_id': 135047226, 'venue': '', 'year': 2018.0, 'author_names': ['Michael J Heap', 'Thierry Reuschle', 'Patrick Baud', 'Francois Renard', 'Gianluca Iezzi'], 'n_citations': 17, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '133144090', 'title': 'Saltwater Intrusion as Potential Driver of Phosphorus Release from Limestone Bedrock in a Coastal Aquifer', 'abstract': 'Abstract An important but often overlooked consequence of saltwater intrusion is the potential increase of groundwater soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations.

Detailed field studies combined with systematic qualitative and quantitative analyses of carbonate microfacies at high stratigraphic resolution show that this suite of cool water carbonate rocks is more variable than is suggested by its overall homogeneous macroscopic appearance. Long term changes in carbonate textures and fossil grain assemblages, together with pervasive rhythmic/cyclic patterns, suggest a strong influence from sea level on microfacies characteristics. Assessment of the results in light of regional facies patterns indicates that the cool water ""orthoceratite limestone"" behaved much like ""model"" siliciclastic sedimentary systems, in that carbonate texture varied with depositional depth as particle size of siliclastics does. Carbonate texture thus appears to reflect absolute depth well, whereas grain assemblages record high frequency cycles of changes in both sea level and substrate conditions. A relative sea level curve compiled from the collective data shows excellent agreement with previously published curves based on different proxies. The most important factor for the long term establishment and regional dominance of the ""orthoceratite limestone"" throughout much of the Early and Middle Ordovician appears to have been a limited terrigenous sediment input to the Baltoscandian paleobasin.

Our new data show that the presence of a significant proportion of secondary mineral (i.e. quartz) did not impact the mechanical strength of the limestone in both the brittle faulting and cataclastic flow regimes, but that the presence of water exerted a significant weakening effect. In contrast to previously published studies on deformation in limestones, inelastic compaction in Saint Maximin limestone was accompanied by abundant acoustic emission (AE) activity. The location of AE hypocenters during triaxial experiments revealed the presence of compaction localization. Two failure modes were identified in agreement with microstructural analysis and X ray computed tomography imaging: compactive shear bands developed at low confinement and complex diffuse compaction bands formed at higher confinement. Microstructural observations on deformed samples suggest that the recorded AE activity associated with inelastic compaction, unusual for a porous limestone, could have been due to microcracking at the quartz grain interfaces. Similar to published data on high porosity macroporous limestones, the crushing of calcite grains was the dominant micromechanism of inelastic compaction in Saint Maximin limestone. New P wave velocity data show that the effect of microcracking was dominant near the yield point and resulted in a decrease in P wave velocity, while porosity reduction resulted in a significant increase in P wave velocity beyond a few percent of plastic volumetric strain.

Local incidence of large vessel occlusion is critical in determining the development of thrombectomy service, but reliable data from Asian countries are lacking. Aims We performed a population based study to estimate the burden of large vessel occlusion and the service gap for thrombectomy in Hong Kong. Methods All acute ischemic stroke patients admitted in 2016 to the public healthcare system, which provided 90% of the emergency healthcare in the city, was identified from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority's central electronic database. The diagnosis of large vessel occlusion was retrospectively verified by two independent cerebrovascular specialists in a randomly sampled cohort based on clinical and neuroimaging data. The incidence of large vessel occlusion in the population was estimated through weighting the sample results and compared with the thrombectomy data in the same period. Results There were 6859 acute ischemic stroke patients treated in the public health system in 2016. Amongst the 300 patients randomly sampled according to diagnosis coding, 130 suffered from anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. This translated to 918 patients (95% CI 653 1180) and 13.3% of all ischemic stroke patients. The estimated incidence of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion was 12.5 per 100,000 persons per year (95% CI 11.7 13.4) Large vessel occlusion stroke patients were more commonly female than male (67.4% vs. 31.6% p 0.003) and were older than non large vessel occlusion stroke patients (mean of 80.5 years vs. 71.4 years, p 0.001) They also had higher 30 day mortality rate (31.1% vs. 4.6% p 0.001) and longer hospital stay (mean 38.6 vs. 21.1 days, p 0.003) than non large vessel occlusion stroke. In the same period, 83 thrombectomies for large vessel occlusion were performed, representing 9.1% of the estimated large vessel occlusion incidence.

Importance: The design of behavioral interventions in hospice and palliative care needs to acknowledge the unique challenges of these settings. Strategies to integrate ethical and cultural considerations, and to improve likelihood for translation into practice are needed. II. Objective(s) This presentation demonstrates how ethical considerations, cultural congruence, interdisciplinary collaboration and engagement of stakeholders can serve as keystones, namely foundational threads that inform the design, implementation and evaluation of a behavioral intervention in hospice and palliative care. III. Method(s) A model for behavioral intervention research was developed by our research team specifically for the hospice and palliative care settings. This model includes iterative steps that cover the spectrum of behavioral intervention research, starting from the definition and analysis of a problem, moving into the design of an intervention, pilot testing, refining and formally evaluating the intervention as well as disseminate findings and translating the intervention. IV. Results: Based on three federally funded clinical trials in various settings (including two clinical trials in home hospice and one in outpatient palliative care) we demonstrate how stakeholders can be engaged in all phases of the intervention development and testing. Similarly, strategies to address cultural congruence and methods to incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives are presented. Ethical considerations and challenges associated with the testing of behavioral interventions in these settings are discussed. V. Conclusion(s) In order to ensure that behavioral interventions can be tailored and effective and easily translatable into practice, extensive planning is required. A structured approach that integrates ethical and cultural considerations as well as interdisciplinary perspectives in all phases of the intervention design and testing, rather than an afterthought, can maximize the chances of a successful implementation and translation into practice. VI. Impact: The defined keystone considerations can inform and strengthen the design of behavioral interventions targeting patients, families, clinicians or other stakeholders in hospice and palliative care settings.

Where the implemented system measures the biomedical data utilizing a group of biomedical sensors, which are patient position sensor (PPS) galvanic skin response sensor (GSR) blood glucose sensor (BGS) and electromyography sensor (EMG) The System monitors the sleep position and skin conductance (indicator to patient\'s calm) of the patients in real time with alarm for each abnormal case in the base station (BS) and lobbies, and sends SMS alarm to doctor\'s phone, and it follows up patient\'s glucose rate and diagnosis the patient\'s electromyography status. Moreover, it sends the glucose data to doctor\'s phone and uploads it to the special web site by using the GSM and Internet technologies. In addition, it introduces a printed hard copy medical report. Moreover, the system stores the patient information and his health data in order to use it for any archiving process or statistical study. In the achievement system, three nodes are considered according to the facilities available but it stays monitor diagnosis for an open node number. The system is implemented practically and applied for some persons under supervision of the specialist physicians, and the results obtained are very satisfied and present a great service to human care.

Greater integration of healthcare may reduce these increases. We projected CYP healthcare activity out to 2040 and examined the potential impact of integrated care systems on projected activity. MethodsWe used routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) on emergency department (ED) attendances, emergency admissions and outpatient (OP) attendances for England by age group for 0 24 year olds from 2007 to 2017. Bayesian projections of future activity used projected population and ethnicity and future child poverty rates. Cause data were used to identify ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) FindingsED attendances, emergency admissions and OP attendances increased in all age groups from 2007 to 2017. ED and OP attendances increased 60 80% amongst children under 10 years. ACSC and neonatal causes drove the majority of increases in emergency admissions. Activity was projected to increase by 2040 by 50 145% for ED attendances, 20 125% for OP attendances and 4 58% for total admissions. Scenarios of increasing or decreasing child poverty resulted in small changes to forecast activity. Scenarios in which 50% of ACSC were seen outside hospital in integrated care reduced estimated activity in 2040 by 21.2 25.9% for admissions and 23.5 30.1% for ED attendances across poverty scenarios amongst infants. InterpretationThe rapid increases in CYP healthcare activity seen in the past decade may continue for the next decade given projected changes in population and child poverty, unless some of the drivers of increased activity are addressed. Contrary to these pessimistic scenarios, our findings suggest that development of integrated care for CYP at scale in England has the potential to dramatically reduce or even reverse these forecast increases FundingNil funding obtained.

Additional factors in child health include increased survival of premature neonates and those with congenital conditions and rising parental expectations of modern medicine. Previous studies have shown that ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) are responsible for much of the increase in CYP emergency activity in England and Scotland. Added value of this studyThis is the first study to use existing data to project possible future scenarios for CYP healthcare activity out to 2030 and 2040 in any country. Our future scenarios are based upon authoritative projections for population, ethnic diversity and child poverty in England and allow us to estimate the potential impact of integrated care scenarios in which ACSC are treated outside hospital. We show that future projected CYP activity is very high if mitigations such as integrated care are not instituted in England. Implications of all the available evidenceHealthcare activity has grown dramatically over the last decade in CYP, largely due to ACSC and the consequences of premature delivery. Projections to 2040 suggest that similar increases are likely over the next 2 decades without action to reduce child poverty and implementation of integrated care at scale in the NHS.', 'corpus_id': 231933549, 'venue': 'medRxiv', 'year': 2021.0, 'author_names': ['Dougal S Hargreaves', 'Alison Firth', 'Steven Turner', 'Russell M Viner'], 'n_citations': 0, 'n_key_citations': 0, 'score': 0}, {'doc_id': '74286825', 'title': 'Enhancement of hospital libraries and information services through an e support system for lifelong learning quality methodologies and tools', 'abstract': 'Quality is indeed a multifaceted concept entailing multiple consequences for the overall management of healthcare services.

Vascular, ocular, central nervous system and gastrointestinal lesions occur less frequently, but are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [1, 2] The aetiology of BS remains unclear and several pathogenic pathways are likely to be involved [3 6] BS can affect males and females in equal proportions, but it seems to present with a more severe course in males [1, 7] Since no laboratory or imaging findings are specific for BS, the diagnosis is usually based on clinical features only. However, the situation is far more complicated, since there is a strong variability among different geographical locations both in the prevalence and expression of the disease. Classically, BS has been referred to the Silk Route, because the Middle East and the Far East Asia are considered endemic for this condition [8] Lately, severe epidemiologic studies have outlined that the increasing awareness of the condition is changing the view. Indeed, BS was considered rare among black individuals, but a study from Dakar, Senegal has proposed a yearly incidence of 3.84 per 100,000 people [9] Moreover, also human migration is playing a role as outlined by a survey based study done in Paris among immigrants: the incidence rate of BS was not different than that in the countries of origin [10] The studies are different and sometimes difficult to compare, but we can assume that gastrointestinal manifestations are more frequent in the Far East Asia, whereas vascular lesions, such as arterial aneurysms or inflammatory thromboses are more frequent in the Middle East Asia [11] Moreover, a milder course of the disease has been reported in non endemic areas [7] These geographical differences in clinical features account for the difficulties in the classification of BS. The International Study Group (ISG) for Behcet's Disease criteria [12] and the International Classification for Behcet's Disease (ICBD) criteria [13] do not consider enough geographic variability, leading to some difficulties in differentiating some clinical features of BS from other autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (e.g. the gastrointestinal involvement in BS and Crohn's disease) [7] Sota et al. in this issue of Internal and Emergency Medicine analyse the current situation of BS in Italy [14] They report on a retrospective hospital based analysis of 396 cases referred to three referral centers in Central and Southern Italy. This is the largest Italian cohort ever described. Patients were admitted between January 2015 and January 2017, and their medical charts were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnosis of BS was made according to ISG or ICBD. All patients were Caucasian, predominantly of Italian ancestry. The majority of patients were female (female/male ratio of 1.22/1) and 81% were younger than 40 years at the disease onset. The authors recorded as most frequent manifestations at onset oral and genital ulcers (91% and 21.5% respectively) skin manifestations (in particular psudofollicolitis, pustular lesions and erythema nodosum) and the ocular involvement presenting mostly as a bilateral panuveitis. With regard to clinical features, hospital based studies have the tendency to collect mostly complicated cases presenting with more severe involvements, whereas population based studies include milder forms of the disease. This could explain the high prevalence of severe ocular involvement. Another interesting issue is the tendency of different clinical features to cluster together, forming different clinical subsets, such as the acne arthritis enthesitis subset or the vascular subset [15 18] This tendency could suggest that multiple pathogenic pathways contribute to the development of BS [6] In this regard, the authors have also performed a factor analysis, to detect some clinical associations. They described two independent factors: the association of bipolar aphtosis with erythema nodosum and pseudofollicolitis, and uveitis as a distinct feature.

Due to its effectiveness in reaching consumers despite the overload of information present on media channels nowadays. Dedicated influencer agencies have risen up, in response to the increasing use of influencer marketing. These agencies provide brands with the necessary tools and expertise for developing an influencer led social media campaign. This seems highly valuable as many brands are still unaware of influencer marketing. Since the early days of influencer marketing, companies have only focused on collaborating with large scale macro influencers. However, a relatively new trend has emerged of the so called 'micro influencers' These micro influencers might require new approaches to influencer marketing processes. The aim of this study is to identify the development and creation of a micro influencer led social media campaign, and the role of influencer agencies throughout this process. The process will be explained through the lens of influencer marketing agencies, as an important intermediary between brands and influencers. To answer this question a total number of eleven in depth expert interviews with influencer agency representatives have been conducted, following a data analysis through thematic coding. This study shows that the role of influencer agencies could not be completely generalized, as there is a discrepancy between automated and non automated influencer agencies. However, overall the role of the influencer agency has shown to consist of multiple elements. The influencer agency educates its clients on influencer marketing and micro influencers and guides them through the development process of a social media campaign. On top of that, the influencer agency ensures an influencer/brand fit for the campaign through the execution of multiple screening processes as well as protecting the micro influencer's creative freedom. Ultimately, this will provide the client with the most effective micro influencer led social media campaign. This study has also shown that the development process of a social media campaign in cooperation with a micro influencer as opposed to the macro influencer is, for the most part, similar to each other. However, there are some essential elements which create a distinction between the two types of influencers. The micro influencers prove to be effective in reaching a small and niche community.

In respect of this development, this study focuse on the ways micro influencers apply human branding techniques in order to construct and carve out distinct identities in an increasing mature Influencer Marketing market. One of the most striking observations is a two structural identity constructing process, reaching over three phases. Personal branding starts, first of all, at a basic level of identity construction and transitions gradually into a consecutive, iterative process at later stages. Micro influencers have to orchestrate and sustain multiple social interactions with varying proximities simultaneously. Understanding the decisive role of communication and engagement is crucial to succeed since micro influencer's person brand identity is intensely interwoven with follower's identity construction and, in a few cases, partnered with other micro influencers. By running an Instagram account, most of interviewees recognized an acute shortage of one resource: time. To sustain the intensity of their characteristic, one on one engagement, the proactive solution of delegation emerged as a deterrent, however likely necessary approach in order to achieve growth. Deduced from findings, posting once a day seemed to be the best communication strategy to exercise influence in an already mediasaturated, information rich environment and move towards a full time profession post by post. While considering data privacy carefully, it is impressive how micro influencers have mastered controlling conversations and sensitive information across their media network. In theory, micro influencers are supposed to have internalized the concept of authenticity. In reality, micro influencers are confronted with the challenge of maintaining consistency and therewith authenticity and the intention to cultivate a larger audience. Even though, microinfluencers seemed to merge two contradictory aspects, authenticity and commodification, effortlessly into one another, an internally and externally imposed pressure can be overwhelming. By expanding their visual storytelling with (live) videos, their authenticity and thus legitimacy as micro influencers can be reconstructed. Overall, micro influencers' efforts in visual storytelling can be interpreted as tacit labor as their daily contributions are systematic and determined even if they seem effortless for outsiders. By embarking in depth interviews with 20 participants, this study accentuates the way in which the process of micro celebrification on Instagram is currently executed.

Less is known, however, about the factors children in elementary schools perceive to be important in promoting enjoyment, and how the current PE delivery framework in UK primary schools (combining specialist external coaches and generalist teachers) impacts on children's motivational experiences. According to self determination theory (SDT) enjoyment of activities is an intrinsic motivator for sustained engagement. Understanding children's perceptions of PE is therefore critical if PE instructors are to increase enjoyment and the promotion of PA within and beyond PE. Purpose: To investigate children's perceptions of factors that influence PE enjoyment, and interpret findings in the context of SDT and the promotion of autonomous motivation. Participants: Primary school pupils recruited from a cluster of four schools within a socio economically deprived area of a large city in the North West of England.

Findings were interpreted in relation to SDT, and recommendations are given to help instructors and schools create a PE environment that enhances children's enjoyment of PE. Conclusions: PE instructors and peers are important in creating an environment that supports children's psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, which influence PE enjoyment. To consistently provide children with enjoyable PE lessons, primary schools are advised to support the ongoing development of generalist teachers and facilitate better working relationships between generalist teachers and specialist coaches.

Several contextual factors can influence the recovery process. These factors, internal and external, exist interactively in the lived experiences of the survivors. The limited availability of rehabilitation centres that are located in urban centres meant that recovery predominately occurred outside of the biomedical health and instead relied upon the resources available to individuals and their families. Methods: A qualitative approach with data from in depth interviews and observations were used to identify contextual factors that shaped recovery following stroke in a community. Twenty seven individuals with stroke were drawn from a health and demographic surveillance system in Malaysia. Results: Hope and optimism, coping strategies, motivation and support from family and friends, and the use of alternative and complementary medicine shaped the process of recovery within a context where infrastructure is extremely limited. Conclusion: The identification of factors that facilitate the recovery process provides a background in which health care providers can utilise to improve their understanding of the stroke experience. Such understanding could be instrumental in aiding health professionals to offer the most effective help to their clients.

Yet at the same time they claim that it can approach the speed of light without any upper limit on how close it could get to that special speed. As we will see, this leads to some absurd predictions. If we assert that a material system cannot reach the speed of light, an important question is then, ""How close can it get to the speed of light?""

199	The SAT phase transition	7739d39ee3b36132aeacc86c6167928c	"[{'doc_id': '1373490', 'title': 'The SAT Phase Transition', 'abstract': 'We describe a detailed experimental investigation of the phase transition for several different classes of randomly generated satisfiability problems. We observe a remarkable consistency of fea tures in the phase transition despite the presence in some of the problem classes of clauses of mixed lengths. For instance, each of the problem classes considered has a sharp transition from satisfiable to unsatisfiable problems at a critical value. In addition, there is a com mon easy hard easy pattern in the median difficulty of the problems, with the hardest problems being associated with the phase transition. However, the difficulty of problems of mixed clause lengths is much more variable than that of fixed clause length. Indeed, whilst the me dian difficulty of random problems of mixed clause lengths can be orders of magnitude easier than that of equivalently sized problems of fixed clause length, the hardest problems of mixed clause lengths can be orders of magnitude harder than the hardest equivalently sized problems of fixed clause length. Such very hard random problems may be of considerable practical and theoretical use in analysing algorithm performance.', 'corpus_id': 1373490, 'venue': 'ECAI', 'year': 1994.0, 'author_names': ['Ian P Gent', 'Toby Walsh'], 'n_citations': 103, 'n_key_citations': 10, 'score': 1}, {'doc_id': '934891', 'title': 'The SAT phase transition', 'abstract': 'Phase transition is an important feature of SAT problem.

However, this criterion is useless in practice, because real world or industrial instances have some properties not shown in random formulas. In the last years, several models of realistic random formulas have been proposed. Here we discuss about the phase transition in these models, and about the size of unsatisfiability proofs. We observe that in these models, like in real world formulas, there is not a sharp phase transition, the transition occurs for smaller values of r, and the proofs on unsatisfiable formulas are smaller than in the classical random model.
