We here analysed the prognostic significance of MSI and mutations of the Beta2-Microglobulin (B2M) gene, which occur in about 30% of MSI-H colon cancer, in the cohort of the prospective FOGT-4 (Forschungsruppe Onkologie Gastrointestinale Tumoren, FOGT) trial.Methods:Microsatellite instability status was determined using standard protocols (NCI/ICG-HNPCC panel and CAT25) in 223 colon cancer lesions. Beta2-Microglobulin mutation status was evaluated by exon-wise sequencing in all MSI-H lesions.Results:Patients with MSI-H (n=34) colon cancer presented with a significantly lower risk of relapse after 12 months of follow-up compared with MSS (n=189) colon cancer patients (5 year time to relapse: MSI-H 0.82 vs MSS 0.66, P=0.03). No significant difference in overall survival was detected. Beta2-Microglobulin mutations were identified in 10 (29.4%) out of 34 MSI-H colon cancers and were associated with a complete absence of disease relapse or tumour-related death events (P=0.09).Conclusion:The risk of late disease relapse was significantly lower in patients with MSI-H compared with MSS colon cancer. Moreover, B2M mutations may contribute to the favourable outcome of MSI-H colon cancer patients and should therefore be evaluated as a potential prognostic marker in future clinical trials.

2	21971950	1966499654	21971950	The role of the thalamic reticular neurons in alpha- and gamma-oscillations in neocortex: a mechanism for selective perception and stimulus binding.	"The long-term objective is to understand how large masses of neurons in the brain process information during various learning and memory paradigms. Both time- and space-dependent processes have been identified in animals through computer-based analytic quantifications of event-related extracellular potentials. New nonlinear analyses have been introduced that presume that the fine-grain variation in the signal is determined and patterned in phase-space. Some neurons in the primary visual cortex manifest gamma-band oscillations. These cells show both a nonspecific phase-alignment (response synchrony) and a specific tuning (orientation tuning) when stimuli are presented to their receptive fields. This dual regulation of the sensory cells is proposed to underlie stimulus binding, a theoretical mechanism for ""object"" perception. Nonlinear analytic results from gamma-activities in a simple model neuropil (olfactory bulb) suggest that neuroplasticity may arise through self-organization, a process in which a nonlinear change in the dynamics of the oscillatory field potentials is the hallmark. This self-organization may follow simple dynamical laws in which global cooperativity among the neurons is transiently brought about that, over trials, results in enduring changes in the nonlinear dynamics of some neurons. In conclusion, the sculpturing of the synaptic throughput in the sensory cortex (stimulus binding) may be associated with the irregular phases of the gamma-activities and may result from both specific and nonspecific systems operating together in a nonlinear self-organizing manner."

Sunitinib monotherapy in pretreated patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) was investigated. Preplanned analyses of tumour biomarkers on treatment outcome were performed.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients received sunitinib 50mg/day for 4 weeks with 2 weeks rest until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end-points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.


RESULTS
Fifty-two patients were enrolled and treated (safety population, SP). In the intention to treat population (n=51); the ORR was 3.9%, median PFS was 1.28 months [95% CI, 1.18-1.90], median OS was 5.81 months [95% CI, 3.48-12.32], the estimated one-year survival rate was 23.7% [95%CI: 12.8-36.5]. In subgroup analyses, tumour VEGF-C expression compared with no expression was associated with significantly shorter median PFS (1.23 versus 2.86 months, logrank p=0.0119) but there was no difference in tumour control rate (p=0.142). In the SP, serious adverse events occurred in 26 patients, leading to 13 deaths, all sunitinib unrelated. Thirty-eight patients died from progressive disease, nine died <60 days after treatment start.


CONCLUSION
Sunitinib monotherapy was associated with limited tumour response and good/moderate tolerability in this setting."	Antineoplastic Agents	therapeutic use

Traditionally, the study of medicine has focused on individual diseases. In reality, however, diseases tend to co-occur in individual patients, a concept known as multimorbidity. Multimorbidity most often is seen in geriatric practice. Empirical data on patients with multiple chronic disorders and clinical care guidelines based on single conditions are insufficient to inform medical care of patients with >1 medical condition.


METHODS
This article reviews concepts of multimorbidity in the published literature in the context of substance use disorders, other psychiatric disorders, and associated social and environmental problems in other populations, including public sector service populations.


RESULTS
Besides historically recognized co-occurrence of 3 dimensions of illness, including multiple medical illnesses, psychiatric disorders, and substance use disorders in varying combinations with one another, a fourth dimension of multimorbidity that includes associated social and environmental conditions fits within this construction.


CONCLUSIONS
Additional steps are needed to address more effectively the needs of patients with substance use and other psychiatric disorders in the public sector psychiatric systems of care. These efforts will need to address the systems theory approach to multimorbidity that entails the socioeconomic and environmental aspects of their conditions."	Mental Disorders	epidemiology

One of the body's natural defense mechanisms against tumor cells is lysis of the invading cell by cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Five human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were found to have different sensitivities to killing by peripheral blood monocytes in a 51Cr release assay. This killing was demonstrated to be due to NK cell lysis. Electrical recording measurements of the membrane potentials of these five cell lines showed different values for each line, all below values reported for normal hepatocytes. Correlation between mean cell membrane potential, and sensitivity to NK lysis, revealed an inverse relationship. In this study we demonstrate that the lower the mean membrane potential of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, the more sensitive it is to NK cell cytolysis. Cell surface positive potential did not correlate with NK cytolysis and only a weak correlation was found between cell membrane negative potential and cell surface positive potential between cell lines.

This study was undertaken to clarify the relation between microvessel count and lymph node metastasis in submucosal colorectal cancer. METHODS: Microvessel count was estimated in 254 invasive tumors that had been resected from patients with submucosal colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against CD34 was performed on archival specimens, and microvessel counts were estimated based on the average count of three fields (original magnification, ×400) in the most vascular area at the site of deepest submucosal penetration. RESULTS: Microvessel count ranged from 10 to 98, with a median of 40. Lesions with high microvessel counts (≥40) had a significantly higher incidence of lymph node metastasis than those with low microvessel counts (<40; 21.8 percentvs. 6.2 percent). None of the 79 lesions with low microvessel counts and submucosal invasion up to a depth of 1,500µm had metastasized to the lymph nodes. In multivariate analysis, microvessel count was an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis in submucosal colorectal cancer (P=0.0026). CONCLUSION: Microvessel count at the site of deepest submucosal penetration can be one of the most useful predictors for lymph node metastasis. Analysis that combines microvessel count and depth of submucosal invasion may predict the occurrence of lesions without lymph node metastasis.	Adenocarcinoma	blood supply

The effect of escitalopram on ethanol withdrawal syndrome (EWS) and involvement of nitric oxide system in rats was investigated. Male Wistar rats divided into five experimental groups of eight animals each: (a) control group; (b) EWS (saline) group; (c) escitalopram 2.5 mg group; (d) escitalopram 5mg group and (e) escitalopram 10 mg group. Ethanol dependence was induced in rats by ethanol-containing liquid diet and ethanol withdrawal was precipitated by replacing ethanol free diet. Ethanol receiving rats in individual groups were decapitated on 21st day of ethanol ingestion and at sixth hour of ethanol withdrawal. Brains were removed and dissected. Five regions of the brain were dissected: the frontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Immunohistochemical NOS staining was performed. The NOS staining intensity in cortex and hypothalamus regions were significantly lower in EWS group than control group. During EWS period, in rats given 2.5 and 10 mg/kg escitalopram, the staining intensity in cortex, striatum and hippocampus were found to be 11.492, 8.519 and 11.234, respectively, and was statistically different than the control group. The hippocampal NOS staining intensity was found to be significantly decreased with 2.5 mg/kg escitalopram, whereas the cortex, striatum and hippocampal staining intensity were increased significantly with 5 mg/kg. In 10 mg/kg escitalopram group, staining properties were not different than those of the control group. Our results suggest that NOS decreases during ethanol withdrawal in cortex and hypothalamus of rat brain and treatment with escitalopram reverses the enzyme density in cortex but not hypothalamus.

Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) performed at the time of the histologic diagnosis were normal. These findings strongly supported the diagnosis of primary cutaneous Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient received local radiation therapy (2 Gy daily for 5 days a week, for a total of 40 Gy) and had complete regression of the skin lesions with residual hyperpigmentation. During 7 years of follow-up laboratory tests, PET and CT scans and control histology ( performed in the same radio-treated skin area 6 months after radiotherapy) were all in the normal range, and no evidence of systemic disease was shown. During the follow-up period, CT scans were repeated four times, every 18 to 20 months. The patient has completely recovered and is currently in good health. HD is a lymphoma of unknown etiology that most often presents as painless swelling of the superficial lymph nodes. It is usually a systemic disease. Skin involvement with painless reddish papules and nodules that become ulcerated may be a late manifestation of Hodgkin lymphoma and generally reflects direct extension from underlying nodal disease. Rarely, retrograde lymphatic spread or hematogenous dissemination may occur. Skin involvement with nonspecific cutaneous findings may represent a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by pruritus, urticaria, erythroderma, eczematoid, and psoriasiform eruptions. In this scenario, neoplastic cells are not detected histologically. Primary cutaneous HD in the absence of systemic involvement is rare. Sioutos et al described five cases of primary cutaneous HD without evidence of systemic disease. Interestingly, in three of these cases, HD remained restricted to the skin after 20 years of follow-up, whereas in two of the cases, Hodgkin lymphoma was discovered in the lymph nodes after 2 months and 6 years, respectively. Guitart et al reported an elderly patient with a single cutaneous nodule histologically classified as HD in whom systemic disease was discovered 1 year later. The histologic diagnosis of primary cutaneous HD is difficult, although detection of neoplastic ReedeSternberg cells with mirror nuclei is helpful. Cerroni et al summarized the immunohistochemical features of cutaneous HD in seven patients with nodal HD and specific cutaneous lesions and concluded that immunohistochemical analysis is helpful for diagnosis. The neoplastic cells are positive for activation antigens CD30 and CD15 and negative for CD45. These findings strongly support the diagnosis of HD and exclude lymphomatoid papulosis, which sometimes may simulate HD histologically. Our case highlights the possibility that Hodgkin lymphoma, which is generally a systemic disease that in its late stage can involve the skin, may also occur as primary skin tumor. Primary cutaneous HD may be diagnosed when the condition is restricted to the skin without evidence of extracutaneous disease at the time of diagnosis and within the first 6 months after diagnosis. Careful clinical follow-up is always indicated to exclude the evolution of primary cutaneous HD to systemic lymphoma.	Anti-Bacterial Agents	administration & dosage

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyses the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs. TPMT activity in the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats is approximately twice that present in the kidneys of female S-D rats, and this difference is testosterone-dependent. Renal TPMT activities in these animals also increase dramatically during growth and development. 2. Our studies were conducted to determine whether variations in TMPT activity in the S-D rat kidney were due to differences in the quantity of TPMT protein. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to partially purified rat kidney TPMT were used to develop an immunoprecipitation assay for immunoreactive TPMT protein. 3. Gender-related differences in renal TPMT activities in S-D rats were due to a lower content of immunoreactive TPMT protein in kidneys of female animals. TPMT enzyme activities and immunoreactive protein levels were also directly correlated in renal preparations from castrated and sham-operated male rats, from testosterone-treated castrated and sham-operated male rats, and from testosterone-treated and control female rats. 4. There was also a significant positive correlation between TPMT enzymic activities and immunoreactive TPMT protein levels in renal tissue from different aged male S-D rats (rs = 0.955, n = 15, P less than 0.001.) 5. These results demonstrate that changes in S-D kidney TPMT activity during growth and development, in the two sexes and in response to testosterone, were due to variations in the quantity of immunoreactive TPMT protein.

In many factors affecting the biologic behavior of malignant cells, alterations in the carbohydrate composition of cell membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids are considered to underlie the changes in cell adhesion that accompany malignant transformation and the development of invasive and metastatic properties. We investigated the alterations of the cell surface glycoproteins structure of carcinoma of the esophagus cells by HPA staining. The rate of patients with positive HPA staining increases with progression of depth of carcinoma invasion and venous invasion, and the survival in patients with positive HPA was poorer than in those with negative HPA. HPA-positive cells of carcinoma of the esophagus represent high malignant potentials. The HPA staining method is available to predict the prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus.

The carbocyclic analogues of (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) and (E)-5-(2-iodovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (IVDU), in which the sugar moiety is replaced by a cyclopentane ring and which have been designated as C-BVDU and C-IVDU, respectively, are, like their parent compounds BVDU and IVDU, potent and selective inhibitors of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and, to a lesser extent, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) replication. We have now synthesized the radiolabeled C-IVDU analogue, C-[125I]IVDU, and determined its metabolism by HSV-infected and mock-infected Vero cells. C-[125I]IVDU was effectively phosphorylated by HSV-1-infected cells and, to a lesser extent, HSV-2-infected cells. C-[125I]IVDU was not phosphorylated to an appreciable extent by either mock-infected cells or cells that had been infected with a thymidine kinase-deficient mutant of HSV-1. Furthermore, C-[125I]IVDU was incorporated into both viral and cellular DNA of HSV-1-infected Vero cells. This finding represents the first demonstration of the incorporation of a cyclopentylpyrimidine into DNA.	DNA	biosynthesis

Ascorbic acid (AsA) concentrations in plasma exert a modulating effect on the activity of liver enzymes. Since UDP-glucuronyl transferase is a liver enzyme, which is responsible for bilirubin glucuronidation, the effect of varied amounts of AsA on this enzyme activity was studied. Sixty male guinea-pigs were randomly allocated to the following six groups: controls, scorbutic and groups given 2, 5, 10 or 20 mg of ascorbic acid, respectively. All the animals with the vitamin C deficient diet presented clinical signs of scurvy at the end of the experimental period, and had lost both body and liver weight compared to all other groups. Scorbutic animals had very low levels of AsA in the liver compared with controls (0.20 +/- 0.10 and 1.65 +/- 0.45 mg/g liver, respectively) (p less than 0.001). Liver AsA levels increased as the AsA dose increased. The UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity was lower in scorbutic animals than in controls (6.20 +/- 1.95 and 23.85 +/- 4.20 mg bilirubin/g protein/h, respectively) (p less than 0.001). The other groups C, D, E and F also had higher mean levels of UDP-GT activity than the scorbutic group B. Finally, no correlation was found between UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity and ascorbic acid intake.	Liver	enzymology

To assess the clinical features, additional abnormalities, and renal consequences of children with horseshoe kidney (HSK).


METHODS
The medical records of 41 children with HSK followed in our pediatric nephrology clinic between the years of 2004 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed.


RESULTS
There were 22 girls (53.6%) and 19 boys (46.4%) aged 60 (2-192) months. The median follow-up time was 48 (12-120) months. HSK was incidentally found in 12 patients (29.3%), and 5 patients (12.2%) were prenatally diagnosed. Urinary tract abnormalities including vesicoureteral reflux (n = 8), ureteropelvic junction obstruction (n = 7), and duplex system (n = 3) were identified in 18 patients (43.9%). Eight children (19.5%) had bladder dysfunction, and 9 patients (21.9%) had additional systemic abnormalities. Urinary tract infection had been detected in 17 patients (41.4%). Seven patients (17%) required surgical intervention including pyeloplasty (n = 3), ureteroneocystostomy (n = 3), and upper pole heminephrectomy (n = 1). Renal scarring (RS) occurred in 10 patients (24.4%). Six patients (14.6%) developed proteinuria and 4 (9.8%) complicated with hypertension. Three patients (7.3%) progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hypertension, and RS are independently associated with CKD.


CONCLUSION
Children with HSK might be examined for additional urologic and nonurologic abnormalities. Patients might be closely followed up for the increased risk of urinary tract infection and RS. Proteinuria, hypertension, and presence of RS seem to be the major determinants for progression to CKD in children with HSK."	Kidney	abnormalities

Differential ontogeny of neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2 and neurokinin-3 binding sites in rat cerebral cortex	The autoradiographic distribution of the 3 neurokinin (NK) receptor sub-types, NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3, was compared in rat cerebral cortex during post-natal development using [125I]Bolton-Hunter-substance P, (2-[125I]iodohistidyl1)neurokinin A and [125I]Bolton-Hunter-eledoisin as respective radioligands. Throughout brain development, NK-1 receptor sites are present in low densities with some enrichment seen in lamina III while NK-3 binding sites are concentrated in layers IV and V. However, it appears that NK-2 receptors are mostly expressed in lamina VI and only during the first two postnatal weeks. These results demonstrate further the existence and differential ontogeny of 3 classes of NK receptors in rat brain cortex.	Aging	metabolism

Chronic pain in individuals with HIV is a common, impairing condition. Behavioral interventions for chronic pain specifically tailored to this population have yet to be developed. We assert that understanding self-management strategies already used by persons living with these conditions is an essential first step, and is the objective of this investigation.


DESIGN
We conducted a thematic analysis of qualitative data from 25 in-depth interviews with individuals with HIV and chronic pain.


RESULTS
The primary pain self-management strategies articulated by participants were: physical activity; cognitive and spiritual strategies; spending time with family and friends and social support; avoidance of physical/social activity; medication-centric pain management; and substance use.


CONCLUSIONS
Some of these strategies may be viewed as beneficial and overlap with known HIV self-management strategies (cognitive strategies), whereas others may have negative health consequences (substance use). Interventions that incorporate healthy self-management strategies may be particularly effective in improving both HIV and pain outcomes."	HIV Infections	complications
20	34839349	2028306408	34839349	Characterization and phenotypic variation with passage number of cultured human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells.	Despite numerous endometrial cancer cell lines, little is know about the progression and transition of primary cultured endometrial tumours. Herein, a stage I grade III endometrial adenocarcinoma was maintained in primary culture and the phenotypic and protein expression changes were observed in relation to passage number. At early passage numbers, cultured human endometrial cancer (CHEC) cells displayed classic epithelial cell morphology, growing in groups in a glandular structure and staining positive for cytokeratin. However, with increasing passage number, CHEC cells changed in morphology to display a stromal phenotype which was accompanied by a significant reduction in cytokeratin and increases in alpha-actin and vimentin expression. Simultaneous culture of stromal cells isolated from the original tumour failed to show the same morphological characteristics or protein expression patterns. We further characterised CHEC cells through a screening of cancer related proteins, among others, caveolin-1 and Tissue factor in comparison with established cancer cell lines and corresponding non-cancerous cells. This report demonstrates that endometrial adenocarcinoma cells in culture can undergo phenotypic and protein expression changes reminiscent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This work suggests that primary tumours and cell lines displaying stromal morphologies may have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition from an adenocarcinoma origin.	Adenocarcinoma	pathology

Sung Bae Park, Department of Internal Medicine, Keimyung University School of Medicine, 194 Dong San Dong, Taegu 700-310 (Korea) Dear Sir, Renal biopsy has become an integral part in the diagnosis, management and prognosis of renal diseases. Percutaneous renal biopsy has been a relatively safe procedure. Rarely, severe hemorrhage after percutaneous renal biopsy is a risk to the patient because of high morbidity and mortality. The risk of surgery for nephrectomy or to repair a laceration due to biopsy is approximately 1/500 to 1/1,000 [1]. Recent technological improvements in intervention radiology devices have made superselective catheterization and embolization possible [2]. Superselective embolization with coaxial catheter techniques is an effective method of treating hemorrhage after renal biopsy. We present a case of active bleeding following percutaneous renal biopsy, who was treated successfully with super-selective embolization of a branch of the intrarenal artery. A 14-year-old boy had a percutaneous renal needle biopsy performed as part of a study for glomerulonephritis. The biopsy was carried out by our usual technique with the patient in the prone position and a pillow under the abdomen. The ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy was performed using a Franklin-modified Vim-Silverman needle. The biopsy specimen was obtained easily after only one attempt. Thirty minutes after biopsy the patient experienced severe left flank pain with rapid pulse rates (124 min). An hour later, blood pressure dropped to around 90/50 mm Hg, and the patient became lethargic and extremely ill.

Changes in the distribution of the magnetic resonance (MR)-observable brain metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total choline (Cho), and total creatine (Cre), following mild-to-moderate closed-head traumatic brain injury (mTBI) were evaluated using volumetric proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Studies were carried out during the subacute time period following injury, and associations of metabolite indices with neuropsychological test (NPT) results were evaluated. Twenty-nine subjects with mTBI and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 10-15 were included. Differences in individual metabolite and metabolite ratio distributions relative to those of age-matched control subjects were evaluated, as well as analyses by hemispheric lobes and tissue types. Primary findings included a widespread decrease of NAA and NAA/Cre, and increases of Cho and Cho/NAA, within all lobes of the TBI subject group, and with the largest differences seen in white matter. Examination of the association between all of the metabolite measures and the NPT scores found the strongest negative correlations to occur in the frontal lobe and for Cho/NAA. No significant correlations were found between any of the MRSI or NPT measures and the GCS. These results demonstrate that significant and widespread alterations of brain metabolites occur as a result of mild-to-moderate TBI, and that these measures correlate with measures of cognitive performance.

Ten different types of psychotherapy were investigated by looking at the role of the sex or gender of therapists and patients with regard to treatment outcome by including several nonspecific therapeutic factors. Method: Ten different types of psychotherapy, 237 patients, and 68 therapists were included in the study. A subsample of 116 cases was analyzed with regard to therapists' technical interventions. Results: Sex and gender issues of both therapists and patients did not play a crucial role in any type of psychotherapy investigated. Gender issues appeared to play an indirect role. Female therapists intervene more empathically, whereas male therapists tend to use more confrontational techniques. Conclusions: Since the results show that therapists differ substantially with regard to their intervention techniques due to their sex, they should become more conscious of their interventions by considering patients' severity of psychological problems and patients' level of psychological functioning so as to not over or underchallenge them.

In the present study, primary dopaminergic cultures from mouse mesencephala were treated with citicoline to investigate its neuroprotective potential on the survival of dopaminergic neurons exposed to MPP+ and glutamate. Treatment with citicoline alone significantly increased the survival of dopaminergic neurons compared to controls. MPP+ or glutamate decreased the total number of dopaminergic neurons whereas citicoline afforded significant protection against either toxicity. Moreover, citicoline significantly decreased propidium iodide uptake by cultured cells. The study concludes that citicoline exerts stimulant and neuroprotective actions on cultured dopaminergic neurons.	Neurons	drug effects

We used consensual qualitative research methods to analyze narratives on this topic by 12 Mexican-descent caregivers (160 pages of transcripts). The caregivers predominantly represented parent (mother) caregivers with levels of psychological distress and burden that were similar to those of larger samples of Mexican-descent caregivers. They represented equally high and low Expressed Emotion. We found that (a) caregivers’ high knowledge (awareness) of medication usage was either tied to a hands-on monitoring approach or inferred by either the absence or the presence of their relatives’ symptoms, (b) caregivers struggled with reconciling the symptom stabilization benefits of medication with the medications’ side effects and limitations, and (c) most caregivers received little to no assistance from other available family members. Theory development and possible interventions involving family-assisted support of psychiatric medication usage should assess and possibly address caregivers’ struggles with medications’ side effects and low levels of support from available family.

26	27618680	2091805219	27618680	A capillary monolithic trypsin reactor for efficient protein digestion in online and offline coupling to ESI and MALDI mass spectrometry.	We describe the preparation of a capillary trypsin immobilized monolithic enzyme reactor (IMER) for a rapid and efficient digestion of proteins down to the femtomole level. Trypsin was immobilized on a poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol dimethycrylate) monolith using the glutaraldehyde technique. Digestion efficiencies of the IMER were evaluated using model proteins and protein mixtures as well as chemically cross-linked lysozyme regarding the addition of denaturants and increasing digestion temperature. The trypsin IMER described herein is applicable for the digestion of protein mixtures. Even at a 1000-fold molar excess of one protein, low-abundance proteins are readily identified, in combination with MS/MS analysis. An online setup of the IMER with reversed phase nano-HPLC separation and nano-ESI-MS/MS analysis was established. The great potential of the trypsin IMER for proteomics applications comprise short digestion times in the range of seconds to minutes, in addition to improved digestion efficiencies, compared to in-solution digestion.

Methods: In this prospective study all patients on the active transplant list and all patients with functioning renal transplants at our hospital were tested for HCV antibody (ELISA-2) over a 30-month period. HCV infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in most patients. All HCV-positive patients were asked to undergo liver biopsy without regard to serum transaminase levels. Patients were interviewed, examined, and had detailed chart review. By protocol, liver histology was evaluated according to stage and inflammatory activity in a blinded fashion. Results: There were 129 HCV-antibody–positive patients, of 795 tested. Sixty-seven agreed to liver biopsy. Of these, 22 patients had never been transplanted and 45 had received transplants. Mean transplant duration before biopsy was 41.2 months (range, 1–204 months). Transplant patients had significantly longer duration of ESRD and estimated duration of HCV infection than patients not transplanted. Dialysis patients had significantly more portal inflammatory activity and lymphoid follicles on biopsy whereas transplant patients had more piecemeal necrosis and steatosis. However, the total histological activity score and stage were similar between groups. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between transplant and steatosis. But independent variables including transplant duration, HCV infection duration, and ESRD duration were not correlated with histological findings. Conclusion: Renal transplantation may not be associated with an increased risk of progressive liver disease in HCV-positive patients, compared with ESRD patients receiving chronic dialysis. Long-term studies with serial liver biopsies are needed to resolve this issue.	Liver	pathology

Recently, electroencephalography- (EEG-) based physiological and brain activities for fatigue detection have been increasingly investigated. However, how to find an effective method or model to timely and efficiently detect the mental states of drivers still remains a challenge. In this paper, we combine common spatial pattern (CSP) and propose a light-weighted classifier, LightFD, which is based on gradient boosting framework for EEG mental states identification. The comparable results with traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), show that the proposed model could achieve better classification performance, as well as the decision efficiency. Furthermore, we also test and validate that LightFD has better transfer learning performance in EEG classification of driver mental states. In summary, our proposed LightFD classifier has better performance in real-time EEG mental state prediction, and it is expected to have broad application prospects in practical brain-computer interaction (BCI).

Based on 13C flux analysis of Escherichia coli mutants, we elucidated the relevance of global transcriptional regulation by ArcA, ArcB, Cra, CreB, CreC, Crp, Cya, Fnr, Hns, Mlc, OmpR, and UspA on aerobic glucose catabolism in glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a growth rate of 0.1 h−1. The by far most relevant control mechanism was cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression as the inducer of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate cycle and thus low tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes. While all other mutants and the reference E. coli strain exhibited high glyoxylate shunt and PEP carboxykinase fluxes, and thus high PEP-glyoxylate cycle flux, this cycle was essentially abolished in both the Crp and Cya mutants, which lack the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein complex. Most other mutations were phenotypically silent, and only the Cra and Hns mutants exhibited slightly altered flux distributions through PEP carboxykinase and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively. The Cra effect on PEP carboxykinase was probably the consequence of a specific control mechanism, while the Hns effect appears to be unspecific. For central metabolism, the available data thus suggest that a single transcriptional regulation process exerts the dominant control under a given condition and this control is highly specific for a single pathway or cycle within the network.

Oligolysine-based PEG-peptides with 15 or 20 amino acid residues including two cysteines were synthesized to formulate crosslinked polyplex micelles (PMs) incorporating luciferase-coding plasmid DNA (pDNA). Two cysteine residues were separately allocated at the C-terminal, center, or N-terminal of peptide moieties. Although TEM observation showed that all PEG-peptides condensed pDNA into rod-like or toroidal morphologies, the rod length distribution of PMs was affected by both the amino acid sequence and the peptide length of PEG-peptides. In comparison to the cysteine-uninstalled PEG-peptides, the cysteine-installed PEG-peptides exhibited a reductive environment-responsive pDNA release, which was observed in a gel retardation assay. From physicochemical characterizations, a relationship between the amino acid sequence and the in vitro gene expression efficacy of PMs in a cell-free protein synthesis system has been clearly demonstrated. Finally, the cell-based assay using HeLa cells has been tested and the differences between both results of cell-free and cell-based systems are discussed.	DNA	chemistry

Factors to be addressed in determining when to begin treatment are quality of life, prevention of complications, and prevention of disability once complications develop. The goal of preventing diabetic complications rather than achieving glycemic control per se should determine when treatment is initiated. Diabetic complications include a twoto fivefold increased incidence of heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, as well as neuropathy, gangrene and amputation, retinopathy and cataract formation, and hypertension and nephropathy In the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), at initial presentation 20-26% of diabetic patients had retinopathy, 3-7% had evidence of peripheral neuropathy, 1-4% had increased serum creatinine, 19-36% had hypertension, 19% had an abnormal electrocardiogram, 7-13% had abnormal peripheral pulses, and 2% had evidence of a prior myocardial infarction; in addition, 16-20% of the men had experienced impotence. Overall, half of the patients had some evidence of microor macrovascular disease. Extrapolating backward from retinopathy data, once can estimate that on average type 2 diabetes begins 9-12 years prior to diagnosis. In developing countries, late diagnosis is even more common. Of rural Tanzanians with diabetes, 90% do not know they have it, and mortality is 17-26% per year, 10 times greater than that in comparable European diabetic populations. Alberti concluded that earlier intervention is needed. A number of environmental factors contribute to type 2 diabetes. There is evidence that low birth weight is associated with increased risk of subsequent diabetes, as well as with increased risk of obesity, hypertension, and other features of the insulin resistance syndrome, suggesting that an improvement in maternal nutrition during pregnancy might help to prevent diabetes. Measures to prevent obesity, including changing dietary caloric content and composition, as well as encouraging physical activity among those living in cities, would also be important. A highyield strategy for identifying individuals at risk would be to evaluate individuals over age 45 who are overweight or have a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or a family history of diabetes. Specific ethnic groups should be targeted, such as those from India, where the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases from 1.3% in rural areas to 6% in cities; migrant Indian communities such as those in South Africa and in the Fiji islands having diabetes prevalences of 11-13%. Alberti reminded the audience of the new criteria for diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose >126 mg/dl (7 mmol/1) or 2-h post-75-g glucose >200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/1). Early diagnosis can be effective, with a Tanzanian study showing a considerable decrease in the rate of onset of diabetes with lifestyle modification.

34	23234950	1965877536	23234950	A method for localizing microelectrode trajectories in the macaque brain using MRI	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used by electrophysiologists to target specific brain regions for placement of microelectrodes. However, the effectiveness of this technique has been limited by few methods to quantify in three dimensions the relative locations of brain structures, recording chambers and microelectrode trajectories. Here we present such a method. After surgical implantation, recording chambers are fitted with a plastic cylinder that is filled with a high-contrast agent to aid in the segmentation of the cylinder from brain matter in an MRI volume. The resulting images of the filled cylinder correspond to a virtual cylinder that is projected along its long axis - parallel to the trajectories of microelectrodes advanced through the recording chamber - through the three-dimensional image of the brain. This technique, which does not require a stereotaxic coordinate system, can be used to quantify the coverage of an implanted recording chamber relative to anatomical landmarks at any depth or orientation. We have used this technique in conjunction with Caret [Van Essen DC, Drury HA, Dickson J, Harwell J, Hanlon D, Anderson CH. An integrated software suite for surface-based analyses of cerebral cortex. J Am Med Inform Assoc 2001;8:443-59] and AFNI [Cox RW. AFNI: software for analysis and visualization of functional magnetic resonance neuroimages.

Their extralenticular functions remain so far unclear. Here, we explored such roles in the rodent superior olivary complex in which previous analysis demonstrated developmentally regulated expression of Crygd, Cryge and Crygn. Immunohistochemistry with novel antibodies against Crygd/e and Crygn indicate that expression of Crygd/e was moderate and varied between the perinatal superior olivary complex of mice, rats, and gerbils. Crygn-immunoreactivity was more robust and consistently highest in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, but also present in other nuclei of the superior olivary complex. To analyze the function of Crygn in the auditory hindbrain, we used a Crygn allele with a floxed exon 2. Upon pairing with Egr2::Cre mice, exon 2, encoding the first two greek key motifs of Crygn, was deleted in the developing auditory hindbrain. Anatomical analysis of these mice revealed a 20% volume reduction in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and a 7% reduction in the lateral superior olive at postnatal day 25. This was due to cell loss between postnatal days 4 and 25, whereas cell size was unaffected. Auditory brainstem responses showed normal threshold but a significant increase in the amplitude of wave IV. Crygn is hence required for postmigratory survival and proper function of auditory hindbrain neurons. These results ascertain for the first time an essential extralenticular role for γ-crystallins in vivo.	Neurons	metabolism

Materials and Methods: Forty-nine healthy volunteers who underwent kinematic MRI using 2-dimensional balanced subsecond steady-state free precession sequence during forced breathing were included. Several items on the MRI were measured and calculated: these were anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the thorax, APD1, &Dgr;APD, and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the lung field. The results were compared with the results of spirometry. Results: In the comparison between the spirometry results and the MRI kinematic changes, CSA1, &Dgr;CSA, and CSA1% were most significantly correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (right: P<0.001, r=0.814; left: P<0.001, r=0.759); vital capacity (right: P<0.001, r=0.797; left: P<0.001, r=0.780); and forced expiratory volume% in 1 second (right: P<0.001, r=0.530; left: P<0.001, r=0.518), respectively. The APD1 values in the upper position were significantly larger than those in the middle (right: P<0.001; left: P<0.001) and lower (right: P<0.001; left: P<0.001) positions. The &Dgr;APD values in the upper position were also significantly larger than those in the middle (right: P<0.001; left: P<0.001) and lower (right: P<0.001; left: P<0.001) positions. Conclusion: Kinematic MRI with 2-dimensional balanced subsecond steady-state free precession can be used to assess thoracic and diaphragmatic movement during forced breathing. The dynamic changes in CSA correlated well with the results of spirometry.	Lung	physiology

Moreover, it is possible that infliximab could also be useful in inducing and/or maintaining remission, as TNF-α is important in the homeostasis of T lymphocytes. In fact, it has been recently described that anti-TNF-α therapy is able to exert a positive influence on a special population of regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+) that is functionally defective in various autoimmune diseases. In this sense it is noteworthy that, in our patient, serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were undetectable after three infusions of infliximab. However, serum IFN-γ levels (a cytokine secreted mainly by CD4+ T lymphocytes) were raised from undetectable to 974 pg/mL after three infusions, suggesting an effect on T lymphocytes. As far as we know, this is the first report regarding the use of anti-TNFα in childhood cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. We suggest that in children with CPAN refractory to standard treatments, infliximab might be a safe and valuable treatment in controlling flares, as well as inducing and maintaining remission. Further studies are required to clearly define its use and safety.	Skin Neoplasms	chemically induced
38	2895082	2119849253	2895082	Estrogen Receptor Genotypes and Haplotypes Associated with Breast Cancer Risk	Nearly one in eight US women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Most breast cancer is not associated with a hereditary syndrome, occurs in postmenopausal women, and is estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive. Estrogen exposure is an epidemiologic risk factor for breast cancer and estrogen is a potent mammary mitogen. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in estrogen receptors in 615 healthy subjects and 1011 individuals with histologically confirmed breast cancer, all from New York City. We analyzed 13 SNPs in the progesterone receptor gene (PGR), 17 SNPs in estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1), and 8 SNPs in the estrogen receptor 2 gene (ESR2). We observed three common haplotypes in ESR1 that were associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer [odds ratio (OR), ∼ O.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2–0.8; P < 0.01]. Another haplotype was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.8; P < 0.05). A unique risk haplotype was present in ∼7% of older Ashkenazi Jewish study subjects (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.4; P < 0.003). We narrowed the ESR1 risk haplotypes to the promoter region and first exon. We define several other haplotypes in Ashkenazi Jews in both ESR1 and ESR2 that may elevate susceptibility to breast cancer. In contrast, we found no association between any PGR variant or haplotype and breast cancer. Genetic epidemiology study replication and functional assays of the haplotypes should permit a better understanding of the role of steroid receptor genetic variants and breast cancer risk.

To clarify the pathogenicity of A. baumannii in the elderly, we investigated immune responses to A. baumannii ATCC 19606 infection in klotho knockout (KO) mice, the mouse model of aging. Following intravenous inoculation, the mice seldom displayed severe symptoms. However, the survival rate was 56% at 7 days post-infection. Bacteria were detected in the lungs of klotho KO mice but not klotho wildtype (WT) mice at 7 days post-infection. Neutrophils, eosinophils, interstitial macrophages, and monocyte/dendritic cell subset in the lungs of klotho KO mice were transiently induced after infection with A. baumannii. The number of alveolar macrophages in klotho KO mice was lower than that in klotho WT mice, except for 1 day post-infection. CD11b expression on neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in the lungs of klotho KO mice was seldom upregulated by the infection. These results suggested that immune functions eliminating bacteria in the lungs of klotho KO mice were insufficient. CD11blow conventional DC cells hardly increased in klotho KO mice infected with A. baumannii. Additionally, the production of interleukin (IL)-10 in the sera of klotho KO mice was significantly higher than that in klotho WT mice, whereas that production of interferon-gamma was not detected in the sera of klotho KO mice. These results suggested that acquired immune responses were hardly induced in klotho KO mice. IL-1β, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2 expression was significantly higher in the lungs of klotho KO mice infected with A. baumannii than in those of klotho WT mice at 1 day post-infection. These results suggested that pulmonary inflammation was elicited in klotho KO mice during early infection. The expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly correlated with TLR9 expression in the lungs of klotho KO mice. The collective results demonstrate an A. baumannii infection state in aged hosts and suggest that pulmonary inflammation and bacterial burden should be noted in aged hosts even in the absence of severe symptoms of A. baumannii infection.

40	1161081	2110784606	1161081	Soluble leptin receptor in serum of subjects with complete resistance to leptin: relation to fat mass.	Leptin resistance and obesity have been related to mutations of the leptin receptor gene in rodents and, recently, in a consanguineous family. The latter mutation results in a receptor lacking transmembrane and intracellular domains. Homozygous and heterozygous individuals with this mutation had serum leptin levels higher than expected, given their BMIs: 600, 670, and 526 ng/ml and 145, 362, 294, 240, and 212 ng/ml, respectively. Their serum leptin was fractionated by gel filtration: >80% was present as a high-molecular size complex vs. 7.5% in the nonmutated sister. Western blot analysis showed a band at 146 kDa reacting specifically with an antibody directed against the leptin receptor ectodomain. In 10 obese control subjects, as in the mutated patients, free leptin levels correlated with BMI (r = 0.70, P = 0.0011) and reflected fat mass, regardless of leptin receptor functioning. In the patients, bound leptin levels correlated with BMI (r = 0.99, P = 0.0002) and were related to the number of mutated alleles. These data demonstrate that the truncated receptor is secreted into blood and binds the majority of serum leptin, markedly increasing bound and total leptin. Free serum leptin was similarly correlated with BMI in the mutated and nonmutated obese individuals, providing evidence that the relationship between BMI and circulating free leptin is preserved in this family. This finding suggests that the leptin receptor itself may not be specifically involved in the control of leptin secretion, and it supports the concept of relative resistance to leptin in common obesity.

41	195327953	2950516996	195327953	Frequent amplifications of ESR1, ERBB2 and MDM4 in primary invasive lobular breast carcinoma.	Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer following invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). To identify potential genetic drivers of ILC progression, we used NanoString nCounter technology to investigate the DNA copy number (CN) in 70 well-curated primary ILC samples. We confirmed prior observations of frequent amplification of CCND1 (33%), and MYC (17%) in ILC, but additionally identified a substantial subset of ILCs with ESR1 and ERBB2 (19%) amplifications. Of interest, tumors with ESR1 CN gains (14%) and amplification (10%) were more likely to recur compared to those with normal CN. Finally, we observed that MDM4 (MDMX) was amplified in 17% of ILC samples. MDM4 knockdown in TP53 wild-type ILC cell lines caused increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation associated with cell cycle arrest, and concomitant activation of TP53 target genes. Similar effects were seen in TP53 mutant cells, indicting a TP53-independent role for MDM4 in ILC. To conclude, amplification of ESR1 and MDM4 are potential genetic drivers of ILC. These amplifications may represent actionable, targetable tumor dependencies, and thus have potential clinical implications and warrant further study.	Breast Neoplasms	pathology
42	84447736	2035960483	84447736	Ligands Differentially Modulate the Protein Interactions of the Human Estrogen Receptors α and β	The interactions of human estrogen receptor subtypes ERalpha and ERbeta with DNA and a 210 amino acid residue fragment of the coactivator protein SRC-1 bearing three nuclear receptor interaction motifs were investigated quantitatively using fluorescence anisotropy in the presence of agonist and antagonist ligands. ERalpha and ERbeta were found to bind in a similar manner to DNA, and both salt and temperature affected the affinity and/or stoichiometry of these interactions. The agonist ligands estradiol, estrone and estriol did not modify the binding of ERalpha to the fluorescein-labeled target estrogen response element. However, in the case of ERbeta, these ligands led to the formation of some higher-order protein-DNA complexes and a small decrease in affinity. The partial agonist 4-hydroxytamoxifen had little effect on either ER subtype, whereas the pure antagonist ICI 182,780 led to the cooperative formation of protein-DNA complexes of higher order than dimer, as further demonstrated by competition experiments and gel mobility-shift assays. In addition to DNA binding, the interaction of both ER subtypes with the Alexa488-labeled SRC-1 coactivator fragment was investigated by fluorescence anisotropy. The agonist ligands estrone, estradiol, estriol, genistein and ethynyl estradiol exhibited distinct capacities for inducing the recruitment of SRC-1 that were not correlated with their affinity for the receptor. Moreover, estrone and genistein exhibited subtype specificity in that they induced SRC-1 recruitment to ERbeta with much higher efficiency than in the case of ERalpha. The differential coactivator recruitment capacities of the ER agonists and their receptor subtype coactivator recruitment specificity may be linked to the molecular structure of the agonists with respect to their interactions with a specific histidine residue located at the back of the ligand-binding pocket. Altogether, these quantitative in vitro studies of ER interactions reveal the complex energetic and stoichiometric consequences of changes in the chemical structures of these proteins and their ligands.

44	6345850	2065681647	6345850	Ephrin regulation of synapse formation, function and plasticity	Synapses enable the transmission of information within neural circuits and allow the brain to change in response to experience. During the last decade numerous proteins that can induce synapse formation have been identified. Many of these synaptic inducers rely on trans-synaptic cell-cell interactions to generate functional contacts. Moreover, evidence now suggests that the same proteins that function early in development to regulate synapse formation may help to maintain and/or regulate the function and plasticity of mature synapses. One set of receptors and ligands that appear to impact both the development and the mature function of synapses are Eph receptors (erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and their surface associated ligands, ephrins (Eph family receptor interacting proteins). Ephs can initiate new synaptic contacts, recruit and stabilize glutamate receptors at nascent synapses and regulate dendritic spine morphology. Recent evidence demonstrates that ephrin ligands also play major roles at synapses. Activation of ephrins by Eph receptors can induce synapse formation and spine morphogenesis, whereas in the mature nervous system ephrin signaling modulates synaptic function and long-term changes in synaptic strength. In this review we will summarize the recent progress in understanding the role of ephrins in presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation, and synapse development, function and plasticity.

The authors underline that this is a topic to which little attention has been given, and suggest that `more robust trials are needed' to overcome the multiple drawbacks of previous reports. In this letter I would like to discuss some data that were not included in that review and provide some comments that, I hope, will improve future research on this subject. The authors did not comment on two reports from our laboratory on body weight changes in healthy volunteers after sulpiride (SUL) or placebo administration (2, 3). It was a valuable opportunity to examine drug effects on weight regulation without the confounding contribution of severe mental disorders. Onemonth SUL administration did not affect weight in women and induced a small weight gain in men. These results support the ®ndings obtained in clinical populations on the low propensity of amisulpiride (a drug with a similar pharmacological pro®le to SUL) to induce signi®cant weight gain (4). The remarkable lack of effect of SUL on body weight in humans contrasts with its strong and reliable effect in rats. In fact, an animal model of AP-induced obesity has been developed (5, 6). Contrary to that observed in humans during AP administration (7, 8), weight gain after SUL in rats is observed only in females (9) and (unexpectedly) their serum leptin and insulin levels are not increased (6, 10). Hence, important differences may exist between animals and humanswith regard to body weight regulation during AP treatment that must be considered in future studies. To complicate the picture even more, the diverse AP differ considerably in their af®nity and interaction with brain amines and peptides (8, 11), many of them playing important roles in feeding regulation. As an example, consider the interaction of AP with D2 dopamine receptors, which will determine, at least partially, whether or not hyperprolactinemia will be observed. Prolactin is involved in weight and feeding regulation (8), and its contribution to AP-induced weight gain has received very little attention. Therefore, results obtained with APs that increase prolactin are not strictly comparable with studies conducted with APs that do not affect prolactin. From a clinical perspective, the following factors may in ̄uence the response of body weight regulation system to AP administration: the speci®c mental disorder, sex, age, race, body weight before starting AP treatment, family history of obesity, concomitant endocrine disorders (diabetes, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary, among others), and simultaneous use of other drugs (lithium, tricyclic antidepressants) (8). Future studies must consider these important variables. Lastly, in the therapeutic arena, diverse drugs are available to counteract the AP-blocking effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors (8). However, psychiatrists do not appear to have many pharmacological tools to speci®cally counteract the strong appetite-stimulating actions of AP that also block brain histamine receptors. Effects on the histaminergic system appear to play a prominent role in the mechanisms by which the atypical AP increase body weight (11) but again, as Taylor and McAskill assert, more robust and original studies are needed.

The similar neurological disorders were found in both groups of animals. The data on pathological and morphological changes in the medulla oblongata as dystrophic and necrotic changes in the neurons with their lysis and deletion, brain tissue edema, and hemodynamic changes confirmed the neutrotropicity of the strains under study. The revealed pattern of brain lesions did not depend on the time of isolation of the viral strains being examined.	Brain	virology

The acute biochemical effects of the venom of the Egyptian Cobra (Naje haje) on rabbit brain tissue were studied. Cystine, alanine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glutathione, isoleucine and serotonin contents of the brain were decreased after injection of the venom. On the other hand brain glutamic oxaloacetic (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic (GPT) transaminases activities were increased. Cholinesterase activity of brain was significantly decreased. The phospholipid content of brain showed considerable hydrolysis (phospholipase activity of the venom), liberating free unsaturated fatty acid which were not found in the control brains (linolenic acid). 
 
 
 
These biochemical changes in rabbit brain after injection of the venom demonstrate its strong neurotoxic effects which could be specific and diagnostic parameters for the toxicity of this snake.

48	206027976	1971617987	206027976	The Journal of Clinical Hypertension Has Become the Official Journal of the World Hypertension League	For many years The Journal of Clinical Hypertension (JCH) has been a major resource for research, clinical practice, and healthcare policy in the broad realm of hypertension. JCH has been fortunate that so many leaders in these domains have contributed reports of original studies, scholarly review articles, and critical commentaries to the pages of the Journal. Clearly this support has been the basis for making JCH such an influential force in hypertension. Thanks to its new partnership with the World Hypertension League (WHL), the editors of the Journal—together with its publisher, Wiley—are poised to take the next major step in embracing the full spectrum of clinical hypertension and making JCH the preeminent journal in the field. The WHL is a remarkable entity. One of its major roles is to serve as the umbrella organization for national societies of hypertension—currently 42 of them—including such major ones as the American Society of Hypertension, the Chinese Hypertension League, the International Society of Hypertension in Blacks, the Hypertension Society of India, and the Russian Society of Hypertension. As well, the WHL partners with organizations such as The National Forum for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention in the implementation of prevention and disease management strategies. This allows WHL to have a truly global reach in defining public health and policy agendas and in providing education and guidance in the practice of hypertension and other areas of preventive medicine. In support of these large-scale international commitments, the WHL has established formal relationships with both the World Health Organization in Geneva and the International Society of Hypertension. Readers not familiar with the full scope of the WHL’s activities can visit their Web site (www.worldhypertensionleague. org) for further information. As a practical expression of our new relationship, JCH will soon be publishing official WHL position papers and fact sheets designed to define policy and provide support for clinicians and other public health leaders on such issues as dietary salt, definitions of hypertension, and the use of semi-automated blood pressure devices. Beyond that, we expect to publish original research articles and reviews that encompass a broad range of related topics. Needless to say, JCH intends to continue its commitment to all aspects of clinical hypertension. We strongly invite authors to submit their work in related areas including, but not limited to: drug trials or other therapeutic interventions; studies of patient compliance with treatment and ways to improve it; population studies and epidemiology of hypertension; predictors of hypertension; associations with concomitant conditions; pharmacoeconomics and other cost issues; diagnostic features of hypertension, including studies of arterial stiffness, central blood pressure, and other vascular measurements; relationships between blood biomarkers and hypertension; basic science and molecular biology studies that help define the clinical characteristics of hypertension; research on the effects of hypertension on target organs, particularly coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction, stroke and other central nervous system events, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral artery disease; and treatment-resistant hypertension. In short, we put no limits on interesting work that contributes to our understanding and management of hypertension! In January of this year, JCH published a major hypertension guideline paper titled, “Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in the Community: A Statement by the American Society of Hypertension and the International Society of Hypertension.” This work was targeted at practitioners throughout the world and was written in such a way as to be applicable to hypertension care regardless of local economic or social conditions. While this effort has already been very enthusiastically received, it will soon be necessary to begin the work of updating and expanding the guideline so that it can continue to be a major resource for practitioners on the front lines of managing hypertension. The exciting new relationship between the WHL and JCH will provide a powerful impetus for this critical endeavor.	Hypertension	prevention & control

"Biological macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins can be regarded as finite sequences of symbols (or words) over a finite alphabet. In this paper, we refer to DNA (RNA) sequences which are words on a four-letter alphabet. A comparison is made between some ""genes"", or fragments of them, with random sequences or random reshuffled sequences on the same alphabet and having the same length. Some combinatorial techniques of analysis of finite words are developed. A crucial role in the comparison is played by the so-called special factors of a given word. In all the analysed DNA (RNA) fragments the distribution on the length of the number of right (left) special factors differs, in a very typical way, from the corresponding distribution in a string on the same alphabet and having the same length generated by a random source or obtained by making a random alteration (=shuffling) of the original string. This kind of change is irrespective of the length in the range that we have considered <2650 bp and of the phylogenetic origin of the fragment."	DNA	genetics

While programs exist for displaying protein translations in multiple ORFs in alignment with a DNA sequence, they are often expensive, exist as add-ons to software that must be purchased, or are only compatible with a particular operating system. JavaScript DNA Translator is a shareware application written in JavaScript, a scripting language interpreted by the Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer Web browsers, which makes it compatible with several different operating systems. While the program uses a familiar Web page interface, it requires no connection to the Internet since calculations are performed on the user's own computer. The program analyzes one or multiple DNA sequences and generates translations in up to six reading frames aligned to a DNA sequence, in addition to displaying translations as separate sequences in FASTA format. ORFs within a reading frame can also be displayed as separate sequences. Flexible formatting options are provided, including the ability to hide ORFs below a minimum size specified by the user. The program is available free of charge at the BioTechniques Software Library (www.Biotechniques.com).	DNA	genetics

53	43330753	2619926102	43330753	Population Based Image Imputation	We present an algorithm for creating high resolution anatomically plausible images consistent with acquired clinical brain MRI scans with large inter-slice spacing. Although large databases of clinical images contain a wealth of information, medical acquisition constraints result in sparse scans that miss much of the anatomy. These characteristics often render computational analysis impractical as standard processing algorithms tend to fail when applied to such images. Highly specialized or application-specific algorithms that explicitly handle sparse slice spacing do not generalize well across problem domains. In contrast, our goal is to enable application of existing algorithms that were originally developed for high resolution research scans to significantly undersampled scans. We introduce a model that captures fine-scale anatomical similarity across subjects in clinical image collections and use it to fill in the missing data in scans with large slice spacing. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current upsampling methods and promises to facilitate subsequent analysis not previously possible with scans of this quality.

54	24337029	2030667418	24337029	Complete Response of a Recurrent, Multicentric Malignant Glioma in a Patient Treated with Phenylbutyrate	Sodium phenylbutyrate is a biological-response modifier that acts as a dose-dependent inhibitor of glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in vitro, possibly by inhibition of urokinase and c-myc pathways. Despite its biological activity in vitro, there have not been any prior reports of efficacy in the treatment of human malignant gliomas.We report a 44-year-old female with a recurrent, multicentric, malignant glioma who experienced a durable remission lasting more than four years. The patient initially presented with seizures caused by a biopsy-proven anaplastic astrocytoma of the frontal lobe. The patient was treated with radiation therapy and Procarbazine–CCNU–Vincristine (PCV). However, the tumor progressed and extended to the corpus callosum with midline shift, refractory to four cycles of continuous 72-h infusion of BCNU/Cisplatinum. Additional enhancing lesions appeared in the left frontal and left temporal lobes. The patient was started on sodium phenylbutyrate, 18 g daily in three divided oral doses, and reduced to 9 g/day and eventually to 4.5 g/day to eliminate mild, reversible side effects. Four years later, the patient has a KPS functional score of 100%. Phenylbutyrate is a well-tolerated, oral agent that shows potential for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Further studies should be considered to identify a subset of patients that have tumors sensitive to phenylbutyrate, either as a single agent or in combination with radiation therapy or other chemotherapeutic agents.

New treatments are therefore wanted. The conditionally replicative adenovirus Ad5-Δ24RGD has shown promising anti-tumor effects on local cancers, including OS. The purpose of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of Ad5-Δ24RGD could suppress growth of human OS lung metastases. Mice bearing SaOs-lm7 OS lung metastases were treated with Ad5-Δ24RGD at weeks 1, 2 and 3 or weeks 5, 6 and 7 after tumor cell injection. Virus treatment at weeks 1–3 did not cause a statistically significant effect on lung weight and total body weight. However, the number of macroscopic lung tumor nodules was reduced from a median of >158 in PBS-treated control mice to 58 in Ad5-Δ24RGD-treated mice (p = 0.15). Moreover, mice treated at weeks 5–7 showed a significantly reduced lung weight (decrease of tumor mass, p < 0.05), a significantly increased body weight gain (decrease of disease symptoms, p < 0.005) and a reduced number of macroscopic lung tumor nodules (median 60 versus > 149, p = 0.12) compared to PBS treated control animals. Adenovirus hexon expression was detected in lung tumor nodules at sacrifice three weeks after the last intravenous adenovirus administration, suggesting ongoing viral infection. These findings suggest that systemic administration of Ad5-Δ24RGD might be a promising new treatment strategy for metastatic osteosarcoma.	Lung Neoplasms	therapy

We hypothesized that lapatinib, a HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, would be active in these tumors. We have studied the correlation between p95HER2 expression and response to lapatinib, both in preclinical models and in the clinical setting. Experimental Design: Two different p95HER2 animal models were used for preclinical studies. Expression of p95HER2 was analyzed in HER2-overexpressing breast primary tumors from a first-line lapatinib monotherapy study (EGF20009) and a second-line lapatinib in combination with capecitabine study (EGF100151). p95HER2 expression was correlated with overall response rate (complete + partial response), clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥24 wk), and progression-free survival using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Lapatinib inhibited tumor growth and the HER2 downstream signaling of p95HER2-expressing tumors. A total of 68 and 156 tumors from studies EGF20009 and EGF100151 were evaluable, respectively, for p95HER2 detection. The percentage of p95HER2-positive patients was 20.5% in the EGF20009 study and 28.5% in the EGF100151 study. In both studies, there was no statistically significant difference in progression-free survival, clinical benefit rate, and overall response rate between p95HER2-positive and p95HER2-negative tumors. Conclusions: Lapatinib as a monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine seems to be equally effective in patients with p95HER2-positive and p95HER2-negative HER2-positive breast tumors.

57	26362285	2067792274	26362285	Components of the GABA system in mice selectively bred for differences in open-field activity	Mice selectively bred for differences in open-field activity were utilized to test the hypothesis that differences in open-field behaviour are mediated at least in part by components of the GABA system, including brain glutamic acid decarboxylase activity (V, Vmax, and Km), as well as glutamate and GABA concentrations. Enzyme velocity was found to be inversely correlated with open-field activity, but it accounted for less than 15% of the variance. Moreover, the rank order of the lines was not as predicted for a genetically correlated character and the magnitude of the differences in enzyme activity among the lines was not large. It was therefore concluded that the GABA system is not an important mediator of differences in open-field behaviour in these lines of mice.	Brain	metabolism
58	13371264	2059613806	13371264	Occupational Exposures, Environmental Tobacco Smoke, and Lung Cancer	Background: There is uncertainty regarding the association of occupational exposures with lung cancer. We have studied the association between 52 high-risk job titles and lung cancer incidence in a large prospective study, with more than 200,000 participants followed for more than 6 years and 809 incident cases of lung cancer. Methods: Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed by the Cox proportional-hazard regression model, adjusting for country, age, sex, social class, diet, physical activity, and smoking habits. We used a CAREX-based job-exposure matrix to infer exposure to lung carcinogens. False-positive report probability was calculated as a measure of potentially false-positive results. Results: Eighteen occupations, mainly related with agriculture, constructions, and metal processing, were associated with increased risk. In addition, incidence tended to increase with the number of hazardous jobs reported. When the occupations were classified according to the presumed exposure to specific carcinogenic agents, the hazard ratios were 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.2–1.9) for asbestos, 1.4 (1.1–1.8) for heavy metals, 1.4 (1.1–1.8) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 1.6 (1.2–2.1) for work-related environmental tobacco smoke. The estimated population attributable risk for employment in at least 1 at-risk job was 16% in men and 12% in women. Conclusions: This large prospective study suggests that exposure to occupational lung carcinogens is still a problem, with such exposures producing moderate to large increases in risk.

59	12577989	2094230684	12577989	Pathology and pathogenesis of idiopathic portal hypertension with an emphasis on the liver.	Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is characterized by a long-standing presinusoidal portal hypertension of unknown etiology in adults. Some unidentified agent(s) affect(s) the intrahepatic small portal veins or portal tracts. Immunological disturbance, thromboembolism, infectious etiology and/or increased fibrogenesis in portal tracts are suspected as being candidates for the primary agent(s). During the long clinical course of IPH, several pathological changes may occur, including subcapsular parenchymal atrophy, atrophy of the liver, portal and parenchymal fibrosis, and portal venous phlebosclerosis and thrombosis. The last-named of these lesions is mostly found in patients with a history of splenectomy. Subcapsular parenchymal and hepatic atrophy may result from a hepatocellular dropout via apoptosis or necrosis because of intrahepatic hemodynamic disturbances, particularly chronic portal venous blood insufficiency. Pericellular fibrosis and thin fibrous septa are also frequently found and associated with activated perisinusoidal cells positive for smooth muscle actin. At the same time, vague nodular hyperplasia of hepatocytes not surrounded by fibrous septa is not infrequently seen. It may resemble nodular regenerative hyperplasia, partial nodular transformation, or focal nodular hyperplasia. However, liver cirrhosis does not occur even at the terminal stage. Taking these findings into consideration, a new staging of IPH with a combination of hepatic parenchymal atrophy and portal venous thrombosis was proposed: non-atrophic liver without subcapsular parenchymal atrophy (stage I), non-atrophic liver with subcapsular parenchymal atrophy (stage II), atrophic liver with subcapsular parenchymal atrophy (stage III), and portal venous occlusive thrombosis (stage IV). IPH livers are likely to progress from stage I to stage III. Stage IV, which occurs relatively late, has a poor prognosis. This staging is applicable to clinical and autopsy cases without any histological data.	Liver	pathology
60	19215254	1751817085	19215254	Tractography atlas-based spatial statistics: Statistical analysis of diffusion tensor image along fiber pathways	The quantitative analysis of diffusion tensor image (DTI) data has attracted increasing attention in recent decades for studying white matter (WM) integrity and development. Among the current DTI analysis methods, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), as a pioneering approach for the voxelwise analysis of DTI data, has gained a lot of popularity due to its user-friendly framework. However, in recent years, the reliability and interpretability of TBSS have been challenged by several works, and several improvements over the original TBSS pipeline have been suggested. In this paper, we propose a new DTI statistical analysis method, named tractography atlas-based spatial statistics (TABSS). It doesn't rely on the accurate alignment of fractional anisotropy (FA) images for population analysis and gets rid of the skeletonization procedures of TBSS, which have been indicated as the major sources of error. Furthermore, TABSS improves the interpretability of results by directly reporting the resulting statistics on WM tracts, waiving the need of a WM atlas in the interpretation of the results. The feasibility of TABSS was evaluated in an example study to show age-related FA alternation pattern of healthy human brain. Through this preliminary study, it is validated that TABSS can provide detailed statistical results in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand way.	Brain	anatomy & histology

Detection of hematogenous micrometastases (MM) in bone marrow might play important role in determining stage, prognosis and multimodality treatment strategy of invasive breast cancer. Therefore we studied the presence of occult tumor cells in bone marrow of outpatients operated on with breast cancer by detecting cytokeratin 20 mRNA using the RT-PCR method. In 182 primary breast cancer patients 54 (29.7%) micrometastases were detected while in 128 patients (70.3%) no tumor cells were found in the bone marrow aspirates. Correlation of MM with HER-2, c-met, nm23, p53 and estrogen receptor (ER) were studied. The presence of MM was correlated with HER-2, nm23- and p53 positivity and with low frequency of nm23 and ER. The possible role of bone marrow MM in selecting node negative breast cancer patients for adjuvant therapy should be tested in randomized prospective clinical trials.	Breast Neoplasms	pathology
62	26343287	2047659511	26343287	Juxtamedullary afferent and efferent arterioles constrict to renal nerve stimulation.	Sympathetic neural control of afferent and efferent arterioles of inner cortical (juxtamedullary) glomeruli has not been established, in part, because of difficulty accessing these vessels, normally located deep below the kidney surface. In this study we utilized the rat hydronephrotic kidney model to visualize the renal microcirculation and to quantitate the responses of juxtamedullary arterioles to brief (30 sec) renal nerve stimulated (RNS). Juxtamedullary afferent and efferent arterioles constricted in a frequency-dependent fashion to RNS, achieving a maximal constriction of 35% to 8 Hz stimulation. In these same kidneys, outer cortical afferent arterioles also constricted to RNS but outer cortical efferent arterioles did not. Microinjection of norepinephrine (NE) around single outer cortical efferent arterioles (to avoid the constriction of preglomerular vessels) constricted the efferent arterioles. However, the afferent arterioles of the same glomeruli were considerably more responsive to microinjected NE. Thus, the lack of constriction of outer cortical efferent arterioles to RNS may relate, in part, to their low sensitivity to NE, the primary neurotransmitter. These direct observations indicate that the juxtamedullary efferent arterioles are responsive to renal nerve stimulation whereas the outer cortical efferent vessels are not. These results, which should be cautiously extrapolated to normal filtering kidneys, indicate that glomerular hemodynamic changes evoked by the sympathetic nervous system are different for outer cortical and inner cortical glomeruli.

Methods Tumor sections from 22 patients (11 patients free of disease after 3 years and 11 patients with recurrence) were stained histoimmunochemically for factor VIII-related antigens. Vessel counting in the most active area of angiogenesis was performed by two pathologists on a × 200 microscopic field (0.739 mm2) without knowledge of the patients' outcome. To predict recurrence, vessel count was compared with age, tumor size, tumor grade, lymph-vascular invasion, duration of follow-up, and type of therapy. Results Only high microvessel count (mean 19.9, range 7–43, versus mean 30.1, range 17–78; P < .05) and tumor size (mean 2.84 cm, range 1–4.2, versus mean 4.11 cm, range 2.2–6; P < .05) were independent factors predicting recurrence. Conclusion High microvessel count in tumors may be used to predict recurrence in stage Ib squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.	Carcinoma, Squamous Cell	blood supply

We used three major cross-sectional population-based surveys to study the association of parental longevity with successful aging in offspring. The measures of aging were hand-grip strength, cognitive performance (Mini Mental State Examination and a cognitive composite score), self-reported diseases, and self-rated health. Results. For every additional 10 years the parents lived, their children’s grip strength increased by 0.32 kg (95% CI = 0.00–0.63), Mini Mental State Examination score by 0.20 points (95% CI = 0.03–0.37), and cognitive composite score by 0.24 points (95% CI = 0.07–0.40). A 10-year increment of parental life was associated with a reduction by approximately 0.20 in the adjusted odds ratio for their children having each of the following conditions: diabetes; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; heart failure; stroke; or fair, poor, or very poor self-rated health. Almost all the effects were seen solely in the cohort of 70+-year-olds, but not among middle-aged or nonagenarian subjects. Conclusions. Parental life span is positively associated with the children’s physical and cognitive functioning and avoidance of some of the common chronic diseases. However, the effects are small and are seen among offspring who are elderly, but not among the middle-aged or the oldest old.	Aging	physiology

Experience had with percutaneous puncture treatment under echographic control in 122 patients presenting kidney cysts is shared. The indications and contraindications for treatment, puncture technique applied and drugs used for cyst epithelium sclerosis are discussed, followed by a description of an original method of cyst cavity draining. In all patients with cyst drainage duely performed the outcome of treatment is successful. Good therapeutic results upon using sclerosing substances are attained in 88.7 per cent, while in cysts not subjected to medication-in 64.3 per cent, or else the total of positive outcomes amounts to 81.8 per cent. After puncture, it is advised to insert a drain into the cystic cavity, and invariably administer sclerosing substances. The readily performed technique of puncture, lack of serious complications, short hospitalization and prompt recovery of the ability for work are unquestionable advantages of the method proposed. In case of cyst recurrence it is possible to perform secondary puncture.	Kidney	diagnostic imaging

To study the possibility that the state of proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes can influence the action of retinoids, the rate of proliferation of murine epidermal keratinocytes was manipulated by growing the cells in media containing high or low concentrations of Ca++. In contrast to what other investigators have reported, keratinocytes cultured in medium containing 1.4 mM Ca++ proliferate faster, instead of slower, than cells cultured in medium with 0.09 mM Ca++. Other experiments showed that Ca++ was stimulatory to keratinocytes in medium containing a low level of growth factors, and inhibitory in medium containing a high level of growth factors, suggesting that the discrepancy could be due to a difference in the sera used. The high Ca++ cells prominently expressed the 48kD/56kD pair of keratin, showing that they were in a hyperproliferative state. Exposure of the faster growing high Ca++ cells to all-trans retinoic acid, 13-cis retinoic acid, etretinate, etretin, and arotinoid ethyl ester caused dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis. In contrast, exposure of the slower growing low Ca++ cells to these retinoids resulted in dose-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis. In addition, all-trans retinoic acid caused dose-related increases in cell number in the low Ca++ cultures. These findings correlate with the reported differential effects of retinoids on normal and hyperproliferative epidermis, and suggest that Ca++ and low growth factor-regulated keratinocyte cultures are useful for studying the mechanism of hyperproliferation and retinoid actions.

68	30298564	2331547724	30298564	Effects of dietary soybean globulins on plasma and liver lipids and on fecal excretion of neutral sterols in rats.	Effects of low-fat (1% corn oil) diets containing an isonitrogenous level (3.2%) of either casein, soybean protein isolate or three soybean globulin fractions (total, 11S and 7S globulins) on plasma and liver lipids and on the excretion of fecal neutral sterols were examined in rats. When diets free of cholesterol were fed, the concentration of plasma cholesterol was significantly lower in all groups of rats given different soybean proteins than in the animals given casein. 11S globulin tended to produce a lower level of plasma cholesterol as compared with the 7S counterpart. Although the net decrease due to feeding plant proteins in high density lipoprotein cholesterol was to some extent greater than that of very low and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, the percentage of the former to total cholesterol remained in the normal range. The concentration of liver cholesterol appeared to be lower in rats given soybean proteins. Rats fed soybean globulins, as compared with the animals fed casein, tended to excrete larger amounts of neutral sterol into the feces. These soybean-effects disappeared when cholesterol and cholic acid were added to diets. The results indicated that the antihypercholesterolemic effect of soybean protein was attributable to protein per se, and not to the carbohydrate components which were associated with the protein preparation.

69	31993189	39348695	31993189	Clozapine: Selective Labeling of Sites Resembling 5HT6 Serotonin Receptors May Reflect Psychoactive Profile	BackgroundClozapine, the classic atypical neuroleptic, exerts therapeutic actions in schizophrenic patients unresponsive to most neuroleptics. Clozapine interacts with numerous neurotransmitter receptors, and selective actions at novel subtypes of dopamine and serotonin receptors have been proposed to explain clozapine’s unique psychotropic effects. To identify sites with which clozapine preferentially interacts in a therapeutic setting, we have characterized clozapine binding to brain membranes.Materials and Methods[3H]Clozapine binding was examined in rat brain membranes as well as cloned-expressed 5-HT6 serotonin receptors.Results[3H]Clozapine binds with low nanomolar affinity to two distinct sites. One reflects muscarinic receptors consistent with the drug’s anticholinergic actions. The drug competition profile of the second site most closely resembles 5HT6 serotonin receptors, though serotonin itself displays low affinity. [3H]Clozapine binding levels are similar in all brain regions examined with no concentration in the corpus striatum.ConclusionsBesides muscarinic receptors, clozapine primarily labels sites with properties resembling 5HT6 serotonin receptors. If this is also the site with which clozapine principally interacts in intact human brain, it may account for the unique beneficial actions of clozapine and other atypical neuroleptics, and provide a molecular target for developing new, safer, and more effective agents.

70	4362047	2520950700	4362047	Targeting interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 for human hepatocellular carcinoma	BackgroundInterleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), as a down-stream of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, plays important roles in series of malignancies. However, the role of IRAK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains little known.MethodsIn our study, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Western Blot, and immunohistochemical staining were used to assess the mRNA and protein levels of IRAK1 in clinical samples and cell lines. Cell counting assay and flow cytometry were employed to analyze the effect of IRAK1 on cell cycle and apoptosis. Transwell assay was used to study the role of IRAK1 in cell migration. Moreover, subcutaneous xenograft tumor models predict the efficacy of targeting IRAK1 against HCC in vivo.ResultsIRAK1 was over-expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. Suppression of IRAK1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) or a pharmaceutical IRAK1/4 inhibitor impeded cell growth, induced apoptosis and lessened HCC xenograft tumor growth. Particularly, IRAK1/4 inhibitor treatment caused G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, confirming IRAK1 as a new therapeutic target for HCC.ConclusionIRAK1 promotes cell proliferation and protects against apoptosis in HCC, and can be a novel target for HCC treatment.

71	38345322	872508724	38345322	The dopaminergic response to acute stress in health and psychopathology: A systematic review	Previous work in animals has shown that dopamine (DA) in cortex and striatum plays an essential role in stress processing. For the first time, we systematically reviewed the in vivo evidence for DAergic stress processing in health and psychopathology in humans. All studies included (n studies=25, n observations=324) utilized DA D2/3 positron emission tomography and measured DAergic activity during an acute stress challenge. The evidence in healthy volunteers (HV) suggests that physiological, but not psychological, stress consistently increases striatal DA release. Instead, increased medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) DAergic activity in HV was observed during psychological stress. Across brain regions, stress-related DAergic activity was correlated with the physiological and psychological intensity of the stressor. The magnitude of stress-induced DA release was dependent on rearing conditions, personality traits and genetic variations in several SNPs. In psychopathology, preliminary evidence was found for stress-related dorsal striatal DAergic hyperactivity in psychosis spectrum and a blunted response in chronic cannabis use and pain-related disorders, but results were inconsistent. Physiological stress-induced DAergic activity in striatum in HV may reflect somatosensory properties of the stressor and readiness for active fight-or-flight behavior. DAergic activity in HV in the ventral striatum and mPFC may be more related to expectations about the stressor and threat evaluation, respectively. Future studies with increased sample size in HV and psychopathology assessing the functional relevance of stress-induced DAergic activity, the association between cortical and subcortical DAergic activity and the direct comparison of different stressors are necessary to conclusively elucidate the role of the DA system in the stress response.

72	18768999	2015054653	18768999	Altered mechanical properties of titin immunoglobulin domain 27 in the presence of calcium	Titin (connectin) based passive force regulation has been an important physiological mechanism to adjust to varying muscle stretch conditions. Upon stretch, titin behaves as a spring capable of modulating its elastic response in accordance with changes in muscle biochemistry. One such mechanism has been the calcium-dependent stiffening of titin domains that renders the spring inherently more resistant to stretch. This transient titin-calcium interaction may serve a protective function in muscle, which could preclude costly unfolding of select domains when muscles elongate to great lengths. To test this idea, fluorescence spectroscopy was performed revealing a change in the microenvironment of the investigated immunoglobulin domain 27 (I27) of titin with calcium. Additionally, an atomic force microscope was used to evaluate the calcium-dependent regulation of passive force by stretching eight linked titin I27 domains until they unfolded. When stretching in the presence of calcium, the I27 homopolymer chain became stabilized, displaying three novel properties: (1) higher stretching forces were needed to unfold the domains, (2) the stiffness, measured as a persistence length (PL), increased and (3) the peak-to-peak distance between adjacent I27 domains increased. Furthermore, a peak order dependence became apparent for both force and PL, reflecting the importance of characterizing the dynamic unfolding history of a polymer with this approach. Together, this novel titin Ig-calcium interaction may serve to stabilize the I27 domain permitting titin to tune passive force within stretched muscle in a calcium-dependent manner.

The treatment regimen consisted of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 only, cytosine arabinoside 2,000 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 2, and pentoxifylline 400 mg orally three times daily beginning 7 to 14 days before the chemotherapy. The pentoxifylline was continued between chemotherapy cycles. Chemotherapy courses were repeated at 3-to 4-week intervals. Partial remissions were seen in two patients, two patients were stable, and five patients failed on treatment. Dose-limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia. Pentoxifylline itself caused some nausea and anorexia. Although the patient numbers were small, there was no indication that pentoxifylline increased the efficacy of this chemotherapy in head and neck cancer. It is possible that another dose schedule might have been more effective.	Carcinoma, Squamous Cell	drug therapy

Depolarizing pulses, given from a holding potential of about –100 mV, elicited a transient outward current when the membrane potential was made more positive than about –20 mV. As the potential was made increasingly positive the transient outward current first increased and then decreased. The amplitude of the transient current increased when the external Ca2+ concentration was raised; and the current was abolished by Mn2+. It appears that when the membrane is depolarized Ca2+ ions enter the oocyte and trigger an outward current, possibly by opening Cl– channels.	Calcium	physiology

Recent trials indicate that several new chemotherapy agents may be useful for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) refractory to, or recurring following platinum-based chemotherapy. Two phase III trials have established docetaxel as the first chemotherapeutic agent with proven benefit for patients with recurrent or refractory disease following initial chemotherapy. Several other new drugs including gemcitabine have been tested by phase II studies. Treatment with pemetrexed resulted in outcomes with clinically equivalent efficacy, but with significantly fewer side effects compared with docetaxel in two phase III trials. It should be considered a standard treatment option for second-line treatment when available. EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors including gefitinib and erlotinib have benefits as second-line chemotherapy for NSCLCs. Symptom relief, improvement of QOL, and minimum toxicity as well as survival benefit have to be evaluated in phase III trials in order to develop a new second-line chemotherapy.

DATA SOURCES The keywords “estrogen,” “estrogen replacement therapy,” or “hormone replacement therapy,” and “breast cancer” or “breast neoplasm,” were used to search for articles published from 1975–2000 in MEDLINE and Dialogweb. Only articles published in peer‐reviewed journals and containing original data were included in this review. METHODS Unadjusted or age‐adjusted risk estimates for breast cancer among ever users of estrogen therapy compared with never users were abstracted from published articles or calculated using the data provided in the published reports. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS We found little consistency among studies that estimated the risk of breast cancer in hormone users compared with nonusers and in studies assessing the risk by duration of use. However, there was consistently a lower risk of death from breast cancer in hormone users compared with nonusers. CONCLUSION The evidence did not support the hypotheses that estrogen use increases the risk of breast cancer and that combined hormone therapy increases the risk more than estrogen only. Additional observational studies are unlikely to alter this conclusion. Although a small increase in breast cancer risk with hormone therapy or an increased risk with long duration of use (15 years or more) cannot be ruled out, the likelihood of this must be small, given the large number of studies conducted to date.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Current cholesterol guidelines recommend the same prevention strategy for patients with DM alone as patients with DM + CKD. However, the incremental risk of these common complications for incident cardiovascular disease and mortality has not been well studied.


METHODS
We compared the incremental risk of having DM + CKD, DM + CVD and DM + CVD + CKD in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial participants for incident CVD as the primary outcome and all-cause mortality.


RESULTS
After a mean (SD) follow up of 4.7(1.4) years, 1,046(10%) participants developed CVD. DM +vCKD, DM + CVD, and DM + CKD + CVD had a significantly increased risk of the primary outcome compared to DM alone [adjusted hazard ratio(95%CI): 1.41 (1.06-1.89), p = 0.02; 2.20 (1.92-2.53), p < 0.001); 2.35 (1.81-3.04), p < 0.001), respectively]. All-cause mortality had a graded increased risk compared to the reference group [adjusted hazard ratio(95%CI): 1.39 (1.01-1.90), p = 0.04; 1.29 (1.51-2.12), p < 0.0001; 2.36 (1.75-3.13), p < 0.0001), respectively].


CONCLUSION
Our post hoc analysis shows an incremental graded risk for CVD outcomes and all-cause mortality with the development of CKD and/or CVD in individuals with DM."	Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2	mortality
78	225444294	3047442092	225444294	Tracking the dynamics of global and competitive inhibition in early and late adulthood: Evidence from the flanker task.	Inhibitory control is proposed to involve 2 dissociable processes that feature distinct types of inhibition: a threshold adjustment process involving the global inhibition of motor output and a controlled selection process involving competitive inhibition among coactive responses. Recent research with children and young adults indicates that the functioning of these processes can be targeted by measuring participants' hand movements as they perform inhibitory control tasks by reaching to touch response options on a digital display. The current study explores (a) whether this method can be used to target the functioning of the threshold adjustment process and controlled selection process in adults 65 to 75 years of age and, if so, (b) whether the functioning of each process changes between early and late adulthood. Results from the Eriksen flanker task indicate that reach tracking can be used to target the functioning of each process in late adulthood, with older adults and young adults generating similar patterns of initiation time and curvature effects. The congruency effect observed in response times was significantly larger in older adults than in young adults, indicating that inhibitory control declines in late adulthood. Importantly, this effect was specific to initiation times, suggesting that the threshold adjustment process functions differently in early adulthood than in late adulthood. These results present a new perspective on how age-related differences in inhibitory control are conceptualized and assessed, and raise important questions concerning how the threshold adjustment and controlled selection processes function across a wider range of tasks in late adulthood.

Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a common metabolic abnormality in children of all ages. There is evidence of an association of idiopathic hypercalciuria with nephrolithiasis, hematuria, and osteoporosis. However, much of this evidence is anecdotal and the precise role of hypercalciuria in the pathogenesis of these conditions is far from clear. Furthermore, the precise definition of idiopathic hypercalciuria has not yet been established. The methodologies for quantitating urinary calcium excretion have also not been standardized, adding another potential confounding factor to the accurate interpretation of urinary calcium excretion. Long-term studies on the natural history of unselected children with idiopathic hypercalciuria are needed to establish the true clinical significance of this condition. The focus of this review is to critically evaluate the methods currently being used to measure urinary calcium excretion in children and to assess the validity of existing criteria for diagnosing idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Due in part to scarcity of material, no published study has yet cladistically addressed the systematics of living and fossil Tenrecidae (Mammalia, Afrotheria). Using a noninvasive technique for sampling nuclear DNA from museum specimens, we investigate the evolution of the Tenrecidae and assess the extent to which tenrecids fit patterns of relationships proposed for other terrestrial mammals on Madagascar. Application of several tree-reconstruction techniques on sequences of the nuclear growth hormone receptor gene and morphological data for all recognized tenrecid genera supports monophyly of Malagasy tenrecids to the exclusion of the two living African genera. However, both parsimony and Bayesian methods favor a close relationship between fossil African tenrecs and the Malagasy Geogale, supporting the hypothesis of island paraphyly, but not polyphyly. More generally, the noninvasive extraction technique can be applied with minimal risk to rare/unique specimens and, by better utilizing museum collections for genetic work, can greatly mitigate field expenses and disturbance of natural populations.

Reagents which affect the cytosolic concentrations of protons and sodium ions markedly affect the degranulation process of mast cells. The proton-sodium exchanging ionophore, monensin, is found to cause noncytolytic dose dependent serotonin release from the rat leukemic basophils (line RBL-2H3). Its half maximal dose of ca. 2 microM leads to secretion of ca. 20% of these cells' serotonin content. Monensin induced serotonin secretion increases with external pH and decreases upon lowering external sodium ion concentrations, yet is independent on external calcium. Monitoring cytosolic pH and free Ca2+ concentrations with BCECF and quin2, respectively, shows that a rise in pHi and [Ca2+]i is caused by the ionophore. Amiloride, the blocker of cellular Na+/H+ antiporter, is found to be an effective inhibitor of antigen or monensin induced serotonin release. However, it does not by itself cause secretion. In contrast, ouabain, which inhibits the cellular Na+/K+ ATPase, does induce secretion. Cellular levels of pH, Na+ and Ca2+ ions are evidently linked and involve a manifold of activities. Though exchanging protons for sodium seems to be effective in causing mediator release, the present results do not provide sufficient support for proton/sodium ions having a second messenger role in the immunologically induced mediator release.

Fluorescent antibody technics were used to determine the localization and distribution of Schistosoma mansoni antigen in tissue cells, the presence of circulating antibody, and the sites of antibody production or in vivo antigen-antibody combination. The experiments were performed in mice after a primary infection with cercariae, after several challenges, and after antigen stimulation and challenge. Evidence of the presence of circulating antibody was first observed at 20 days in the inhibition fluorescent antibody test, at 25 days in the indirect fluorescent antibody test, at 42 days with the cercarial fluorescent antibody test, and at 47 days in the Cercarienhullen reaction.
Sites of antibody production or in vivo antigen-antibody combination were observed in inflammatory cells of the portal tracts, especially those along the smaller arteries, and in granulomas and isolated cells in the parenchyma of the liver; in the perivascular tissue cells, isolated parenchymal cells and granulomas of the lungs; and in cells in the center of the follicles and of perivascular infiltration in the spleen and lymph nodes.
The sites of antigen deposition after a single exposure were the perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and histiocytes in the parenchyma of the liver and lungs, the granulomas of the liver, and the neutrophils in the sinuses and the perivascular cells in the spleen. In the reexposed and antigen-stimulated groups, the same areas were positive for antigen, and in addition, antigen was detected in the endothelium of the blood vessels in the lung and some cells in the lymph nodes."

Single, fast glycolytic skeletal muscle fibres were isolated from wild‐type (MyoD+/+) and MyoD mutant mice (MyoD‐/‐), which lack a functional copy of the MyoD gene. Fibres were chemically permeabilized to permit manipulation and control of the ionic environment of the otherwise intact myofilament apparatus. 2. Results show a fivefold greater variability in the [Ca2+] required for half‐maximum tension generation among individual MyoD‐/‐ fibres in comparison with controls (p < 0.05). 3. Consistent with this finding, Western blot analysis showed a sevenfold greater variability in the isoform expression pattern of the thin filament regulatory protein troponin T in Myod‐/‐ compared with control fibres (p < 0.05). 4. Electrophoretic analysis of single‐fibre segments indicated no apparent alteration in the isoform expression pattern of other regulatory and contractile proteins. In addition, other parameters of contractile function, including velocity of unloaded shortening, and maximum force production, were not significantly different between MyoD‐/‐ and MyoD ø fibres. 5. These findings indicate that the thin filament structure‐ function relationship is altered due to the MyoD mutation and suggest that MyoD plays a role in establishing and/or maintaining the differentiated phenotype of adult fast skeletal muscle fibres.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the frequency, cost, patient-level risk factors, and hospital-level variation in 30-day readmissions following sepsis compared with congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. Design:A retrospective cohort analysis of hospitalizations from 2009 to 2011. Setting:All acute care, nonfederal hospitals in California. Patients:Hospitalizations for sepsis (n = 240,198), congestive heart failure (n = 193,153), and acute myocardial infarction (n = 105,684) identified by administrative discharge codes. Interventions:None. Measurements and Main Results:The primary outcomes were the frequency and cost of all-cause 30-day readmissions following hospitalization for sepsis compared with congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. Variability in predicted readmission rates between hospitals was calculated using mixed-effects logistic regression analysis. The all-cause 30-day readmission rates were 20.4%, 23.6%, and 17.7% for sepsis, congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction, respectively. The estimated annual costs of 30-day readmissions in the state of California during the study period were $500 million/yr for sepsis, $229 million/yr for congestive heart failure, and $142 million/yr for acute myocardial infarction. The risk- and reliability-adjusted readmission rates across hospitals ranged from 11.0% to 39.8% (median, 19.9%; interquartile range, 16.1–26.0%) for sepsis, 11.3% to 38.4% (median, 22.9%; interquartile range, 19.2–26.6%) for congestive heart failure, and 3.6% to 40.8% (median, 17.0%; interquartile range, 12.2–20.0%) for acute myocardial infarction. Patient-level factors associated with higher odds of 30-day readmission following sepsis included younger age, male gender, Black or Native American race, a higher burden of medical comorbidities, urban residence, and lower income. Conclusion:Sepsis is a leading contributor to excess healthcare costs due to hospital readmissions. Interventions at clinical and policy levels should prioritize identifying effective strategies to reduce sepsis readmissions.	Myocardial Infarction	economics

Adaptive responses associated with environmental stressors are critical to cell survival. Under conditions when cellular redox and antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed, the selective oxidation of critical methionines within selected protein sensors functions to down-regulate energy metabolism and the further generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, these functional changes within protein sensors take advantage of the helix-breaking character of methionine sulfoxide. The sensitivity of several calcium regulatory proteins to oxidative modification provides cellular sensors that link oxidative stress to cellular response and recovery. Calmodulin (CaM) is one such critical calcium regulatory protein, which is functionally sensitive to methionine oxidation. Helix destabilization resulting from the oxidation of either Met(144) or Met(145) results in the nonproductive association between CaM and target proteins. The ability of oxidized CaM to stabilize its target proteins in an inhibited state with an affinity similar to that of native (unoxidized) CaM permits this central regulatory protein to function as a cellular rheostat that down-regulates energy metabolism in response to oxidative stress. Likewise, oxidation of a methionine within a critical switch region of the regulatory protein phospholamban is expected to destabilize the phosphorylation-dependent helix formation necessary for the release of enzyme inhibition, resulting in a down-regulation of the Ca-ATPase in response to beta-adrenergic signaling in the heart. We suggest that under acute conditions, such as inflammation or ischemia, these types of mechanisms ensure minimal nonspecific cellular damage, allowing for rapid restoration of cellular function through repair of oxidized methionines by methionine sulfoxide reductases and degradation pathways after restoration of normal cellular redox conditions.

Previous exploratory factor analyses (EFA) of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) have yielded highly disparate factor structures, while the few reported confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of this instrument have been more consistent. The present study employed a CFA approach to identify the factor structure of the WMS-R in a mixed clinical sample of 306 patients, the majority of whom had sustained mild, diffuse brain injury. Consistent with previous CFA studies, the present study found that a three-factor solution (attention/concentration, immediate memory, delayed recall) fit the data significantly better than competing models. The validity of separate verbal and visual memory indices was not supported, perhaps because of the heterogeneity of the sample.	Mental Disorders	psychology

In Drosophila, neuroblasts divide asymmetrically along the apical–basal axis shortly after their delamination from the neuroectodermal epithelium. Several proteins, including Numb and Miranda, segregate into the basal daughter cell and are needed for the determination of its correct cell fate. Both the apical–basal orientation of the mitotic spindle and the localization of Numb and Miranda to the basal cell cortex are directed by Inscuteable, a protein that localizes to the apical cell cortex before and during neuroblast mitosis. Here we show that the apical localizaton of Inscuteable requires Bazooka, a protein containing a PDZ domain that is essential for apical–basal polarity in epithelial cells. Bazooka localizes with Inscuteable in neuroblasts and binds to the Inscuteable localization domain in vitro and in vivo. In embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic bazooka function, Inscuteable no longer localizes asymmetrically in neuroblasts and is instead uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. Mitotic spindles in neuroblasts are misoriented in these embryos, and the proteins Numb and Miranda fail to localize asymmetrically in metaphase. Our results suggest that direct binding to Bazooka mediates the asymmetric localization of Inscuteable and connects the asymmetric division of neuroblasts to the axis of epithelial apical–basal polarity.

90	22780950	2067886767	22780950	Negative pressure wound therapy for cervical esophageal perforation with abscess.	Perforation of the cervical esophagus is a rare but life-threatening condition. Cervical esophageal perforation with abscess formation can be usually treated with conservative treatments of simple drainage and antibiotics. Aggressive surgical treatments are considered if conservative treatments fail. But the aggressive treatments have low success rate and high morbidity in cervical esophageal perforation. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was widely used in various complicated wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, open abdomen, pressure ulcers, open fractures, sterna wounds, grafts, and flaps since it had been introduced in 1997. NPWT is known to be a valuable tool in the management of various complicated wounds. In this report, we described a case of intractable cervical esophageal perforation with abscess, which was successfully treated with NPWT after the failure of conservative management.

91	36536554	2023508376	36536554	Fine structure of hepatic sinusoids and sinusoidal cells in disease.	Liver sinusoids are special capillaries that are limited by fenestrated endothelial cells, without a genuine basement membrane, surrounded by perisinusoidal cells storing vitamin A, and harbouring Kupffer cells and pit cells, resident macrophages, and large granular lymphocytes, respectively. Each nonparenchymal cell and parenchymal cell of the liver interacts with all others and with the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the functional ability of each cell is constantly being modified by the metabolic activity of the others. Human liver biopsies (132), needle or surgical, perfusion-fixed with glutaraldehyde and processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and occasionally for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were examined. The study included liver diseases (such as alcoholic liver diseases, benign and malignant liver tumors, cholestasis of various origins, fulminant hepatitis, acute rejection after orthotopic liver transplantation, Budd-Chiari syndrome), as well as general or extrahepatic diseases (such as diabetes, hemochromatosis, hypervitaminosis A, various hematological disorders), and normal controls. Ultrastructural abnormalities are described and illustrated under two different headings: 1) elementary lesions of sinusoidal cells (endothelial, Kupffer, perisinusoidal and pit cells), nonsinusoidal cells (in the space of Disse and/or in the lumen), the extracellular matrix; and 2) the major pathological entities including perisinusoidal fibrosis, capillarization of sinusoids, sinusoidal dilatation, and peliosis. In the discussion, an overview of the major abnormalities reported in the literature is presented, and some specific questions regarding 1) perisinusoidal fibrosis in liver with normal histology, 2) the overload of perisinusoidal cells with lipids in non-hypervitaminosis A intoxication and 3) the etiological relationship of sinusoidal dilatation, peliosis, perisinusoidal fibrosis, or sinusoidal tumors with drugs and toxic compounds are discussed. In the event that lesions are not specific to any diagnosis, the knowledge of the ultrastructure of sinusoids is extremely useful from the perspective of the liver as an ecosystem.	Liver	blood supply

To assess an effect of the combined use of Cytoflavin and Sulodexide on the course and outcomes of purulent meningitis in children.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty children with purulent meningitis, aged from 5 to 17 years 11 month, were studied. Thirty patients of the treatment group (n=30; mean age 6,8 ± 2,2 years) received Cytoflavin (0,6 mcg/kg once a day) during 5 days with the following treatment with Sulodexide (250 LSU/day in children 5-12 years, 500 LSU/day in children above 12 years). Patients of the comparison group (n=20), aged 5,9±1,8 years, received standard antibacterial treatment. Duration and persistent of fever, cerebral, meningeal symptoms, the recovery period of CSF, the normalization of the number of desquamated epithelial cells (DEC), D-dimer were estimated. Outcomes of purulent meningitis were assessed using a working scale representing a modification of Rankin's, Fisher's, and Glasgow scales.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The combination of drugs reduces the duration of cerebral and meningeal symptoms, leads to the normalization of hematological parameters (the level of leukocytes, desquamous epithelial cells, D-dimer) and improves outcomes."	Anti-Bacterial Agents	therapeutic use

Many studies have suggested the feasibility and safety of early oral nutrition after gastrectomy; however, the tolerability of early oral nutrition has rarely been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the tolerability of early oral nutrition and factors affecting early oral nutrition failure after gastrectomy.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed 565 patients with gastric cancer who had undergone gastrectomy and who had received oral nutrition on postoperative day 1. Failure of early oral nutrition was defined as cessation of at least one meal for any reason. Preoperative clinical information and operative factors were analyzed concerning an association with early oral nutrition failure.


RESULTS
The tolerability of early oral nutrition after gastrectomy was 74.7%. Of 565 patients, 72 (12.7%) failed early oral nutrition due to adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, 52 (9.2%) failed due to gastric stasis or ileus, and 19 (3.4%) patients failed due to other postoperative complications. In the univariate analysis, age (≥70 years), male sex, preoperative tumor obstruction, remnant stomach cancer, open surgery, operating time (≥4 h), and an advanced preoperative stage were associated with failed early oral nutrition. Multivariable analysis of these factors revealed that male sex, preoperative tumor obstruction, operating time, and advanced preoperative stage were independent predictive factors for early oral nutrition failure after gastrectomy.


CONCLUSIONS
The tolerability of early oral nutrition after gastrectomy was comparable to that of other gastrointestinal surgeries. A tailored approach for postoperative oral nutrition is required based on identified risk factors for early oral nutrition failure."	Postoperative Complications	rehabilitation

The neuroprotective potential of halothane anesthesia was investigated following unilateral electrolytic lesions to the forelimb representation area of the sensorimotor cortex (FL-SMC). Previously, it was found that the FL-SMC lesion increases substantially in size when the intact forelimb is immobilized with a plaster of paris cast for the first 7 days postlesion, which forces extreme overuse of the impaired forelimb during a time when nonlethally damaged tissue is vulnerable to behavioral demand. Initially, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether intracisternal infusion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2), a potent neurotrophic factor that has been shown to have neuroprotective and plasticity promoting properties in focal stroke and other injury models, could prevent this use-dependent exaggeration of injury. Although intracisternal bFGF (starting 24 h after surgery, twice per week) was not found to produce significant neuroprotective or behavioral effects, the brief exposure to halothane anesthesia (15-20 min) during bFGF or vehicle administration was found to prevent expansion of the lesion size, and to reduce delayed loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). The data have implications for investigations of the effects of neurotrophic factor in vivo, and other investigations requiring brief, intermittent halothane anesthesia.	Brain	pathology
95	41977657	2045995052	41977657	Combination of gastrin-releasing peptide antagonist with cytotoxic agents produces synergistic inhibition of growth of human experimental colon cancers	We investigated the efficacy of a powerful antagonist of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (BN/GRP) RC-3940-II administered as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents on the growth of HT-29, HCT-116 and HCT-15 human colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. GRP-receptor mRNA and protein were found in all three cell lines tested. Exposure of HT-29 cells to 10 μM RC-3940-II led to an increase in the number of cells blocked in S phase and G2/M and cells with lower G0/G1 DNA content. Similar changes on the cell cycle traverse of HT-29 cells could also be seen at lower concentrations of RC-3940-II (1 μM) after pretreatment with 100 nM GRP (14–27), indicating a dose-dependent mechanism of action based on the blockage of BN/GRP induced proliferation of tumor cells at lower concentrations. Daily in vivo treatment with BN/GRP antagonist RC-3940-II decreased the volume of HT-29, HCT-116 and HCT-15 tumors xenografted into athymic nude mice by 25 to 67% (p < 0.005). Combined treatment with RC-3940-II and chemotherapeutic agents 5-FU and irinotecan resulted in a synergistic tumor growth suppression of HT-29, HCT-116 and HCT-15 xenografts by 43% to 78%. In HT-29 and HCT-116 xenografts the inhibition for the combinations of RC-3940-II and irinotecan vs. single substances (p < 0.05) was significantly greater. These findings support the use of RC-3940-II as an anticancer agent and may help to design clinical trials using RC-3940-II in combinations with cytotoxic agents.

Mortality rates for specific cancer types and age-sex groups computed for large numbers of cities typically show extreme fluctuation. This is primarily due to the rare occurrence of specific cancer deaths in most of the small and moderate size cities during a fixed time period. Assuming a Poisson death process, we use an empirical Bayes method to obtain adjusted rates that are more stable for comparison of cities and prediction of future mortality. We have chosen stomach and bladder cancers in Missouri cities to illustrate the problems, techniques and results.	Neoplasms	mortality
97	28811939	1602635175	28811939	c-myc overexpression activates alternative pathways for intracellular proteolysis in lymphoma cells	Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is a highly malignant B-cell tumour characterized by chromosomal translocations that constitutively activate the c-myc oncogene. Here we show that BL cells are resistant to apoptosis and do not accumulate ubiquitin conjugates in response to otherwise toxic doses of inhibitors of the proteasome. Deubiquitinating enzymes and the cytosolic subtilisin-like protease tripeptidylpeptidase II are upregulated in BLs, and could be rapidly induced by the overexpression of c-myc in normal B cells carrying oestrogen-driven recombinant Epstein–Barr virus. Apoptosis was induced by inhibiting tripeptidylpeptidase II, suggesting that the activity of this protease may be required for the survival of BL cells. We thus show that there is a regulatory link between c-myc activation and changes in proteolysis that may affect malignant transformation.	Proteins	metabolism
98	15270497	2090738436	15270497	Modulation of single channels underlying hippocampal L-type current enhancement by agonists depends on the permeant ion.	The influx of calcium (Ca(2+)) ions through L-type channels underlies many cellular processes, ranging from initiation of gene transcription to activation of Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels. L-type channels possess a diagnostic pharmacology, being enhanced by the dihydropyridine BAY K 8644 and benzoylpyrrole FPL 64176. It is assumed that the action of these compounds is independent of the ion conducted through the channel. In contrast to this assumption, modulation of L-type channel activity in acutely dissociated rat CA1 hippocampal neurons depended on the divalent ion identity. BAY K 8644 and FPL 64176 substantially increased single-channel open time only when barium (Ba(2+)) was the permeant ion. BAY K 8644 increased single-channel conductance when either Ba(2+) or Ca(2+) ions were the charge carrier, an effect not observed with FPL 64176. BAY K 8644 enhanced the whole cell L-type channel Ca(2+)- or Ba(2+)-carried current without a change in deactivation tail kinetics. In contrast, enhancement by FPL 64176 was associated with a dramatic slowing of deactivation kinetics only when Ba(2+) and not Ca(2+) was the charge carrier. Current activation was slowed by FPL 64176 with either charge carrier, an effect arising from a clustering of agonist-modified long-duration openings toward the end of the voltage step. These data indicate that agonists enhanced L-type current by distinct mechanisms dependent on the permeant ion, indicating that care must be considered when used as diagnostic tools.

99	33009703	2082139731	33009703	Mechanisms of the combined effect of asbestos and smoking in the etiology of lung cancer.	The joint effects of exposure to two known lung carcinogens, tobacco smoking and asbestos, are reviewed. The variable pattern of interaction--ranging from supramultiplicative to less than additive--may reflect the fact that both asbestos and smoking are complex carcinogens which can affect more than one stage of lung carcinogenesis. The joint effect of two such agents will depend on the relative magnitude of the effects at each stage. The epidemiologic evidence from studies of insulation workers with high exposures suggests an interaction that approximates the multiplicative model, indicating that each of the two factors has an independent action on the multistage process of carcinogenesis. Very limited information is available on the interaction between these two agents in causing specific histological types of lung cancer. Both tobacco smoke and asbestos fibers can be genotoxic and cytotoxic and cause proliferative lesions in the lungs. Tobacco smoke is known to contain carcinogens that bind to critical genes in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and cause mutations. Asbestos fibers may cause chronic inflammation of the lungs, which releases various cytokines and growth factors, and therefore may provide a possible selective growth advantage for mutated cells.

100	19494961	2035764748	19494961	City structure, obesity, and environmental justice: an integrated analysis of physical and social barriers to walkable streets and park access.	Local parks and walkable neighborhoods are commonly cited as elements of the urban environment that promote physical activity and reduce obesity risk. When those vulnerable to obesity-related diseases live in neighborhoods without these qualities, it works against environmental justice goals that aim for a fair distribution of amenities. We use geographic information systems (GIS) to evaluate the relationship between the distribution of populations vulnerable to obesity and proximity to parks and walkable street networks in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Though previous studies have used GIS to assess the distribution of access to opportunities for physical activity, none have analyzed access to both parks and walkable resources at once. Neither have they included data that reflects findings on a smaller scale indicating that perceptions of resource quality, safety, and cultural relevance also affect physical activity levels. We include these safety and quality factors in our study through statistical data on traffic fatalities, crime rates and park size. We find that, counter to predictions, subpopulations generally considered vulnerable to obesity (and environmental injustices more generally) are more likely to live in walkable neighborhoods and have better walking access to neighborhood parks than other groups in Phoenix. However, crime is highest in walkable neighborhoods with large Latino/a and African-American populations and parks are smaller in areas populated by Latino/as. Given the higher prevalence of obesity and related diseases in lower income and minority populations in Phoenix, the results suggest that benefits of built environments may be offset by social characteristics. Our most consistent finding indicates a strong negative relationship between the percentage of the population under 18 years of age living in an area and the likelihood that the structure of the built environment supports physical activity. Children under 18 are significantly underrepresented in regions deemed highly walkable and those with access to parks.	Obesity	ethnology

Ca2+ current and tension have been simultaneously recorded from single twitch fibres of the semi-tendinosus of Rana esculenta in a medium containing a physiological Ca2+ concentration (1.8 mM). Under appropriate conditions it can be shown that tension develops in two phases. The first is rapid and reaches its maximum before activation of the inward Ca2+ current. The second phase is slower and with a time course which appears to be correlated with that of the inward current. Nifedipine, a specific Ca2+ channel inhibitor greatly reduced ICa2+ and the slower component of tension. Bay K8644 a Ca2+ channel activator, which has receptors on T-tubule, increased ICa2+ and the slow component of tension. These results indicate that a slow component of skeletal muscle contraction is related to the inward Ca2+ current flowing through dihydropyridine sensitive voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.

102	3353813	2566842452	3353813	TM6SF2 rs58542926 impacts lipid processing in liver and small intestine	The transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) loss‐of‐function variant rs58542926 is a genetic risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and progression to fibrosis but is paradoxically associated with lower levels of hepatically derived triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins. TM6SF2 is expressed predominantly in liver and small intestine, sites for triglyceride‐rich lipoprotein biogenesis and export. In light of this, we hypothesized that TM6SF2 may exhibit analogous effects on both liver and intestine lipid homeostasis. To test this, we genotyped rs58542926 in 983 bariatric surgery patients from the Geisinger Medical Center for Nutrition and Weight Management, Geisinger Health System, in Pennsylvania and from 3,556 study participants enrolled in the Amish Complex Disease Research Program. Although these two cohorts have different metabolic profiles, carriers in both cohorts had improved fasting lipid profiles. Importantly, following a high‐fat challenge, carriers in the Amish Complex Disease Research Program cohort exhibited significantly lower postprandial serum triglycerides, suggestive of a role for TM6SF2 in the small intestine. To gain further insight into this putative role, effects of TM6SF2 deficiency were studied in a zebrafish model and in cultured human Caco‐2 enterocytes. In both systems TM6SF2 deficiency resulted in defects in small intestine metabolism in response to dietary lipids, including significantly increased lipid accumulation, decreased lipid clearance, and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conclusions: These data strongly support a role of TM6SF2 in the regulation of postprandial lipemia, potentially through a similar function for TM6SF2 in the lipidation and/or export of both hepatically and intestinally derived triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins.

This is usually to the bone, lungs and brain. Other unusual metastatic presentations such as skin and bowel metastasis have also been described. In most cases, the metastasis occurs as a late manifestation in a patient with known primary renal cell carcinoma. A rare synchronous presentation of skin and duodenal metastasis in an otherwise asymptomatic patient is reported here. This patient presented with a skin lesion that, on excision, brought up the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. While the patient was waiting for surgery, she also developed melena that, on gastroscopy, confirmed a duodenal metastasis. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of otherwise unrelated lesions as presentations for an advanced renal malignancy.	Skin Neoplasms	secondary

Extraordinary progress made in analysis of common variation with GWAS methodology does not provide sufficient resolution to understand rare variation. To fulfill missing classification for rare germline variation we assembled dataset of whole exome sequences from>2000 patients (selected cases tested negative for candidate genes and unselected cases) with different types of cancers (breast cancer, colon cancer, and cutaneous and ocular melanomas) matched to more than 7000 non-cancer controls and analyzed germline variation in known cancer predisposing genes to identify common properties of disease-associated DNA variation and aid the future searches for new cancer susceptibility genes. Cancer predisposing genes were divided into non-overlapping classes according to the mode of inheritance of the related cancer syndrome or known tumor suppressor activity. Out of all classes only genes linked to dominant syndromes presented significant rare germline variants enrichment in cases. Separate analysis of protein-truncating and missense variation in this list of genes confirmed significant prevalence of protein-truncating variants in cases only in loss-of-function tolerant genes (pLI < 0.1), while ultra-rare missense variants were significantly overrepresented in cases only in constrained genes (pLI > 0.9). In addition to findings in genetically enriched cases, we observed significant burden of rare variation in unselected cases, suggesting substantial role of inherited variation even in relatively late cancer manifestation. Taken together, our findings provide reference for distribution and types of DNA variation underlying inherited predisposition to some common cancer types.	Neoplasms	genetics
105	5810765	2055687981	5810765	Function of the ING family of PHD proteins in cancer.	The ING genes encode a family of at least seven proteins with conserved plant homeodomain (PHD)-type zinc fingers in their C-termini. The founding member, ING1, is capable of binding to and affecting the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and factor acetyltransferase (FAT) protein complexes. Some ING proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation of genes, such as the p53-inducible genes p21 and Bax. Others have been found to affect post-translational modifications, exemplified by the ING2-induced acetylation of p53 on the same site deacetylated by the Sir2 HDAC. Upon UV irradiation, ING1 causes cell cycle arrest and interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen to promote DNA repair or induce apoptosis in cells to prevent tumorigenesis depending upon the severity of DNA damage. It is very likely that, by linking DNA repair, apoptosis and chromatin remodeling to the transcriptional regulation of critical genes, ING1 exerts it tumor suppressor functions by helping maintain genomic stability. Therefore, ING proteins, which are down-regulated in a broad variety of cancer types, are able to restrict cell growth and proliferation, induce apoptosis, and modulate cell cycle progression, which strongly supports the notion that ING family proteins act as class II tumor suppressors.

107	15060774	2155380261	15060774	A Biophysical Approach to Predicting Protein–DNA Binding Energetics	Sequence-specific interactions between proteins and DNA play a central role in DNA replication, repair, recombination, and control of gene expression. These interactions can be studied in vitro using microfluidics, protein-binding microarrays (PBMs), and other high-throughput techniques. Here we develop a biophysical approach to predicting protein–DNA binding specificities from high-throughput in vitro data. Our algorithm, called BindSter, can model alternative DNA-binding modes and multiple protein species competing for access to DNA, while rigorously taking into account all sterically allowed configurations of DNA-bound factors. BindSter can be used with a hierarchy of protein–DNA interaction models of increasing complexity, including contributions of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and longer words to the total protein–DNA binding energy. We observe that the quality of BindSter predictions does not change significantly as some of the energy parameters vary over a sizable range. To take this degeneracy into account, we have developed a graphical representation of parameter uncertainties called IntervalLogo. We find that our simplest model, in which each nucleotide in the binding site is treated independently, performs better than previous biophysical approaches. The extensions of this model, in which contributions of longer words are also considered, result in further improvements, underscoring the importance of higher-order effects in protein–DNA energetics. In contrast, we find little evidence of multiple binding modes for the transcription factors (TFs) and experimental conditions in our data set. Furthermore, there is limited consistency in predictions for the same TF based on microfluidics and PBM data.	DNA	metabolism

Sensing dielectric property differences of tissues over a wide frequency band has been made possible by ultra-wideband (UWB) techniques. In this paper, a flexible, compact monopole antenna on a 100 μm Kapton polyimide is designed, using a high frequency structure simulator (HFSS), to be in contact with biological breast tissues over the 2-5GHz frequency range. The antenna parameters are optimized to obtain a good impedance match over the required frequency range. The designed antenna size is 18mm × 18mm. Further, a flexible conformal 4×4 ultra-wideband antenna array, in a format similar to that of a bra, was developed for a radar-based breast cancer detection system.	Breast Neoplasms	diagnosis

All extracellular concentrations were adjusted to explore ranges that are clinically achievable in human serum upon conventional therapy. In broth, ampicillin, meropenem, and azithromycin were only bacteriostatic, whereas gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin were strongly bactericidal in a concentration-dependent manner. In cells, ampicillin, meropenem, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin were slightly bactericidal (0.3- to 0.8-log CFU reductions), moxifloxacin was strongly bactericidal (2.1-log CFU reduction), and gentamicin was virtually inactive. The difference in the efficacies of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin in cells did not result from a difference in levels of accumulation in cells (6.96 ± 1.05 versus 7.75 ± 1.03) and was only partially explainable by the difference in the MICs (0.58 ± 0.04 versus 1.40 ± 0.17 mg/liter). Further analysis showed that intracellular moxifloxacin expressed only approximately 1/7 of the activity demonstrated against extracellular bacteria and ciprofloxacin expressed only 1/15 of the activity demonstrated against extracellular bacteria. Gentamicin did not increase the intracellular activities of the other antibiotics tested. The data suggest (i) that moxifloxacin could be of potential interest for eradication of the intracellular forms of L. monocytogenes, (ii) that the cellular accumulation of an antibiotic is not the only determinant of its intracellular activity (for fluoroquinolones, it is actually a self-defeating process as far as activity is concerned), and (iii) that pharmacodynamics (activity-to-concentration relationships) need to be considered for the establishment of efficacy against intracellular bacteria, just as they are for the establishment of efficacy against extracellular infections.

We collected resting-state brain functional magnetic resonance imaging and standardized verbal recall tests from 42 older adults with AMD and 41 age-matched controls. We used seed-based whole brain analysis to quantify the strength of functional connectivity between hubs of the default mode network and a network of medial temporal regions relevant for memory. Our results indicated neither memory performance nor network connectivity differed by AMD status. However, the AMD participants exhibited stronger relationships than the controls between memory performance and connectivity from the memory network hub (left parahippocampal) to 2 other regions: the left temporal pole and the right superior/middle frontal gyri. Also, the connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex of default mode network correlated more strongly with memory performance in AMD compared to control. We concluded that stronger brain-behavior correlation in AMD may suggest a role for region-specific connectivity in supporting memory in the context of AMD.	Brain	physiopathology

The aim of our study was to validate this risk categorization in European early breast cancer patients. We retrospectively analyzed frozen breast cancer specimens of 352 Dutch patients with histologically confirmed primary invasive early breast cancer. CDK-based risk was determined in tumour tissues by calculating a risk score (RS) according to kinases activity and protein mass concentration assay without the knowledge of outcome. Determination of CDK-based risk was feasible in 184 out of 352 (52%) tumours. Median follow-up of these patients was 15 years. In patients not receiving systemic treatment, the proportions of risk categories were 44% low, 16% intermediate, and 40% high CDK-based risk. These groups remained significant after univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. Factors associated with a shorter distant recurrence-free period were positive lymph nodes, mastectomy with radiotherapy, and high CDK-based risk. There was no significant correlation with overall survival (OS). CDK-based risk is a prognostic marker of distance recurrence of patients with early breast cancer. More validation would be warranted to use of CDK-based risk into clinical practice.	Breast Neoplasms	enzymology

We herein report the case of a diabetic man with critical limb ischemia, who after lower-extremity revascularization with a prosthetic graft, developed an early graft infection due to Gram-negative and fungal organisms, and who was successfully treated with a covered stent placed across grossly infected tissues. A discussion on the pertinent literature is also offered.	Anti-Bacterial Agents	administration & dosage
113	41419781	2163996024	41419781	Manganese-dependent regulation of the endocarditis-associated virulence factor EfaA of Enterococcus faecalis.	There is increasing recognition of the emerging role of manganese regulation and acquisition in some pathogenic bacteria. Expression of the Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis-associated virulence factor EfaA is induced by growth in serum. It is demonstrated here that expression of the efaCBA operon encoding a putative ABC-type transporter is regulated by Mn(2+). Transcription of efaCBA and EfaA production were repressed in Mn(2+)-supplemented medium. A Mn(2+)-responsive transcriptional regulator, EfaR, sharing 27 % identity with the Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR), was identified. In the presence of Mn(2+), EfaR protein bound in vitro to the efaC promoter region. Analysis of the E. faecalis V583 genome revealed ten additional putative EfaR-binding sites, suggesting that manganese availability could have a broader regulatory role in infection. The results identify a new Mn(2+)-sensing regulator in enterococci that regulates the expression of a virulence factor implicated in enterococcal endocarditis.	Bacterial Proteins	biosynthesis

Although influenza vaccination is recommended for children with asthma, only a minority are vaccinated. One reason for low influenza vaccine coverage among children with asthma may be concern that influenza vaccination may induce an exacerbation of asthma.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the safety of influenza vaccination in children with asthma, we studied the incidence of hospitalizations and emergency department visits for asthma following influenza vaccination.


DESIGN
Retrospective cohort study-analysis of population-based computerized medical and vaccination records.


SETTING
: Four large health maintenance organizations on the West Coast of the United States.


SUBJECTS
Children with asthma 1 through 6 years of age, identified by search of computerized databases of medical encounters and pharmacy prescriptions.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Exacerbations of asthma.


RESULTS
In unadjusted analyses vaccination was associated with high rates of asthma exacerbations. However, after adjusting for asthma severity using a self-control method, the incidence rate ratios of asthma exacerbations after vaccination were 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.95), 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.47-1.17), and 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.27) during the 3 influenza seasons.


CONCLUSIONS
After controlling for asthma severity, we found that influenza vaccination does not result in acute asthma exacerbations in children. Concern about possible exacerbation of asthma is not a valid reason to not vaccinate children with asthma against influenza."	Asthma	physiopathology

To investigate the mechanisms contributing to penem resistance, we used the laboratory strain PAO1 to construct a series of isogenic mutants with an impaired multidrug efflux system MexAB-OprM and/or impaired chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase. The outer membrane barrier of PAO1 was partially eliminated by inducing the expression of the plasmid-encodedEscherichia coli major porin OmpF. Susceptibility tests using the mutants and the OmpF expression plasmid showed that MexAB-OprM and the outer membrane barrier, but not AmpC β-lactamase, are the main mechanisms involved in the high intrinsic penem resistance of PAO1. However, reducing the high intrinsic penem resistance of PAO1 to the same level as that of penem-susceptible gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli required the loss of either both MexAB-OprM and AmpC β-lactamase or both MexAB-OprM and the outer membrane barrier. Competition experiments for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) revealed that the affinity of PBP 1b and PBP 2 for faropenem were about 1.8- and 1.5-fold lower, than the respective affinity for imipenem. Loss of the outer membrane barrier, MexAB, and AmpC β-lactamase increased the susceptibility of PAO1 to almost all penems tested compared to the susceptibility of the AmpC-deficient PAO1 mutants to imipenem. Thus, it is suggested that the high intrinsic penem resistance of P. aeruginosa is generated from the interplay among the outer membrane barrier, the active efflux system, and AmpC β-lactamase but not from the lower affinity of PBPs for penems.

The protective action of CRN against the toxic effects of MTZ is not accompanied by a reduction of the antitumour activity of MTZ; on the contrary the reduced toxicity permits higher doses of MTZ to be given with the result that better antitumour activity can be achieved. This is illustrated by the highly effective action of MTZ and CRN in preventing the appearance of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) metastases, a tumour against which MTZ when used alone is inactive even at maximum tolerated doses (MTD). However, the effect of the combination on the primary 3LL is less pronounced.HD-MTZ and CRN are also more effective than MTD-MTZ alone in preventing dissemination and proliferation of L1210 leukaemia.Although the mechanism of the CRN protective effect is as yet unclear it appears that CRN prevents the lethal effects of necrotizing enteritis produced by HD-MTZ.It is concluded that CRN by reducing MTZ toxicity without interfering with its activity increases the therapeutic index of MTZ and permits an expanded exploration of its dose response curve against a variety of malignancies.

Regular physical exercise can help prevent non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes, as well as many other common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis (1). Researchers and clinicians are now facing the challenge of motivating inactive people to become physically active (2). Several campaigns designed to promote greater levels of participation in physical activity have been described (3). A walking campaign was a part of the Stockholm Diabetes Prevention Program (SDPP) (4); the intervention phase of the program being directed at three of the major risk factors for the development of the disease: physical inactivity, poor dietary habits, and obesity. The campaign was conducted during eight weeks in 1997 in the municipality of Upplands VaÈsby, a suburban area with a population of approximately 36,000 inhabitants in Stockholm County. There are ®ve well-de®ned residential areas in the municipality with great potential for walking tours in the neighbourhood. Promotion of the campaign was organized through the Diabetes Prevention Unit in Stockholm County by the local health promotion authority, ``Healthy VaÈsby''. The strategy used, intervention within the community, made it possible to address smaller subgroups of the population in settings such as residential areas. The local health promotion authority and the local health planner, together with a local sports organization, were responsible for planning, setting up, and managing the campaign. The objectives of the campaign were to offer the inhabitants access to physical activity in their neighbourhood and to study whether locally recruited voluntary leaders could meet the challenge to lead walking groups. In this study we wanted to engage the local population, both as leaders for the physical activities and as participants in the walking tours. Recruitment of walking leaders as volunteers was done through advertising in the local newspaper about three months prior to the campaign. The recruited volunteers were given a short education by a physiotherapist in leadership, practice, and ®rst aid. After ful®lling the con®rmed criteria and demonstrating practical attainments the volunteers were awarded a diploma. The campaign and the schedule for the organized walks were advertised in the local newspaper and through posters put up at central places in the community during the three weeks before the start. Residents were offered the walking tours free of charge in ®ve residential areas with easily reached walking tracks. One or two volunteers met with the participants at special meeting places ®ve days a week, and on 169 occasions for walks of about 45 min duration. Evaluation of exercise campaigns has generally relied on self-reported activity data. In this study a combination of self-reported data and direct observation of exercise behaviour were used.

118	9546868	2415325417	9546868	The spectrum of left main coronary artery disease: variables affecting patient selection, management, and death.	A total of 178 patients having a diagnosis of left main coronary artery stenosis were divided into three groups as follows: surgical, Group I (n = 135 patients); operable medically treated, Group II (n = 21 patients); and inoperable, Group III (n = 22 patients). Groups 1 and 2 were comparable with regard to clinical profile, extent of anatomic coronary disease, and left ventricular function. Inoperable patients had a much higher incidence of prior myocardial infarction (especially anterior), more severe distal coronary disease, and markedly depressed left ventricular function. The hospital mortality rate for surgical patients was 4% (6/135). The late mortality rate, (median follow-up = 23.4 months) was 7% (9/135). For operable patients, the late mortality rate was 43% (9/21) at 28 months. In the inoperable group, the late death rate at 20 months was 59% (13/22). Actuarial survival at 24 months for the three groups was: 88%, 66%, and 42%, respectively. Of the nine patients who died in the operable group, two had less than 75% obstruction of the left main coronary artery and two had normal left ventricular wall motion. Although patients with higher grades of left main coronary artery stenosis and reduced left ventricular function are at greater risk, patients with less obstruction and good left ventricular function are also at risk and should have myocardial revascularization with some sense of urgency. The population of left main coronary artery stenosis is a heterogeneous one, and comparison of surgical versus medical therapy should exclude inoperable patients. The operative mortality rate has been greatly reduced in recent years (2% in the last 100 cases); this is attributed to careful monitoring in the critical prebypass period, aggressive pharmacologic treatment of increased preload, tachycardia, and hypertension, and improved aurgical technique, with emphasis on careful myocardial preservation. Adherence to these principles makes frequent use of the intra-aortic balloon either before or after revascularization unnecessary.	Postoperative Complications	mortality

Prostacyclin (PGI2) administered icv into the lateral rat brain ventricle in a dose of 1 and 10 micrograms caused hypothermia and catalepsy. Joint administration of PGI2 and chlorpromazine produced a greater cataleptic effect than that observed after the neuroleptic alone. Cimetidine (CMT) 2 g/kg po administered 60 min before PGI2 icv injection inhibited hypothermic and cataleptogenic action of PGI2. CMT blocked the cataleptogenic effect of chlorpromazine as well as combination of it with PGI2. CMT inhibited cataleptogenic effect of haloperidol, but it did not block the catalepsy induced by joint administration of haloperidol and PGI2. PGI2 did not change concentration of noradrenaline and dopamine in different brain areas. The results indicate that H2 receptors take part in some central pharmacological effects of PGI2 in rats.

This microorganism is widely used in the manufacture of fermented meats and has biotechnological potential in biopreservation and food safety. We have explored the 1,884,661-base-pair (bp) circular chromosome of strain 23K encoding 1,883 predicted genes. Genome sequencing revealed a specialized metabolic repertoire, including purine nucleoside scavenging that may contribute to an ability to successfully compete on raw meat products. Many genes appear responsible for robustness during the rigors of food processing – particularly resilience against changing redox and oxygen levels. Genes potentially responsible for biofilm formation and cellular aggregation that may assist the organism to colonize meat surfaces were also identified. This genome project is an initial step for investigating new biotechnological approaches to meat and fish processing and for exploring fundamental aspects of bacterial adaptation to these specific environments.

Although cervical cancer screening by cytology is successful, the test continues to show relatively poor operating characteristics. Cell cycle markers may enhance detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the clinical usefulness of ProExC, an immunocytochemical assay for cell cycle components, performed on routine cervical cytology samples.


DESIGN
Cervical cytology samples were collected using the SurePath method. Residual cells remaining after preparation of the Papanicolaou-stained slide were used to make a second slide for ProExC staining using an indirect polymer-based immunoperoxidase method. Only adequately cellular slides were evaluated for the presence of nuclear staining within cytologically abnormal epithelial cells. Results were correlated with clinical follow-up.


RESULTS
Six hundred twenty-four samples were satisfactorily cellular and stained. Correlation with clinical follow-up for subsequent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ on biopsy/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on cytology (CIN 2+/HSIL) showed that 434 results were true negative, 78 true positive, 18 false-negative, and 94 false-positive, resulting in a sensitivity/specificity of 81%/82%. When ProExC results were combined with any level of cytologic atypia, sensitivity for CIN 2+/HSIL was 92% and specificity was 84%.


CONCLUSIONS
ProExC shows promise as an aid in enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of cervical cytology for subsequent CIN 2+/HSIL and may be useful in identifying those cervical lesions most apt to progress."	Carcinoma, Squamous Cell	diagnosis

Urokinase plasminogen activator (UK-PA) is a serine protease implicated in cancer invasion and metastasis. In this investigation, patients with breast cancers containing high levels of UK-PA antigen had significantly higher risk of early disease recurrence and shorter overall survival than did patients with low levels of the protein. In univariate analysis, UK-PA was a more powerful discriminator for disease-free interval than axillary node status, tumor size, or estradiol receptor. For overall survival, UK-PA as a prognostic marker, was of similar magnitude to axillary node status but stronger than that of tumor size or estradiol receptor. In multivariate analysis, for both disease-free interval and survival, UK-PA was an independent risk factor, being independent of tumor size, axillary node status, and estradiol receptor. UK-PA appears to be a new and independent prognostic marker in breast cancer.	Breast Neoplasms	metabolism

Invasive fungal infections are a major complication and an important cause of morbidity and mortality among solid organ transplant recipients. Their diagnosis is difficult and their prognosis is often pejorative.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to report the cases of invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipients in Habib Bourguiba Sfax university hospital and to identify the main fungal agents.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
It is a retrospective study of invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipient reported in our hospital from January 1995 to February 2013.


RESULTS
Invasive fungal infections were diagnosed in 11 cases (3.4%) among 321 renal transplant recipients. These infections included four cases of pneumocystosis, two cases of candidiasis, two cases of aspergillosis, two cases of cryptococcosis and one case of mucormycosis. There were six men and five women. The mean age was 37 years. The infection was late in 63% of cases (>3 months after transplantation). The prolonged corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy were the main risk factors (100%) followed by renal failure (45%), graft rejection (45%), broad spectrum antibiotics (45%), CMV infection (36%), neutropenia (36%) and dialysis (18%). The evolution under treatment was favourable only in two cases (18%).


CONCLUSION
Invasive fungal infections are not common among kidney transplant recipients. However, they remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. Prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate management are necessary to improve prognosis and reduce mortality rate."	Postoperative Complications	epidemiology

Material for cytologic smears was obtained from pulmonary lesions in 146 patients at the Ohio State University between 1979 and 1984 using Rotex or Lee screw needles. Corresponding histologic specimens were available for comparison in 77 of these cases. Diagnoses of malignant neoplasms made by cytologic evaluation (55 cases) were confirmed by the corresponding histologic specimens in 93% of those cases. Possible explanations for the cytologic false-positive diagnoses of malignancy are presented. Correlations between the cytologic and histologic diagnoses of the morphologic type of tumor were 100% for adenocarcinoma, 75% for squamous-cell carcinoma and 20% for large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. The correlation was 100% for small-cell carcinoma when the histology specimen represented the tumor. Nonneoplastic benign lesions diagnosed cytologically had corresponding benign histologic diagnoses in 94% of the cases. These results compare favorably with those reported for other fine needle aspiration studies of pulmonary lesions. The advantages of using Rotex needles as compared to fine needle aspiration are discussed.	Lung Neoplasms	pathology

Prognostic influences of hepatic transection by an anterior approach using the liver hanging maneuver (LHM) has not been fully clarified.


METHODS
We examined 233 patients who underwent major hepatectomy with the LHM (n = 75; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 35, colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) in 10, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in 14 and perihilar bile duct carcinoma (BDC) in 16) or without it (n = 158; HCC in 78, CLM in 21, ICC in 31 and BDC in 28).


RESULTS
In HCC patients, cancer-positive margin rate, blood loss, transection time and prevalence of posthepatectomy ascites in the LHM group were significantly lower than those in the non-LHM group (p < 0.05). In CLM, transection time in the LHM group was significantly lower than that in the non-LHM group (p < 0.05). In BDC patients, amount of blood loss, transection time and prevalence of ascites in the LHM group were significantly lower than those in the non-LHM group (p < 0.05). In CLM patients, tumor recurrence rate in the non-LHM group was significantly higher than that in the LHM group and disease-free survival in the LHM group was significantly better than that in the non-LHM group in CLM patients and, however, this difference was not observed in a large CLM exceeding 5 cm. However, significant differences of posthepatectomy disease-free and overall survivals were not observed in HCC, ICC and BDC patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Although advantages of LHM improving surgical records in major anatomical liver resections were clarified, oncological advantages in the long-term survival of LHM was still uncertain in the hepatobiliary malignancies."	Liver Neoplasms	surgery

Because monitoring the changes in Cu level of organs has been proposed to follow the evolution of the disease, we analyzed the copper isotopic composition of serum and brain of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice, a model of Alzheimer’s disease, and wild-type (WT) controls. Serum composition of 3, 6, 9 and 12-month-old mice, as well as the composition of 9 brains of 12-month-old mice are reported. In WT mice, brains were ~1‰ isotopically heavier than serum, and the Cu isotopic composition of the serum was isotopically different between males and females. We propose that this effect of sex on the Cu isotopic budget of the serum may be related to a difference of Cu speciation and relative abundance of Cu carriers. Brains of APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice were slightly lighter than brains of WT mice, while not statistically significant. This trend may reflect an increase of Cu(I) associated with the formation of Aβ fibrils. The Cu isotopic composition of the brains and serum were correlated, implying copper transport between these two reservoirs, in particular a transfer of Cu(I) from the brain to the serum. Altogether, these data suggest that Cu stable isotopic composition of body fluid may have the potential to be used as detection tools for the formation of Aβ fibrils in the brain, but further work has to be done.

Publisher Summary The involvement of glutamine in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, glucosamine 6-phosphate, and p -aminobenzoic acid, and in the formation of all the amino acids makes this metabolite a key intermediate in the synthesis of important end products such as proteins, nucleic acids, and complex polysaccharides. The enzyme of Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria has been widely studied and appears to possess an extraordinary capability to integrate quite different metabolic signals and react appropriately. The E. coli glutamine synthetase (GS) is regulated at least by four different regulatory mechanisms, including repression of its synthesis, cumulative feedback inhibition by several end products of glutamine metabolism, modulation by the divalent metal ions, and covalent modification. With the aim of verifying in vivo the exceptional capability of GS to answer with an appropriate’ catalytic potency and regulatory susceptibility to different microenvironmental conditions, a method has been devised to study the GS cascade system in situ . E.coli can be made permeable to low molecular weight compounds while retaining GS and its cascade components by treating the cells with the nonionic detergent.	Escherichia coli	enzymology

Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DPH) refers to an uncommon but significant condition of bleeding into the alveolar space. Anemia and hemoptysis are important clinical features, but they may be absent. Although the radiographic and computed tomography findings are often varied and nonspecific, the imaging manifestations of pulmonary hemorrhage and the associated findings in the thorax often provide important diagnostic information that may lead to a specific diagnosis. DPH significantly influences patient management and has important prognostic implications. This review article explores the imaging findings in DPH and its differential diagnosis, highlighting important clues to this diagnosis and to its underlying etiology. DPH is an uncommon condition characterized by bleeding into the alveolar space that, when recognized on imaging, provides important diagnostic and prognostic information.	Lung	diagnostic imaging
133	45954924	2147988814	45954924	Experts debate message sent by increased cancer survival rates.	"Three new federal reports say that the number of cancer cases in the United States has reached a new high, and more people are alive after a diagnosis of cancer than ever before. These reports, the first to specifically focus on cancer survivorship, suggest that there has been marked progress in the treatment of cancer and that a more comprehensive research and clinical focus is needed for post-treatment care of survivors. Among the findings: The number of people living with cancer increased from 3 million in 1971 to 9.8 million in 2001, and 5-year survival of adult cancer has increased from 50% to 64% within that rough time frame. Changes in 5-year survival rates were even greater in childhood cancer: 79% in 2001 compared with 56% three decades ago. But some experts question whether the data reflect widespread treatment success in adults, saying that the numbers are inflated by increased detection of nonlethal cancers by screening and that they provide no information on quality of life— longstanding objections that the authors say they understand and are working to further refine. Others raise the question of whether the survival statistics are an accurate measure of treatment success. Nevertheless, the numbers send a message about where survivorship research should be focused. "" The number of people diagnosed with cancer and still living is large and continuing to increase, "" said Michael Thun, M.D., chief epidemiologist for the American Cancer Society. "" And these recent reports make a convincing case that survivorship programs are needed to support these individuals. "" Key Findings The three reports were issued within weeks of each other. The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was published in the journal Cancer on July 1 and contained a special section on survival trends; a report on cancer survivorship in 1971–2000 was published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on June 25; and "" Living Beyond Cancer: Finding a New Balance , "" was issued by the President's Cancer Panel in early June. All of the reports used data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Cancer mortality information was collected by states and consolidated in a national database by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Repetitive displacements of the hair bundle towards the kinocilium (positive stimulation 7°, 300 ms, 2Hz for 10 s), revealed [Ca2+]i variations detectable only in the cuticular plate. [Ca2+]i increased from 105 to 145 nM. Single mechanical displacements of the hair bundle (7°, 200 ms, 0.5Hz) evoked increases of [Ca2+]ifrom 50±23 nM to 139±79 (n=12). In the opposite direction, the mechanical stimulations (8°, 400ms, 0.5Hz) evoked a decrease of [Ca2+]i from 68±17 nM to 37±12 nM (n= 8). The variations of [Ca2+]i detected in the cuticular plate during positive displacements of the hair bundle were reversibly abolished in the presence of 100 μM gentamicin and they could not be evoked in 0.1 mM calcium in the external medium. From these experiments, it has been concluded that the [Ca2+]i variations recorded in the cuticular plate were due to a limited entry of calcium ions through transduction channels localized in the hair bundle. The typical kinetics of variations of [Ca2+]i evoked during positive displacements of the hair bundle should account for the presence of strong calcium regulation systems in the hair bundle and cuticular plate.

This study aimed at the development of improved drugs against human osteosarcoma, which is the most common primary bone tumor in children and teenagers with a low prognosis available treatment. New insights into the impact of an unconventional Pd(II) anticancer agent on human osteosarcoma cells were obtained by synchrotron-based infrared microspectroscopy (SR-microFTIR) and quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments from its effect on the cellular metabolism to its influence on intracellular water which can be regarded as a potential secondary pharmacological target. Specific infrared biomarkers of drug action were identified, enabling a molecular-level description of variations in cellular biochemistry upon drug exposure. The main changes were detected on the protein and lipid cellular components, namely on the ration of unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acids. QENS revealed a reduced water mobility within the cytoplasm for drug-treated cells, coupled to a disruption of the hydration layers of biomolecules. Additionally, the chemical and dynamical profiles of osteoscarcoma cells were compared to metastatic breast cancer, revealing distinct dissimilarities that may influence drug activity.

It was found that the Mauthner fibre synthesizes proteins in the absence of cell nuclei. Amino acid incorporation showed sensitivity to puromycin and to acetoxycycloheximide but resistance to chloramphenicol. Only slight inhibition was caused by actinomycin‐D. The contribution of the denuded axon to the total protein synthesis was about 30 per cent per unit length Mauthner fibre. The remaining activity was due to the myelin sheath compartment. Fractionation experiments showed that the incorporation in the sheath was due to components other than the myelin lamellae. The subcellular distribution of newly synthesized proteins in the isolated and incubated Mauthner fibre was compared to that found in the incubated spinal cord. The results strongly suggested the existence in the Mauthner fibre of a primary microsomal, rather than a mitochondrial, protein synthesizing system.	Neurons	metabolism
138	18224820	2137553317	18224820	A geographical information system-based analysis of cancer mortality and population exposure to coal mining activities in West Virginia, United States of America.	"Cancer incidence and mortality rates are high in West Virginia compared to the rest of the United States of America. Previous research has suggested that exposure to activities of the coal mining industry may contribute to elevated cancer mortality, although exposure measures have been limited. This study tests alternative specifications of exposure to mining activity to determine whether a measure based on location of mines, processing plants, coal slurry impoundments and underground slurry injection sites relative to population levels is superior to a previously-reported measure of exposure based on tons mined at the county level, in the prediction of age-adjusted cancer mortality rates. To this end, we utilize two geographical information system (GIS) techniques--exploratory spatial data analysis and inverse distance mapping--to construct new statistical analyses. Total, respiratory and ""other"" age-adjusted cancer mortality rates in West Virginia were found to be more highly associated with the GIS-exposure measure than the tonnage measure, before and after statistical control for smoking rates. The superior performance of the GIS measure, based on where people in the state live relative to mining activity, suggests that activities of the industry contribute to cancer mortality. Further confirmation of observed phenomena is necessary with person-level studies, but the results add to the body of evidence that coal mining poses environmental risks to population health in West Virginia."

139	25231318	2138010881	25231318	PIK3CA mutation is an oncogenic aberration at advanced stages of oral squamous cell carcinoma	Phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinases (PI3K) are a group of heterodimeric lipid kinases that regulate many cellular processes. Gene amplification and somatic mutations mainly within the helical (exon 9) and kinase (exon 20) domains of PIK3CA, which encode the 110‐kDa catalytic subunit of PI3K and are mapped to 3q26, have been reported in various human cancers. Herein, 14 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines and 108 primary OSCC tumors were investigated for activating mutations at exons 9 and 20 as well as amplifications in PIK3CA. PIK3CA missense mutations in exons 9 and 20 were identified in 21.4% (3/14) of OSCC cell lines and 7.4% (8/108) of OSCC tumors by genomic DNA sequencing. An increase in the copy number of PIK3CA, although small, was detected in 57.1% (8/14) of OSCC lines and 16.7% (18/108) of OSCC tumors using quantitative real‐time PCR. A significant correlation between somatic mutations of PIK3CA and disease stage was observed: the frequency of mutations was higher in stage IV (16.1%, 5/31) than in a subset of early stages (stages I–III) (3.9%, 3/77; P = 0.042, Fisher's extract test). In contrast, the amplification of PIK3CA was observed at a similar frequency among all stages. AKT was highly phosphorylated in OSCC cell lines with PIK3CA mutations compared to those without mutations, despite the amplification. The results suggest that somatic mutations of the PIK3CA gene are likely to occur late in the development of OSCC, and play a crucial role through the PI3K–AKT signaling pathway in cancer progression.

140	20563527	1993723167	20563527	Thrombin-induced force development in vascular endothelial cells: contribution to alteration of permeability mediated by calcium-dependent and -independent pathways.	Endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction is associated with many types of vascular diseases. Investigators have hypothesized that altered EC contraction in conjunction with morphological changes may lead to EC dysfunction. However, the nature of EC contraction and its regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study we measured thrombin-induced force in bovine arterial EC force using EC fibers that were grown in a collagen matrix. Contraction, which occurred in time- and dose-dependent fashion, was elicited by thrombin. The thrombin-enhanced EC layer permeability was correlated with EC fiber contraction. These results suggest that EC contractile response is involved in alteration of EC barrier function. During the initial period of thrombin stimulation, cadherin complexes were disrupted and cell-to-cell connections were reduced. This was dependent on the transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration and myosin phosphorylation. Rho kinase activation led to rearrangement of actin stress fibers (ASF). Paracellular holes were created in the EC layer in parallel to EC morphological change. Our findings suggest that EC layer permeability is regulated by two distinguishable steps. In the initial period, the cell-to-cell connection was reduced in a calcium-dependent fashion. Subsequently, Rho kinase and ASF-mediated force development increased EC layer permeability via morphological change of EC.	Calcium	physiology

Summary Antisera against human tumors and tissues were used to analyze the antigenic composition of approximately 40 surgical specimens of normal and neoplastic tissues and five human tumors grown in rats and hamsters. It was found that, of the four reference antigens studied, one occurred in all and two in the majority of the surgical specimens, whereas a fourth antigen was present in only 50 per cent of the cases. All human tumors grown in foreign hosts lacked two or more of the reference antigens; one tumor lacked three of the antigens, and two tumors lacked all four.	Neoplasms	immunology

The effects of a prostacyclin analog OP-41483 on energy metabolism were studied in an isolated porcine liver perfused with human blood for 8 h. OP-41483 was administered intravenously at a rate of 0.3 microgram/kg/min during the procurement and into the perfusate at a rate of 1.0 microgram/min during perfusion. Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and pyruvate were measured before perfusion and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 h after perfusion, from which values the ketone body ration (acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate, KBR), reflecting the redox state of liver mitochondria, was calculated. In the OP-41483 group, KBR increased rapidly from 0.34 to 0.95, 1.61, 1.51, 2.35, and 2.04, and lactate decreased rapidly from 9.81 to 6.30, 4.51, 3.22, 2.39, and 1.33 mmol/L at the respective hours after perfusion. There were significant differences after 3 h of perfusion as compared with the control group (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that administration of OP-41483 causes an increase in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio (oxidized and reduced forms of free nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides), leading to an enhancement of the metabolic capacity of the perfused liver.

145	23745249	1995777900	23745249	Mechanism of rapid phosphate (Pi) transport adaptation to a single low Pi meal in rat renal brush border membrane	Previous studies have shown that the adaptive response of tubular inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport to Pi deprivation is detectable in the whole kidney 24 h after switching rats from a high (HPD) to a low (LPD) Pi diet. In the present work we report on a more rapid adaptive response of the sodium (Na)-dependent Pi transport system located in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule and its relation with changes in phosphatemia an parathyroid hormone status. Rats were fed HPD and trained to eat their daily ration within 1 h. After two weeks of equilibration half of the animals received a single LPD ration. 1, 2 and 4 h after the end of food consumption the animals were either sacrificed for renal cortical brush border membrane vesicle (BBMV) isolation or used for determining plasma Pi concentration, urinary excretion of Pi and cAMP. The results indicate that 2 and 4 h after the end of feeding, the Na-dependent Pi transport in BBMV was stimulated by 70 and 140% respectively in intact rats exposed for the first time to LPD. This response was preceded by a significant fall in plasma Pi concentration (HPD: 2.46±0.03, LPD: 2.04±0.05 mM), in the urinary excretion of Pi (HPD: 899.0±68.1; LPD: 6.5±3.3 μmol/ml GFR) and cAMP (HPD: 76.9±7.4, LPD: 48.2±1.4 pmol/ml GF). This last result suggested a rapid inhibition of PTH after one single LPD feeding. In thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats the Na-dependent Pi transport system was also stimulated 4 h after LPD, but to a slightly less extent than in intact rats.In conclusion, the Na-dependent Pi transport located in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule reacts within hours to dietary Pi restriction. This specific tubular response coupled with the hypophosphatemia should account for the rapid decrease in urinary Pi excretion. Although the adaptive response at the BBMV level is also expressed in TPTX rats, inhibition of the PTH-cAMP system could contribute to the rapid adaptation observed in intact animals.

Mechanisms that underlie aging and pathogenesis in specific brain circuits have been particularly elusive. However, animal models have been exploited in studies related to normative and pathogenic aging. Traditional transgenic animals represent permanent germ-line alterations in gene expression; changes that are present during development, remain indefinitely and likely invoke compensatory changes in the animal. In contrast, conditional transgenic animals combined with somatic gene delivery afford precise temporal and spatial gene regulation. In this review, we will detail current somatic mosaic approaches to study networks involved in the recognition, interpretation and recall of spatial representations, the septohippocampal pathway. We will also highlight potential uses for this approach in Alzheimer's disease, a complex pathophysiological state involving changes in many cellular pathways.	Brain	pathology

Chronic increase of mineralocorticoids obtained by administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) results in salt-dependent hypertension in animals. Despite the lack of a generalized sympathoexcitation, DOCA-salt hypertension has been also associated to overdrive of peripheral nervous system in organs typically targeted by blood pressure (BP), as kidneys and vasculature. Aim of this study was to explore whether DOCA-salt recruits immune system by overactivating sympathetic nervous system in lymphoid organs and whether this is relevant for hypertension.


Methods and results
To evaluate the role of the neurosplenic sympathetic drive in DOCA-salt hypertension, we challenged splenectomized mice or mice with left coeliac ganglionectomy with DOCA-salt, observing that they were both unable to increase BP. Then, we evaluated by immunofluorescence and ELISA levels of the placental growth factor (PlGF) upon DOCA-salt challenge, which significantly increased the growth factor expression, but only in the presence of an intact neurosplenic sympathetic drive. When PlGF KO mice were subjected to DOCA-salt, they were significantly protected from the increased BP observed in WT mice under same experimental conditions. In addition, absence of PlGF hampered DOCA-salt mediated T cells co-stimulation and their consequent deployment towards kidneys where they infiltrated tissue and provoked end-organ damage.


Conclusion
Overall, our study demonstrates that DOCA-salt requires an intact sympathetic drive to the spleen for priming of immunity and consequent BP increase. The coupling of nervous system and immune cells activation in the splenic marginal zone is established through a sympathetic-mediated PlGF release, suggesting that this pathway could be a valid therapeutic target for hypertension."

In this work, we evaluate the stability of a new freeze-dried and albumin-free formulation of recombinant human IFN alpha 2b (rhIFN-alpha2b) to be used in humans. The freeze-dried, albumin-free formulation was stored at the recommended temperature of 4 degrees C, and under accelerated storage conditions (28 degrees C). The stability of this product was also compared with the stability of a liquid albumin-free formulation of this cytokine. Finally, the stability of the freeze-dried albumin-free formulation was examined after reconstitution and storage at 4 degrees C and room temperature (28 degrees C) for 30 days. Samples were periodically subjected to biological activity assay (antiviral titration), reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), pyrogens, sterility and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing, abnormal toxicity screening, organoleptic evaluation, and measurement of residual moisture and pH. Accelerated storage (28 degrees C) data for the freeze-dried albumin-free formulation showed biochemical stability of the active ingredient throughout the 6-month study, showing activity between 85 and 125% of its nominal value. RP-HPLC-determined purity showed that rhIFN-alpha2b remained above 95%. Additionally, the formulation was non-pyrogenic, non-toxic, sterile, and organoleptically acceptable. The real-time storage data confirmed the good biochemical long-term (30 months) stability of the freeze-dried formulation of this cytokine. Comparison with the liquid rhIFN-alpha2b albumin-free preparation showed that the freeze-dried albumin-free formulation maintained the stability of the active ingredient better than the liquid preparation. The formulation was also stable after reconstitution and storage at 4 degrees C and 28 degrees C, for 30 days.	Antineoplastic Agents	chemistry
149	22519903	2162006440	22519903	Angiogenesis and hypertension: an update	The purpose of this review is to provide a basic understanding of the important relationship between microvascular remodelling, angiogenesis and hypertension, that is, provide an overview of recent experimental and clinical evidence from anti-hypertensive and pro- and anti-angiogenic therapy with respect to hypertension and microvascular structure. Microvascular rarefaction, that is, a loss of terminal arterioles and capillaries, is found in most forms of human and experimental arterial hypertension. This further increases peripheral resistance, and aggravates hypertension and hypertension-induced target organ damage. In some cases with a genetic predisposition, hypertension is preceded by a loss of microvessels. Therefore, new therapies aimed at reversing microvascular rarefaction potentially represent candidate treatments of hypertension. The microvasculature is formed by the continuous balance between de novo angiogenesis and microvascular regression. Imbalanced angiogenesis, in addition to functional shut-off of blood flow, contributes to microvascular rarefaction. Numerous clinical trials assessing anti-angiogenic agents in cancer patients show that this therapy leads to microvascular rarefaction and causes or aggravates hypertension. The development of specific pro-angiogenic treatment to correct hypertension or ischaemic disorders, however, it is still in its infancy. On the other hand, long-term treatment by classic anti-hypertensive therapies that present vasodilator activity can correct for hypertension-associated rarefaction in man.

In a disease-oriented phase II study, 26 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were treated with oral VP-16-213 at 120 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 3 weeks. Of 24 evaluable patients, 3 achieved partial remission (PR) for 12, 16 and 35 weeks respectively. Minor regression or stabilization of the disease (NC) was achieved in 8 patients for a median duration of15 weeks. Patients with PR and NC experienced similar median survival (22 weeks), whereas non-responders had a median survival of less than8 weeks. Results of this trial indicate that VP-16-213 has limited but definite anti-tumor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Liver Neoplasms	drug therapy

They play important biological roles and are implicated in pathology. Even so, proteins recognizing these structures are largely undefined. Using affinity purification with the S9.6 antibody coupled to mass spectrometry, we defined the RNA/DNA hybrid interactome in HeLa cells. This consists of known R-loop-associated factors SRSF1, FACT, and Top1, and yet uncharacterized interactors, including helicases, RNA processing, DNA repair, and chromatin factors. We validate specific examples of these interactors and characterize their involvement in R-loop biology. A top candidate DHX9 helicase promotes R-loop suppression and transcriptional termination. DHX9 interacts with PARP1, and both proteins prevent R-loop-associated DNA damage. DHX9 and other interactome helicases are overexpressed in cancer, linking R-loop-mediated DNA damage and disease. Our RNA/DNA hybrid interactome provides a powerful resource to study R-loop biology in health and disease.	DNA	metabolism

In order to analyze this high-level induction of IFN-gamma in these bacterium-treated mice, we investigated the factors that might be involved. An activity that induces IFN-gamma in T cells was observed in the liver extracts of mice treated with P. acnes and subsequently challenged with lipopolysaccharide. Here, we purified an IFN-gamma-inducing factor from the liver extract to homogeneity and characterized it. Its molecular mass was 18 to 19 kDa, and its pI was 4.9. The amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal portion was determined and shown to have no similarities to any protein in the EMBL, GenBank, and PIR data bases. The same molecule was also demonstrated in the serum factor that was previously reported to have an IFN-gamma-inducing activity and to have an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. Moreover, the activity of this serum factor was recovered in the fraction containing the 18- to 19-kDa protein under reducing conditions and was shown to have the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence as that of the factor from the liver extract. In addition to the ability to induce IFN-gamma, this protein augmented T-cell proliferation and NK activity in the spleen cells. Thus, several of its biological activities were apparently similar to those of interleukin-12. These results indicated that this novel protein, which exhibited marked costimulatory activity on IFN-gamma production in vitro, was elevated vivo in response to P. acnes treatment. This factor, probably released from the producing cells by lipopolysaccharide stimuli, may be involved in the high-level induction of IFN-gamma in the P. acnes-treated mice.	Liver	metabolism
153	49882253	2884691340	49882253	FerA is a Membrane-Associating Four-Helix Bundle Domain in the Ferlin Family of Membrane-Fusion Proteins	Ferlin proteins participate in such diverse biological events as vesicle fusion in C. elegans, fusion of myoblast membranes to form myotubes, Ca2+-sensing during exocytosis in the hair cells of the inner ear, and Ca2+-dependent membrane repair in skeletal muscle cells. Ferlins are Ca2+-dependent, phospholipid-binding, multi-C2 domain-containing proteins with a single transmembrane helix that spans a vesicle membrane. The overall domain composition of the ferlins resembles the proteins involved in exocytosis; therefore, it is thought that they participate in membrane fusion at some level. But if ferlins do fuse membranes, then they are distinct from other known fusion proteins. Here we show that the central FerA domain from dysferlin, myoferlin, and otoferlin is a novel four-helix bundle fold with its own Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding activity. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), spectroscopic, and thermodynamic analysis of the dysferlin, myoferlin, and otoferlin FerA domains, in addition to clinically-defined dysferlin FerA mutations, suggests that the FerA domain interacts with the membrane and that this interaction is enhanced by the presence of Ca2+.

First, within a few years, physicians could have a way to monitor brain function at the bedsideofhospitalizedinfants,somethingthat is not currently possible with large functional magneticresonanceimaging(fMRI)machines. European researchers have developed a portable brain scanning technology called functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI). The fUSI system employs a flexible, noninvasive head mount and combines videoelectroencephalographic recording with ultrafast Doppler (UfD) imaging of brain microvasculature. The researchers previously developed the UfD technology, which produces up to 10 000 images per second, compared with 50 images per second in conventional ultrasound, enabling detection of small vessels or low blood flow in neonates. The variations in blood volume during the recordings are correlated with neuronal activity and could provide information on neonatal brain function in conditions such as hemodynamic failure, congenital heart defects, and sepsis, said Olivier Baud, MD, PhD, who co-led the development of fUSI while working at Robert Debré Children’s Hospital in Paris. In a proof-of-concept study in Science Translational Medicine, the investigators demonstrated fUSI’s ability to visualize cerebral bloodvolumechangesinresponsetochanges in brain activity during sleep states and seizures in neonates. Further study is needed on the safety of brain ultrasound scanning over long exposure times, the researchers said. Also on the horizon is a next-generation MRI scanner that can zoom in on brain regions as small as a poppy seed—a 20-fold increase in spatial resolution compared with current machines. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, will build a prototype machine over the next 2 years with a recently announced $13.43 million Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative grant from the National Institutes of Health. The new technology, dubbed MR Corticography (MRCoG), will advance fMRI and diffusion imaging of cortical layers delineating distinct populations of neurons. “Each cortical layer is a part of specific circuitry,” explained principal investigator David Feinberg, MD, PhD, adjunct professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley and president of Advanced MRI Technologies. “Therefore, the new scanner is designed to identify neuronal circuitry abnormalities for earlier and more specific diagnosis of abnormal brain conditions such as epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, Alzheimer disease, chronic pain, and psychiatric disorders.” The gain in resolution comes from a combination of innovations including a larger number of smaller receiver coils, higherperformance gradient coils, faster imaging pulse sequences, and reduced noise in image reconstruction. “ B y a c h i e v i n g a r e s o l u t i o n t h a t approaches the size of fundamental organizational units of the human cortex, we will be able to study the cortical neural circuitry def ining the communications between cortical layers and columns,” Feinberg said. “This will help close the gap between our understanding of neural activity at the cellular levels and human behavior and cognition.”	Brain	diagnostic imaging
155	28453095	1997586620	28453095	The physician's condition versus the patient's in deciding hospitalization.	I Kenneth Gayer's Open Forum comments on en teria for admission to inpatient care in general hos pitals (April 1973) were a delight to read. Our tradi tional indiscriminate use of hospitalization for the control of patients who worry or annoy us could not have been better or more succinctly contested than by this highly rational statement of what a hospital is really for. However, he left almost unmentioned the conditions under which the stated criteria for hospitalization can be used. I don't blame Dr. Gayer for this, because it was not the point his article emphasized. But in order to reserve hospital care for the rather narrow patient categories he recommends, it is necessary that nonhos pital alternative facilities and programs be available. Day treatment and halfway house programs, in par ticular, have been regarded by hospital-oriented psy chiatnists as merely transitional services, comparable to convalescent homes in which the patient may regain his coping strengths after completing his â€œ? real treat mentâ€•in the hospital. For Dr. Gayer's criteria for hos pital care to be at all realistic, these nonhospital al ternative facilities must be geared to the intensive treatment of the severely disturbed patient whose med ical and social circumstances do not dictate hospital ization under such criteria. I would only add that a hospital, in addition to pro viding a very expensive modality of care, conveys im plicitly to the patient the message that he is â€œ? sick,â€• and is to be brought around by the ministrations of the various healers he encounters there. I believe it to be philosophically and psychologically advantageous to avoid these implicit communications whenever pos sible, and to stress instead the patient's strengths and responsibilities for his own behavior. That is a goal far more readily reached in nonmedical facilities than in the tightly structured, healer-oriented institutions	Mental Disorders	therapy

We speculated that the small size of these DNA nanoparticles may facilitate gene transfer in postmitotic cells, permitting nuclear uptake across the 25-nm nuclear membrane pore. To determine whether DNA nanoparticles can transfect nondividing cells, growth-arrested neuroblastoma and hepatoma cells were transfected with DNA/liposome mixtures encoding luciferase. In both models, growth-arrested cells were robustly transfected by compacted DNA (6,900–360-fold more than naked DNA). To evaluate mechanisms responsible for enhanced transfection, HuH-7 cells were microinjected with naked or compacted plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein. Cytoplasmic microinjection of DNA nanoparticles generated a ∼10-fold improvement in transgene expression as compared with naked DNA; this enhancement was reversed by the nuclear pore inhibitor, wheat germ agglutinin. To determine the upper size limit for gene transfer, DNA nanoparticles of various sizes were microinjected into the cytoplasm. A marked decrease in transgene expression was observed as the minor ellipsoidal diameter approached 25 nm. In summary, suitably sized DNA nanoparticles productively transfect growth arrested cells by traversing the nuclear membrane pore.	DNA	metabolism

In hemodialysis (HD) patients, NAFLD may be a novel risk factor for their high cardiovascular mortality. Heightened oxidative stress is highly prevalent in HD patients. However, the relationship between oxidative stress and NAFLD in HD patients is not well defined. Methods We studied seventy-one stable nondiabetic HD patients. Nineteen patients had the diagnosis of NAFLD by ultrasonography. Blood levels of oxidative stress markers were measured in each patient, including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), free thiols, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. The copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in peripheral leukocytes were also determined. Demographic, biochemistry, and hemogram data were recorded. The two groups of patients were compared in order to determine the factors associated with NAFLD in HD patients. Findings Compared to those without NAFLD, nondiabetic HD patients with NAFLD had significantly higher mtDNA copy number and GPx levels. The two groups did not differ significantly in dialysis adequacy, hemoglobin, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, liver function tests, or lipid profiles. Regression analysis confirmed mtDNA copy numbers and GPx levels as two independent factors associated with NAFLD. Compared to those with polysulfone, patients dialyzed with cellulose membrane have significantly higher levels of TBARS. However, patients with or without NAFLD did not differ in their use of either dialysis membrane. Discussion Oxidative stress (represented by antioxidant defense, GPx) and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers are independently associated with fatty liver disease in nondiabetic HD patients. The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this key observation warrant further exploration.	Cardiovascular Diseases	blood
158	25684621	2093061423	25684621	Histones and DNA compete for binding polyphosphoinositides in bilayers.	Recent discoveries on the presence and location of phosphoinositides in the eukaryotic cell nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane prompted us to study the putative interaction of chromatin components with these lipids in model membranes (liposomes). Turbidimetric studies revealed that a variety of histones and histone combinations (H1, H2AH2B, H3H4, octamers) caused a dose-dependent aggregation of phosphatidylcholine vesicles (large unilamellar vesicle or small unilamellar vesicle) containing negatively charged phospholipids. 5 mol % phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) was enough to cause extensive aggregation under our conditions, whereas with phosphatidylinositol (PI) at least 20 mol % was necessary to obtain a similar effect. Histone binding to giant unilamellar vesicle and vesicle aggregation was visualized by confocal microscopy. Histone did not cause vesicle aggregation in the presence of DNA, and the latter was able to disassemble the histone-vesicle aggregates. At DNA/H1 weight ratios 0.1-0.5 DNA- and PIP-bound H1 appear to coexist. Isothermal calorimetry studies revealed that the PIP-H1 association constant was one order of magnitude higher than that of PI-H1, and the corresponding lipid/histone stoichiometries were ~0.5 and ~1, respectively. The results suggest that, in the nucleoplasm, a complex interplay of histones, DNA, and phosphoinositides may be taking place, particularly at the nucleoplasmic reticula that reach deep within the nucleoplasm, or during somatic and nonsomatic nuclear envelope assembly. The data described here provide a minimal model for analyzing and understanding the mechanism of these interactions.	DNA	metabolism

The role of combination chemotherapy in this setting is uncertain although several studies report satisfactory efficacy and safety using weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin (AUC=6) as first-line chemotherapy in elderly patients. It is still unclear which schedule of this regimen which could offer the best therapeutic index. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity and tolerability of concomitant weekly administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin in untreated elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. From february 2005 to April 2008 36 consecutive elderly patients with advanced NSClC were enrolled. Median age was 74 years (range, 70-83 years) and median ECOG pS was 1 (range, 0-1). Patients received carboplatin (AUC=2) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1,8 and 15 every 28 days. All patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity; a median of 4 cycles was administered. Twelve patients had partial response (33%; 95% C.I. 15,8- 52,3%), 10 patients (28%) showed stable disease. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5.7 months (95% C.I. 3.1-8.6 months) with a median overall survival (MOS) of 9 months (95% C.I. 4.4-13.9 months). Toxicity was mild with no cases of febrile neutropenia; 5 patients (14%) developed grade 2 neuropathy. Our study confirms the substantial activity of weekly regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Due to its favorable profile of toxicity this schedule could represent an interesting therapeutic option in selected chemonaive elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.	Lung Neoplasms	drug therapy
160	29909916	2400895312	29909916	Cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetic kidney disease.	In the past decades, chronic kidney disease has become a public health problem all over the world. Both the incidence and the prevalence are continually increasing. Diabetic nephropathy is, by far, the most frequent cause of CKD, with a prevalence of 40% in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Present studies have shown the fact that microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease are independently associated to a high risk of cardiovascular events, as well as to a high mortality rate of all causes and also of cardiovascular cause, both in the general population and also in patients with high risk or an already present cardiovascular disease. There is a permanent association between the level of urinary albumin excretion and the risk for cardiovascular disease, macroalbuminuria and clinical nephropathy being associated to a higher risk for cardiovascular events than microalbuminuria. Due to the importance of clinical data and low cost, microalbuminuria and glomerular filtration rate should be introduced in the clinical practice for the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, especially in the patients with previously known heart disease. An early identification of the factors that determine the emergence and progression of diabetes complications is essential, in order to reduce the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.

To investigate the effect on dietary intake of the PRo-active Interdisciplinary Self-MAnagement (PRISMA) program, developed analogous to DESMOND, in overweight type 2 diabetes patients.


METHODS
All type 2 diabetes patients referred to the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic of the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam with a BMI >25kg/m(2), were eligible for inclusion to the PRISMA program. At baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up, macronutrient intake, anthropometric, biomedical and psychosocial measures were evaluated by using Generalized Estimation Equations.


RESULTS
Included into the study were 38 patients, of which 22 completed a 1-year follow-up. After 6 months energy and macronutrient intake were significantly decreased. Reductions after 12 months were still significant for protein, unsaturated fat and dietary fiber and borderline significant for energy and saturated fat intake. Patients positively evaluated the program, and most patients held the view that they had learned something from PRISMA.


CONCLUSIONS
The PRISMA program reduced energy and macronutrient intake up to 6 months. After 6 months, attention should be paid to patients' food product choices. Follow-up counselling might further improve long-term outcome. This pilot study shows that the PRISMA program is promising in decreasing dietary intake in newly diagnosed and established overweight type 2 diabetes patients in secondary care."

163	218877082	3032764694	218877082	A comparison of two non-radioactive alternatives to wire for the localization of non-palpable breast cancers	Purpose Multiple wire-free technologies for localization of non-palpable breast cancers have emerged as satisfactory alternatives to wire. However, no study has compared two non-radioactive wire-free approaches to one another. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes among LOCalizer™ radiofrequency identification (RFID), SAVI Scout® (SAVI), and wire localization (WL). Methods This was a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study of patients undergoing lumpectomy for non-palpable breast cancer at a single institution between August 2017 and February 2019. Patients were divided into three cohorts based on localization technique: RFID, SAVI or WL. Operative times and average tumor volumes were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Positive margin and re-excision rates were compared with Fisher’s exact test. Results Among 104 patients who underwent lumpectomy for non-palpable breast cancer, 33 patients (31.7%) had RFID, 21 (20.2%) had SAVI, and 50 (48.0%) had WL. Operative times were 79 min for RFID, 81 min for SAVI, and 78 min for WL ( p  = 0.91). Volume of tissue resected was 36.3 cm 3 , 31.7 cm 3 , and 35.3 cm 3 for RFID, SAVI, and WL, respectively ( p  = 0.84). Positive margin rates (RFID 3.0% vs SAVI 9.5% vs WL 8.0%, p  = 0.67) and re-excision rates (RFID 6.1% vs SAVI 9.5% vs WL 10.0%, p  = 0.82) were similar across groups. Conclusions Wire-free localization technologies have been compared to WL demonstrating similar efficacy. Our study suggests that RFID and SAVI Scout also perform similarly to one another. Physicians and institutions may consider more nuanced features of each localization system rather than performance alone when choosing a wire-free alternative.	Breast Neoplasms	surgery

165	24897553	1968353376	24897553	Transcription of isolated mouse liver chromatin.	Analysis of RNA transcription from isolated mouse liver chromatin has been undertaken by means of RNA-excess hybridizations with small amounts of radioactive DNA. This analysis indicates that mouse liver chromatin is a restricted template for the in vitro synthesis of RNA complements to repetitive DNA, but more RNA species are synthesized than are found in the RNA isolated from mouse liver nuclei. Extraction with 0.5 M NaC1 destroys the template restriction of isolated chromatin. RNA synthesized in vitro from DNA or chromatin templates by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, as well as in vivo mouse liver nuclear RNA, were each hybridized to 125I-labeled DNA of high, intermediate, or low reiteration frequency. Chromatin-primed and nuclear RNA saturate a smaller portion of each DNA fraction than does DNA-primed RNA. However, chromatin-primed RNA saturates more high and low reiteration frequency DNA than does nuclear RNA. Simultaneous hybridization of nuclear-and chromatin-primed RNA with 125I-labeled DNA indicates that chromatin-primed RNA contains all of the sequences present in nuclear RNA. Extraction of chromatin with 0.5 MNaC1 leads to removal of histone F1, as well as a wide variety of non-histone proteins. When used as a template for in vitro RNA synthesis, such salt-extracted chromatin produced RNAs that hybridize as large a portion of each DNA fraction as does DNA-primed RNA.	Liver	metabolism
166	4382444	2399679346	4382444	Ciguatoxin reduces regenerative capacity of axotomized peripheral neurons and delays functional recovery in pre-exposed mice after peripheral nerve injury	Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) results from consumption of tropical reef fish containing ciguatoxins (CTXs). Pacific (P)-CTX-1 is among the most potent known CTXs and the predominant source of CFP in the endemic region responsible for the majority of neurological symptoms in patients. Chronic and persistent neurological symptoms occur in some CFP patients, which often result in incomplete functional recovery for years. However, the direct effects of exposure to CTXs remain largely unknown. In present study, we exposed mice to CTX purified from ciguatera fish sourced from the Pacific region. P-CTX-1 was detected in peripheral nerves within hours and persisted for two months after exposure. P-CTX-1 inhibited axonal regrowth from axotomized peripheral neurons in culture. P-CTX-1 exposure reduced motor function in mice within the first two weeks of exposure before returning to baseline levels. These pre-exposed animals exhibited delayed sensory and motor functional recovery, and irreversible motor deficits after peripheral nerve injury in which formation of functional synapses was impaired. These findings are consistent with reduced muscle function, as assessed by electromyography recordings. Our study provides strong evidence that the persistence of P-CTX-1 in peripheral nerves reduces the intrinsic growth capacity of peripheral neurons, resulting in delayed functional recovery after injury.

167	201105898	2969545909	201105898	Syringeable immunotherapeutic nanogel reshapes tumor microenvironment and prevents tumor metastasis and recurrence	The low response rate of current cancer immunotherapy suggests the presence of few antigen-specific T cells and a high number of immunosuppressive factors in tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we develop a syringeable immunomodulatory multidomain nanogel (iGel) that overcomes the limitation by reprogramming of the pro-tumoral TME to antitumoral immune niches. Local and extended release of immunomodulatory drugs from iGel deplete immunosuppressive cells, while inducing immunogenic cell death and increased immunogenicity. When iGel is applied as a local postsurgical treatment, both systemic antitumor immunity and a memory T cell response are generated, and the recurrence and metastasis of tumors to lungs and other organs are significantly inhibited. Reshaping of the TME using iGel also reverts non-responding groups to checkpoint blockade therapies into responding groups. The iGel is expected as an immunotherapeutic platform that can reshape immunosuppressive TMEs and synergize cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint therapies, with minimized systemic toxicity. The limited efficacy of current immunotherapy suggests low antigen-specific T cells and immunosuppressive factors in tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, the authors develop a syringeable immunomodulatory multi-domain nanogel that can reprogram the TME and induce enhanced cancer immunotherapy.	Neoplasms	drug therapy

Pigs have become increasingly popular in large-animal translational neuroscience research as an economically and ethically feasible substitute to non-human primates. The large brain size of the pig allows the use of conventional clinical brain imagers and the direct use and testing of neurosurgical procedures and equipment from the human clinic. Further macroscopic and histological analysis, however, requires postmortem exposure of the pig central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent brain removal. This is not an easy task, as the pig CNS is encapsulated by a thick, bony skull and spinal column. The goal of this paper and instructional video is to describe how to expose and remove the postmortem pig brain and the pituitary gland in an intact state, suitable for subsequent macroscopic and histological analysis.

Preferential inhibition of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis was observed. No effect of oxolinic acid and coumermycin on rRNA synthesis was seen in mutants having a DNA gyrase which is resistant to these inhibitors. In a temperature-sensitive DNA gyrase mutant rRNA synthesis was decreased at nonpermissive temperatures. Thus, a functional DNA gyrase is required for rRNA synthesis. Purified DNA gyrase had no effect on rRNA synthesis in a purified system. However, DNA gyrase does show preferential stimulation of rRNA synthesis in a system supplemented with other proteins. Apparently, DNA gyrase stimulation of rRNA synthesis requires another protein.	Escherichia coli	metabolism
171	43733725	2087163033	43733725	Expression of the mRNAs coding for the glucocorticoid receptor isoforms in obesity.	"OBJECTIVE
Glucocorticoids may be a pathophysiological mediator for the development of visceral obesity. In obese patients, adipose tissue reactivation of cortisone to cortisol is enhanced. In addition, changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) could also be important, either at the central nervous system level, by modulating the negative glucocorticoid feedback, or at a peripheral level, by regulating adipose tissue activity.


RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES
Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we studied the expression of the GR mRNA isoforms (active, GRalpha; inactive, GRbeta) in circulating mononuclear leukocytes (in which GR shares the same regulation with central nervous system GR) obtained from normal weight women (n = 65) and patients with gluteofemoral (n = 26) or visceral (n = 39) obesity. Using in situ hybridization, we measured GRalpha mRNA levels in adipose tissue from control (n = 10) or obese (n = 15) patients.


RESULTS
The mean alpha/beta ratio was decreased in mononuclear leukocytes from obese patients (2.6, 9.2, and 32.1, respectively). GRalpha mRNA levels were significantly decreased in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue obtained from obese patients compared with nonobese ones, suggesting the existence of a downregulation of GR gene expression. This phenomenon was not found in visceral adipose tissue.


DISCUSSION
This suggests that, in obese patients, the relative insensitivity to the negative glucocorticoid feedback is, at least in part, subsequent to a dysregulation of the GRalpha/GRbeta ratio and that visceral, but not subcutaneous, adipose tissue retains a full capacity to respond to increased local generation of cortisol."

DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) fills single nucleotide (nt) gaps in DNA produced by the base excision repair pathway of mammalian cells. Crystal structures have been determined representing intermediates in the 1 nt gap-filling reaction of pol beta: the binary complex with a gapped DNA substrate (2.4 A resolution), the ternary complex including ddCTP (2.2 A), and the binary product complex containing only nicked DNA (2.6 A). Upon binding ddCTP to the binary gap complex, the thumb subdomain rotates into the closed conformation to contact the otherwise solvent-exposed ddCTP-template base pair. Thumb movement triggers further conformational changes which poise catalytic residue Asp192, dNTP, and template for nucleotidyl transfer, effectively assembling the active site. In the product nicked DNA complex, the thumb returns to the open conformation as in the gapped binary DNA complex, facilitating dissociation of the product. These findings suggest that pol beta may enhance fidelity by an induced fit mechanism in which correct base pairing between template and incoming dNTP induces alignment of catalytic groups for catalysis (via thumb closure), but incorrect base pairing will not. The structures also reveal that pol beta binds both gapped and nicked DNA with a 90 degrees kink occurring precisely at the 5'-phosphodiester linkage of the templating residue. If the DNA were not kinked in this way, contact between the thumb and dNTP-template base pair, presumably important for the checking mechanism, would be impossible, especially when the gap is but a single nucleotide. Such a 90 degrees kink may be a mechanistic feature employed by any polymerase involved in filling gaps to completion.	DNA	metabolism
174	22786460	1787370438	22786460	Practical limitations to a positive deviance approach for identifying dietary patterns compatible with the reduction of cancer risk.	"BACKGROUND
The positive deviance (PD) approach seeks to devise and promote health-promoting practices identified within the most successful member of a society. The World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) recommendations indicate the need for specific dietary behaviours, which may be considered impractical. Thus, it is important to demonstrate ways in which these dietary practices have been achieved from concordant individuals. The present study aimed to assess the feasibility of constructing healthy eating guides in four international settings.


METHODS
Adult participants from the Netherlands (n = 1052), Scotland (n = 849), Mexico (n = 790) and Guatemala (n = 873) enrolled in an international diet survey project. Participants with inadequate diets and current smokers were excluded from the analysis. Concordance with selected WCRF/AICR individual guideline components related to diet and lifestyle were evaluated. A selection of participants was made towards making a set of 14 rotating menus for a cancer-prevention healthy-eating guide.


RESULTS
Overall concordance with the WCRF/AICR recommendations was low in all four nations and no participants with an ideal behaviour were found. The selection of candidates for constructing 14 daily menus for a single national guide identified 51, 13 and 12 individuals concordant with 11 of 14 WCRF/AICR recommendation components in Guatemala, Scotland and Mexico, respectively, and 24 individuals concordant with eight of 14 WCRF/AICR components in the Netherlands.


CONCLUSIONS
The basis for PD guidance for developing dietary recommendations for cancer prevention was strong across all social classes in Guatemala, marginal for Mexico and Scotland, and effectively impossible for the Netherlands."	Neoplasms	prevention & control

176	43115314	2614377727	43115314	[Automatization of a hospital-based tumor registry].	"INTRODUCTION
To increase data reliability and reduce the costs associated with the HTR, the Catalan Institute of Oncology programmed the manual procedures of data collection from databases by means of a computer application (ASEDAT).


MATERIAL AND METHOD
ASEDAT detects the incident tumors of the registry from the databases of the pathology records (PR) and discharge records (DR) and selects the basic information from both databases. Data from the HTR data was collected for the period 1999-2000 by means of 2 procedures: manual and automatized collection and the results obtained were compared.


RESULTS
10,498 cancer patients were detected. Manual resolution detected 8,309 incident tumors and 2,374 prevalent tumors. ASEDAT automatically detected 8,901 patients (84.8%), in whom 8,367 incident tumors were detected (58 more tumors than the manual procedure). Validation of agreement was performed in the incident tumors detected by both methods (7,063 tumors). In 6,185 tumors (87.6%) the information agreed in all the variables. Of the discordant tumors, 692 (9.8%) were obtained by the RHT staff using manual resolution, and the remainder (186; 2.6%) were obtained by the application (automatic resolution).


CONCLUSIONS
Cancer registry automatization is feasible when PR and DR databases are available, coded and automatized."	Neoplasms	epidemiology
177	204975574	2988363676	204975574	EGFR is a Therapeutic Target in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.	"BACKGROUND/AIMS
Despite effective therapeutic strategies for treating hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, resistance to endocrine therapy that is either de novo or acquired still occurs. We investigated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a therapeutic target for overcoming endocrine resistance in HR+ breast cancer models.


METHODS
Using clinical data from 2,166 patients who had HR+ breast tumors and received tamoxifen, we analyzed survival rates. Levels of mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assays and anchorage-independent growth by soft agar colony-formation assays. Efficacy of tamoxifen and/or gefitinib was analyzed using orthotopic xenograft mouse models.


RESULTS
EGFR expression was significantly associated with more advanced stage and higher grade. EGFR expression was different in luminal A-like (Lum A, 1.3%) versus luminal B-like (Lum B, 11.4%) subtypes. On multivariate analyses for survival Lum B subtype EGFR+ tumors showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 5.22 (95% CI, 1.29-21.15, P = 0.020) for overall survival (OS) and HR of 2.91 (95% CI, 1.35-6.28, P = 0.006) for disease-free survival (DFS). Levels of EGFR inversely correlated with ER-α expression. Basal ER-α level was completely blocked by TGFA or EGF treatment. With TGFA pretreatment, ER+ breast cancer cells were resistant to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Conversely, downregulation of ER-α by TGFA was reversed by gefitinib with recovered sensitivity to 4-OHT. Tumorigenicity of EGFR and ER+ breast cancer cells were significantly decreased by combined tamoxifen and gefitinib.


CONCLUSION
Aberrant EGFR expression was associated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancers, especially the Lum B subtype. Loss of ER by EGFR activation induced tamoxifen resistance. Therefore, EGFR could be a therapeutic target for overcoming recurrence of ER+ breast cancer with high EGFR expression."	Breast Neoplasms	pathology

To determine whether plasma endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictive peptide, is elevated in NIDDM patients, we compared a group of 15 NIDDM patients with macroangiopathy of mean age 60.60 +/- 2.33 years with 15 NIDDM randomly selected matched patients without macroangiopathy. Plasma endothelin levels were significantly increased in NIDDM patients with macroangiopathy (4.22 +/- 0.57 pmol/L) and in NIDDM patients without macroangiopathy (3.81 +/- 0.51 pmol/L). Although endothelin values did not differ between NIDDM groups, both represented significant difference from control values (2.46 +/- 0.24 pmol/L). No significant correlations were found between plasma endothelin and age (rs = 0.11), duration of diabetes mellitus (rs = 0.06), BMI (rs = 0.19), plasma glucose (rs = 0.15), plasma fructosamine (rs = 0.02). These findings confirm that in diabetes mellitus a primary disturbance in endothelin production from vascular endothelium exists as an early phenomenon rather than a result of advanced stage of the disease.

An age-related deterioration of sensory-motor functions, motility and exploratory activity was observed in all the senescent animals independent of diet. Swimming ability did not deteriorate with age. Spatial memory, evaluated by the Morris water maze test, showed some deterioration in normally fed adult rats as indicated by the deceleration in the learning curve. In aged rats, not only was learning slowed down, but memory utilization was also impaired. These cognitive deficiencies were absent in rats fed the hypocaloric diet.	Aging	physiology
180	1798368	2092293756	1798368	Neuronal encoding of the distance traversed by covert shifts of spatial attention	Neurons in monkey medial superior temporal cortex selectively respond to the patterned visual motion in optic flow that simulates observer self-movement. We trained monkeys in a task that required behavioral responses indicating the location of a precue or the simulated heading direction in a subsequent optic flow stimulus. Medial superior temporal neuronal responses contained transient peaks at latencies proportionate to the distance from the precue to the heading direction represented by the subsequent optic flow. We conclude that these response transients reveal neural mechanisms underlying covert shifts of spatial attention and that the varying latency of these transients reflect the time required for reorientation between attentional targets.

181	45907392	2051256331	45907392	Functional complementation of the mvrA mutation of Escherichia coli by plant ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase.	Escherichia coli cells carrying the mvrA mutation are unable to grow aerobically in the presence of the radical propagator methyl viologen (MV). Resistance against MV toxicity could be restored by the introduction of cloned DNA sequences encoding pea chloroplast ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR), a member of a class of flavoenzymes involved in redox pathways in bacteria, plants and animals. Complementation was strictly dependent on the accumulation of a functional transgenic FNR, since mutated reductases showing decreased enzymatic activities only partially rescued the MV-resistant phenotype. These results support recent observations suggesting that the E. coli mvrA gene encodes a ferredoxin (flavodoxin)-NADP+ reductase (V. Bianchi et al. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 1590-1595). The mvrA mutant cells showed a moderate decrease in the flavodoxin-dependent activation of enzymes essential for anaerobic growth of E. coli. This effect is prevented by expression of a functional pea FNR in the mutant cells.	Escherichia coli	enzymology
182	13553897	2123211579	13553897	Factors influencing plasma nevirapine levels: a study in HIV-infected children on generic antiretroviral treatment in India.	"BACKGROUND
Nevirapine is an important component of paediatric combination HIV therapy. Adequate drug exposure is necessary in order to achieve long-lasting viral suppression.


OBJECTIVES
To study the influence of age, drug dose and formulation type, nutritional status and CYP2B6 516G>T polymorphism on blood concentrations of nevirapine in children treated with generic antiretroviral drugs.


METHODS
A multicentre study was conducted at four sites in India. HIV-infected children receiving generic nevirapine-based fixed-dose combinations were recruited. Trough and 2 h nevirapine plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC. Characterization of the CYP2B6 gene polymorphism was performed using direct sequencing. Clinical and nutritional status was recorded. Groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors contributing to low drug levels.


RESULTS
Ninety-four children of median age 78 months were studied; 60% were undernourished or stunted. Stunted children had a significantly lower 2 h nevirapine concentration compared with non-stunted children (P < 0.05); there were no significant differences in trough concentrations between different nutritional groups. Nevirapine levels were significantly higher in children with TT compared with GG and GT CYP2B6 genotypes (P < 0.01). Children ≤ 3 years had a 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.07-9.45) times higher risk of having sub-therapeutic nevirapine concentrations.


CONCLUSIONS
Nevirapine blood concentrations are affected by many factors, most notably age ≤ 3 years; a combination of young age, stunting and CYP2B6 GG or GT genotype could potentially result in sub-therapeutic nevirapine concentrations. Dosing recommendations for children should be reviewed in the light of these findings."	HIV Infections	drug therapy

184	34442640	2086080786	34442640	Platinum-based compounds and risk for cardiovascular toxicity in the elderly: role of the antioxidants in chemoprevention.	Cancer in elderly patients is an increasingly common problem. Older patients have more co-morbidity, therefore the toxic effects of chemotherapy treatment are less tolerable compared to younger patients. Platinum-based compounds (PBCs) are commonly used cytotoxic agents in the treatment of several solid tumors; however, their application is still limited in elderly patients, due to the risks in cardiovascular toxicity. The increased risk for myocardial ischemia, stroke, and vascular thrombosis linked with PBCs treatment is mainly due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the subsequent induction of oxidative stress and switch to a prothrombotic condition. Recently, studies have shown a different genetic susceptibility in cardiovascular toxicity induced by therapy with PBCs. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, selenium, lycopene, melatonin, and resveratrol, have been implicated in cancer treatment by their property to suppress the oxidant injury. Resveratrol, especially, has been shown to increase the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin. In addition, resveratrol's ability to activate the sirtuin1 (SIRT1) pathway has been heavily implicated in the mechanisms controlling longevity and quality of life in the aged population. This article reviews the current state of treatment with PBCs and their associated risk for cardiovascular disease. It discusses the most powerful antioxidant supplementation options as a possible strategy to reduce the cardiovascular toxicity effects of chemotherapy in the elderly.	Aging	drug effects

Bernhard Kuch ()) Matthias Riehle, MD · Wolfgang von Scheidt, MD I. Medizinische Klinik Klinikum Augsburg Lehrkrankenhaus der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen Stenglinstr. 2 86156 Augsburg, Germany Tel.: +49-8 21 /4002956 Fax: +49-8 21 /4003345 E-Mail: bernhard.kuch@1med.zk-augsburg-med.de Sirs: Myocardial infarction belongs to the leading causes of death in industrialized nations [19]. Major mechanisms of death in myocardial infarction are arrhythmias and systolic ventricular failure due to the loss of contractile function. Other mechanical complications leading to death or acute deteriorations in previously stable patients are ruptured papillary muscles with the consequence of severe mitral insufficiency, ventricular septal defects or rupture of the free left ventricular wall leading to acute tamponade. We here describe a rare complication of acute inferior myocardial infarction in a patient who developed severe hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting via a patent foramen ovale (PFO), successfully treated with revascularization, preload reduction, and, finally, percutaneous closure of the PFO.

186	205282282	2063146856	205282282	Survivin expression and targeting in breast cancer.	"INTRODUCTION
Survivin a multifunctional protein that controls cell division, inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of angiogenesis. It is expressed in most human neoplasm, but is absent in normal and differentiated tissues. The purpose of this article is to overview the expression of survivin, effect of its expression in response to treatment, correlation with other markers and newer advancement in targeting survivin.


METHODS
A detailed search of Medline was carried out using the following search strategy: ""((survivin) OR ((apoptosis) AND (inhibitor OR inhibitors))) AND ((breast) AND (neoplasm OR neoplasms OR tumor OR tumor OR cancer OR carcinoma))"". Abstract of all articles thus identified were reviewed to identify the relevant studies, full articles of studies thus identified were then obtained and reviewed. All relevant data was extracted and tabulated.


RESULTS
Survivin expression by Immunohistochemistry was identified in 65.3% (55.2-90.0%) of the breast cancer patients among the identified studies while survivin mRNA by RT-PCR was identified in 93.6% (90-97%). Survivin expression has been reported to be associated with over expression of HER 2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/PAI-1.


CONCLUSION
Survivin is over expressed in majority of breast cancers. The over expression of survivin is found to correlate with HER 2 and EGFR expression. Survivin expression has been found to confer resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Targeting survivin in experimental models improves survival. More studies are needed on the role of survivin in multi drug resistance (MDR) in the presence of Pgp/uPA/PAI-1 and the impact of survivin over expression in triple negative breast cancer."

187	81142390	2896182998	81142390	[The Disease History, Sociodemographics, and Criminal Features of the Homicidal Forensic Psychiatric Patients].	"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to evaluate the disease history, treatment adherence, and the criminal history of individuals who committed a homicide offence, with no criminal responsibility due to their psychiatric illness METHODS: Of 197 who had been released from our forensic psychiatric clinic after one-year-mandatory inpatient treatment, we evaluated 160 patients whom we were able to contact. To determine the severity of the crimes, criminal violence rating scale was used. The sociodemographic characterictics and certain variables associated with the disease and the criminal acts of the individuals were documented.


RESULTS
Out of 160 patients, 48 had committed serious homicidal crime while 112 had committed milder or moderate crimes. All homicidal offenders were male. Most were single or divorced, living in metropolitan areas. 29.2% were unemployed. Of the homicidal offenders, 89.6% had a legal guardian, 93.8% had social insurance, 83.3% had psychiatric disorder with psychotic features. 29.2% of homicide offenders had criminal history even prior to the mandatory treatment, most of which were severe violent criminal offenses targeting directly a victim's life.


CONCLUSIONS
Among homicidal offenders, diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders were more and psychiatric comorbidities were less prevalent. The correlation of homicide and unemployment points to the importance of occupational rehabilitation. Identifying preventive factors and determining the risk of the homicidal behavior in individuals with mental disorders are important for the protection of both the patient and the public."

188	24476909	122568697	24476909	Acute ozone-induced change in airway permeability: role of infiltrating leukocytes.	The role of infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in acute lung injury and inflammation is still controversial. In inbred mice, acute ozone (O3) exposure induces airway inflammation that is characterized by a maximal influx of lavageable PMNs 6 h after exposure and a maximal increase in lung permeability 24 h after O3. We tested the hypothesis that O3-induced change in airway epithelial permeability of O3-susceptible C57BL/6J mice is due to infiltrating PMNs. Male mice (6-8 wk) were treated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (indomethacin), a chemotactic inhibitor (colchicine), or an immunosuppressant (cyclophosphamide) to deplete or inhibit PMNs from infiltrating the airways. After drug or vehicle treatment, mice were exposed for 3 h to 2 ppm O3 or filtered air, and pulmonary inflammation was assessed by inflammatory cell counts and total protein content (a marker of airway permeability) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Filtered air exposure did not affect the parameters of pulmonary inflammation at any time after exposure. Compared with vehicle controls, each of the drug treatments resulted in significant reduction of PMN influx 6 and 24 h after O3. However, total BAL protein content was not attenuated significantly by the three treatments at either 6 or 24 h postexposure. Results of these experiments suggest that the influx of PMNs and the change in total BAL protein are not mutually dependent events in this model and suggest that infiltrating PMNs do not play a major role in acute O3-induced changes in permeability of the murine lung.

189	28294372	2131280101	28294372	Effect of desipramine on Ca2+ levels and growth in renal tubular cells.	The in vitro effect of desipramine on renal tubular cell is unknown. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the effect of desipramine on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by using fura-2. Desipramine (>25 microM) caused a rapid and sustained rise of [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=50 microM). Desipramine-induced [Ca2+]i rise was prevented by 40% by removal of extracellular Ca2+ but was not altered by L-type Ca2+ channel blockers. In Ca2+-free medium, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, caused a monophasic [Ca2+]i rise, after which desipramine failed to release more Ca2+; in addition, pretreatment with desipramine partly decreased thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i increase. U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, did not change desipramine-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Incubation with 10-100 microM desipramine enhances or inhibits cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of desipramine on proliferation was not extracellular Ca2+-dependent. Apoptosis appears to contribute to desipramine-induced cell death. Together, these findings suggest that desipramine increases baseline [Ca2+]i in renal tubular cells by evoking both extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release, and can cause apoptosis.

190	8345512	2043882961	8345512	Insight into the specific virulence related genes and toxin-antitoxin virulent pathogenicity islands in swine streptococcosis pathogen Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus strain ATCC35246	BackgroundStreptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) is an important pathogen causing swine streptococcosis in China. Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) of S. zooepidemicus have been transferred among bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and play important roles in the adaptation and increased virulence of S. zooepidemicus. The present study used comparative genomics to examine the different pathogenicities of S. zooepidemicus.ResultsGenome of S. zooepidemicus ATCC35246 (Sz35246) comprises 2,167,264-bp of a single circular chromosome, with a GC content of 41.65%. Comparative genome analysis of Sz35246, S. zooepidemicus MGCS10565 (Sz10565), Streptococcus equi. ssp. equi. 4047 (Se4047) and S. zooepidemicus H70 (Sz70) identified 320 Sz35246-specific genes, clustered into three toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems PAIs and one restriction modification system (RM system) PAI. These four acquired PAIs encode proteins that may contribute to the overall pathogenic capacity and fitness of this bacterium to adapt to different hosts. Analysis of the in vivo and in vitro transcriptomes of this bacterium revealed differentially expressed PAI genes and non-PAI genes, suggesting that Sz35246 possess mechanisms for infecting animals and adapting to a wide range of host environments. Analysis of the genome identified potential Sz35246 virulence genes. Genes of the Fim III operon were presumed to be involved in breaking the host-restriction of Sz35246.ConclusionGenome wide comparisons of Sz35246 with three other strains and transcriptome analysis revealed novel genes related to bacterial virulence and breaking the host-restriction. Four specific PAIs, which were judged to have been transferred into Sz35246 genome through HGT, were identified for the first time. Further analysis of the TA and RM systems in the PAIs will improve our understanding of the pathogenicity of this bacterium and could lead to the development of diagnostics and vaccines.

The objectives of our study were to create a database of breast cancer patients in Central Kerala between January 2010 and December 2012 and analyze the proportions of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer.MethodsEstrogen and progesterone receptor status were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.ResultsThe median age at diagnosis was 50 years while the mean age was 51.92 (SD = 11.78). 56.1% of premenopausal and 47.4% of postmenopausal patients were found to be ER positive, while PR positivity was 47.7% and 34.7% respectively in the premenopausal and postmenopausal age groups.ConclusionsThe proportions of ER and PRnegative tumors were found to be lower than reported in earlier studies on Indian populations. Contrary to expectations, the proportions of ER and PRpositivity were found to be higher in the premenopausal age group.	Breast Neoplasms	metabolism

Female transgenic mice that express SV40 T/t antigens under the regulatory control of the rat C3(1) gene spontaneously develop multifocal mammary lesions that predictably evolve into invasive, hormone-independent carcinomas, whereas male mice are prone to develop prostate cancer. Chemopreventive agents were administered to female C3(1)/SV40 large T-antigen mice from 7 to 19 weeks of age, during which time the mammary lesions developed and progressed to invasive carcinomas. No significant differences in the numbers of preinvasive mammary intraepithelial neoplasia lesions (histologically similar to human ductal carcinoma in situ) were observed after 2 or 8 weeks of treatment between mice receiving either vehicle alone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), or 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). However, a dose-response reduction in invasive carcinoma growth was observed for both DFMO, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, and DHEA, the primary steroid precursor to both androgens and estrogens in primates. Despite unaltered expression of the transgene, tumor incidence was reduced approximately 20% by DFMO (8000 mg/kg) and 30% by DHEA (4000 mg/kg; P < 0.05). Tumor multiplicity was reduced by approximately 50% by both DFMO and DHEA (P < 0.05). DFMO had a dose-dependent effect on total tumor burden, which was reduced by 25% at low doses (4000 mg/kg) and 70% at high doses (8000 mg/kg). DHEA reduced tumor burden by 50% and 66% at low (2000 mg/kg) and high (4000 mg/kg) doses, respectively. Interestingly, despite its inhibitory effects on tumor development, DHEA caused a dose-dependent increase of serum estradiol levels that we have previously shown to increase mammary tumor formation in this model. No effect on the development of the prostate cancer precursor lesions (prostate intraepithelial neoplasia) was observed when mice were treated with DHEA, DFMO, tocopherol acetate, selenomethionine, or 9-cis-retinoic acid, although the effects on late-stage prostate cancer development were not determined. These results demonstrate that despite the expression of the highly transforming C3(1)/SV40 large T-antigen transgene, this transgenic model can be used to study the effects of chemopreventive agents on mammary cancer progression. The tumor-inhibitory effects of DHEA and DFMO on mammary cancer growth appear to occur after the development of preinvasive lesions, suggesting that these agents inhibit tumor progression but not initiation.

"The developing infrastructure for tumour documentation in Germany offers the unique opportunity to provide the physicians with useful clinical information, to evaluate standards of care, and get an impression about the ""real-world-effectiveness"" of cancer care. In order to compare and evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in different medical institutions or health care systems, the systematic, patient-oriented, treatment accompanying tumour documentation is a compelling requirement. Our intention is to optimise content and extent of the collected information to characterise the different dimensions of the quality of medical care the best possible. We found that most of the problems are deriving from the contextually and timely correct documentation of medical procedures which includes diagnostic as well as therapeutic interventions. The content of the documentation together with standards of care, such as Clinical Practice Guidelines, should be parallel developed in interdisciplinary co-operation. This way, the fundamental domains of performance, such as appropriateness, availability, continuity, safety, effectiveness, and timeliness of medical care can described and evaluated objectively."

194	5683327	2147933049	5683327	FtsEX is required for CwlO peptidoglycan hydrolase activity during cell wall elongation in Bacillus subtilis	The peptidoglycan (PG) sacculus, a meshwork of polysaccharide strands cross‐linked by short peptides, protects bacterial cells against osmotic lysis. To enlarge this covalently closed macromolecule, PG hydrolases must break peptide cross‐links in the meshwork to allow insertion of new glycan strands between the existing ones. In the rod‐shaped bacterium Bacillus subtilis, cell wall elongation requires two redundant endopeptidases, CwlO and LytE. However, it is not known how these potentially autolytic enzymes are regulated to prevent lethal breaches in the cell wall. Here, we show that the ATP‐binding cassette transporter‐like FtsEX complex is required for CwlO activity. In Escherichia coli, FtsEX is thought to harness ATP hydrolysis to activate unrelated PG hydrolases during cell division. Consistent with this regulatory scheme, B. subtilis FtsE mutants that are unable to bind or hydrolyse ATP cannot activate CwlO. Finally, we show that in cells depleted of both CwlO and LytE, the PG synthetic machinery continues moving circumferentially until cell lysis, suggesting that cross‐link cleavage is not required for glycan strand polymerization. Overall, our data support a model in which the FtsEX complex is a remarkably flexible regulatory module capable of controlling a diverse set of PG hydrolases during growth and division in different organisms.

Random dot kinematograms (RDK), plaids and fragmented plaid pattern were presented in which direction vectors of the moving elements were varied. In order to elicit coherent motion perception, all elements were displaced in the same direction (delta0 degrees). In a second condition, fifty percent of the elements were moved diagonally downwards to the left, with the remaining elements moving orthogonally (delta 90 degrees). Simultaneously with psychophysical judgements on the perceived motion direction, visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded at occipital electrode positions. Onset of a global coherent motion was associated with a VEP negativity occurring at about 200 ms. The amplitude of this component was clearly reduced when local ambiguous signals could not be integrated to produce the perception of global coherent motion.	Brain	physiology

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are potentially chemopreventive.


OBJECTIVE
We examined the relation between NSAID use and nonmelanoma skin cancer in a population-based case-control study.


METHODS
NSAID and analgesic use was analyzed in 1484 participants: 535 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 487 with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and 462 control subjects.


RESULTS
Use of NSAIDs, particularly aspirin, was associated with a reduced odds ratio (OR) of SCC, especially tumors positive for p53 (OR 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.79) or with PTCH loss of heterozygosity (OR 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.96). Although not considered a NSAID, decreased ORs of both basal cell carcinoma and SCC were observed in relation to use of paracetamol (acetaminophen). Risk of BCC was unrelated to NSAID use.


LIMITATIONS
Self-reported drug use was a limitation.


CONCLUSIONS
This study supports the hypothesis that NSAIDs, aspirin in particular, may reduce risk of SCC and may affect specific molecular subtypes of SCC."	Carcinoma, Squamous Cell	prevention & control
197	36860517	2033991282	36860517	The consumption of glucose during ex vivo lung perfusion correlates with lung edema.	"INTRODUCTION
Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has been recently proposed to recondition organs before transplantation from donors with marginal or unacceptable features. The aim of our investigation was to explore glucose consumption during EVLP.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We investigated 8 domestic pigs (mean weight, 21 ± 0.8 kg). After perfusion with Perfadex, retrieval, and back table surgery, we initiated EVLP. The lungs were perfused with Steen solution with added methylprednisolone, cefazoline, and heparin. The blood flow was gradually increased with a target of 40% of the estimated cardiac output (or less if the pulmonary artery pressure was >15 mm Hg), while keeping the left atrial pressure between 3 and 5 mm Hg. The temperature of the perfusate was increased from 25 °C to 37 °C. Once the temperature of the lung outflow was >32 °C, we began gas flow (4 L/min, 5%-8% CO(2) in air) and mechanical ventilation. EVLP parameters and blood gases were measured throughout the experiment; glucose consumption was calculated as (glucose initial-glucose final)/time. The wet to dry ratio was also calculated as an index of lung edema.


RESULTS
When stratified by median glucose consumption (0.237 mg/min), high glucose consumers (0.588 ± 0.17) were characterized by worse lung function, as assessed by oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen/inspiratory fraction of oxygen [PaO(2)/FiO(2)] 326 ± 63 mm Hg vs 218 ± 84; P=.083 low vs high, respectively), and lung edema (wet/dry ratio 6.5 ± 0.7 vs 8.6 ± 0.9; P=.012). Glucose consumption correlated with wet to dry ratio (R(2)=0.663; P=.014).


CONCLUSIONS
We found that the worse the lung function, the greater the consumption of glucose during EVLP. This observation suggests the need to explore lung metabolism during EVLP to possibly obtain metrics for evaluation."	Lung	surgery

The objective of this study was to see the effect of purified heparin binding oviduct specific proteins (OSP) as media supplement on in vitro embryo developmental competence in cattle. The oviduct specific proteins were isolated from abattoir cattle oviducts and precipitated, dialyzed and at the end purified by high performance liquid chromatography system. The SDS-PAGE profile of eluted heparin binding protein (HBP) fraction showed bands between approximately 66-approximately 97 kDa, while heparin unbinding protein (HUBP) fraction showed two bands at approximately 66 kDa and in total protein (TP) bands were approximately 60-approximately 95 kDa. Collected all three OSP fractions were used as a media supplement in three different concentrations (0, 5 and 20 microg/mL) for in vitro maturation of immature oocytes, in vitro fertilization and culture of presumptive embryos at 38.5 degrees C in 5% CO2 incubator with maximum humidity. The highest cleavage rate (73.40 +/- 2.36%) was observed at 5 microg/mL concentration level and lowest cleavage rate (27.63 +/- 1.89%) was obtained in 20 microg/mL total protein (TP) fraction. The highest blastocyst formation (26.47 +/- 1.47%) also occurred in 5 microg/mL concentration of total protein (TP) fraction and the lowest blastocyst rate (3.60 +/- 1.80%) was achieved at 20 microg/mL HBP fraction. The highest cleavage rate in the control group was 60.45 +/- 2.66% in TP fraction and blastocyst formation was 11.66 +/- 2.54% in HUBP fraction which was not significantly differ from HBP fraction. These results indicate that at 5 microg/mL of total OSP fraction (TP) and HBP used as media supplement increased the cleavage rate significantly as compared to HUBP fraction, and total OSP fraction (TP) increased blastocyst formation significantly (P < 0.05) as compared to HBP & HUBP fraction.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is closely linked to hyperandrogenism (HA). In PCOS, HA has been associated with metabolic disturbances that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).


Objective
To assess the association of high serum androgen levels, as a postmenopausal remnant of PCOS, with the prevalence of atherosclerosis and incidence of CVD in postmenopausal women.


Design
The Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study. Median follow-up was 11.36 years.


Setting
General community.


Participants
A total of 2578 women aged >55 years. Exclusion criteria were missing informed consent or follow-up data, perimenopausal status, and menopause by surgical intervention or at an unnatural age (age <40 or >62).


Intervention
None.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Linear, logistic, and Cox regression models assessed the association of top quartiles (P75) of serum testosterone, free androgen index (FAI), dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione and sex hormone-binding globulin with coronary artery calcium, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), pulse wave velocity, peripheral artery disease, and incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD.


Results
Mean age (standard deviation) was 70.19 (8.71) years, and average time since menopause was 19.85 (9.94) years. Highest quartile FAI was associated with higher pulse wave velocity (β [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.009 [0.000 to 0.018]). Highest quartile dehydroepiandrosterone [β (95% CI), -0.008 (-0.015 to -0.001)] and androstenedione [β (95% CI), -0.010 (-0.017 to -0.003)] levels were associated with a lower IMT. We found no association between high androgen levels and incident stroke, CHD, or CVD.


Conclusion
Postmenopausal high androgen levels were not associated with an elevated risk for CVD. Cardiovascular health in women with PCOS might be better than was anticipated."	Cardiovascular Diseases	epidemiology
