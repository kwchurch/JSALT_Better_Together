0	24470723	5409261	Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in a child	Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare tumour arising from the vascular endothelium of soft-tissue, bone and viscera. Skin involvement is rare. The disease has an indolent course, with the potential for recurrence and often associated with multi-systemic localisations. We present a rare case of cutaneous EHE without systemic involvement in 9-year-old boy. The tumour was completely excised and histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with EHE. Complete systemic assessment showed no internal localisation. Wide excision is the mainstay of therapy and regular follow-up is suggested due to the potential for recurrence. The majority of documented cases of EHE is in adults and has developed in association with an underlying systemic involvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case of isolated cutaneous EHE in paediatric age group.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
1	12052256	1399765	Mutation analysis of the CHK2 gene in breast carcinoma and other cancers	Mutations in the CHK2 gene at chromosome 22q12.1 have been reported in families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Chk2 is an effector kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage and is involved in cell-cycle pathways and p53 pathways. We screened 139 breast tumors for loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 22q, using seven microsatellite markers, and screened 119 breast tumors with single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing for mutations in the CHK2 gene. Seventy-four of 139 sporadic breast tumors (53%) show loss of heterozygosity with at least one marker. These samples and 45 tumors from individuals carrying the BRCA2 999del5 mutation were screened for mutations in the CHK2 gene. In addition to putative polymorphic regions in short mononucleotide repeats in a non-coding exon and intron 2, a germ line variant (T59K) in the first coding exon was detected. On screening 1172 cancer patients for the T59K sequence variant, it was detected in a total of four breast-cancer patients, two colon-cancer patients, one stomach-cancer patient and one ovary-cancer patient, but not in 452 healthy individuals. A tumor-specific 5' splice site mutation at site +3 in intron 8 (TTgt [a --> c]atg) was also detected. We conclude that somatic CHK2 mutations are rare in breast cancer, but our results suggest a tumor suppressor function for CHK2 in a small proportion of breast tumors. Furthermore, our results suggest that the T59K CHK2 sequence variant is a low-penetrance allele with respect to tumor growth.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
2	32607550	220283995	Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the lung: CT findings and clinical course of 35 cases	To evaluate computed tomography findings and assess the clinical course of patients with pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Patients diagnosed with pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma at our institution between 2000 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with pleural involvement were excluded. Computed tomography findings of the lung at diagnosis were classified into three patterns: multiple small nodules pattern (˂15 mm), multiple nodules with large lesions pattern (≥15 mm) and single lesion pattern. Additionally, the clinical course of patients was evaluated. Thirty-five patients (15 men and 20 women; median age, 44 years) with pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma were identified. The multiple small nodules pattern, multiple nodules with large lesions pattern and single lesion pattern were observed in 25 (71.4%), 8 (22.9%) and 2 (5.7%) patients, respectively. In 22 (62.9%) patients, extra-pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma lesions were found. Most patients were followed without initial treatment, while two patients with single lesion pattern underwent surgical resection. The median follow-up period was 63 months. Five-year overall survival rate of all patients was 96.3%. Latest clinical information revealed that 20 (20/25, 80%) patients with multiple small nodules pattern were alive without symptoms. In patients with multiple nodules with large lesion pattern, four (4/8, 50%) patients were alive without symptoms, three (3/8, 37.5%) patients were alive with symptoms and one (1/8, 12.5%) died. No recurrence was observed in patients with single lesion pattern. Multiple small nodules pattern was the most common findings of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Patients with pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma have good prognosis.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
3	21499150	15187628	Sequentially staged resection and 2-column reconstruction for C2 tumors through a combined anterior retropharyngeal-posterior approach: surgical technique and results in 11 patients	Surgical treatment of C2 tumors remains challenging. Because of the deep location and unique anatomical complexity, anterior exposure in this region is considered difficult and dangerous, and few reports concerning anterior tumor resection and reconstruction exist. To describe a technique of sequentially staged resection and 2-column reconstruction for C2 tumors through a combined anterior retropharyngeal-posterior approach. Eleven patients with C2 tumors underwent sequentially staged tumor resection and 2-column reconstruction in our institute. Eight primary lesions and 3 metastases were involved. Tumor resections and anterior reconstructions with conventional constructs were accomplished by an anterior retropharyngeal approach, and occipitocervical fusions through posterior access were performed in the same anesthesia. No operative mortality occurred in this series. All patients experienced pain relief and neurological improvement after surgery. Except for 1 incidence of screw pullout, which was corrected by revision surgery, solid fusion was achieved in all patients. A follow-up period of 12 to 37 months was available for this study. Two patients with chordoma relapsed; 1 died of disease, and the other was alive with disease. Two patients with metastasis died of multiple remote metastases. No evidence of local recurrence was found in the other patients. The anterior retropharyngeal approach is a favorable route to treat tumor lesions of the C2 vertebral body that allows tumor resection and placement of anterior constructs between C1 and the subaxial vertebral body. Tumor resection and 2-column reconstruction could safely be accomplished simultaneously through the combined anterior retropharyngeal-posterior approach.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3

5	31741105	208086777	Surgical workflow for fully navigated high sacral amputation in sacral chordoma	The method of choice for treatment of sacral chordomas is en bloc tumor removal via sacrectomy or sacral amputation in varying degrees depending on the initial tumor extent. Besides local tumor control, the preservation of neurological function is equally important to minimize postoperative bladder and bowel dysfunction. Removal of sacral tumors is complicated by the complex regional anatomy of the pelvis and the surrounding visceral and retroperitoneal structures. We aim to describe the surgical workflow for a fully navigated high sacral amputation facilitated by integration of an intraoperative computed tomography (iCT)-based spinal navigation system. An iCT-based spinal navigation system (AIRO® CT scanner, Brainlab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) was used to perform intraoperative navigation with an image-guidance system and infrared tracking camera (BrainLab CurveTM, Brainlab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) in combination with the spinal navigation set by Brainlab (Brainlab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany) to perform a fully navigated high sacral amputation. We demonstrate the successful implementation of iCT-based spinal navigation during high sacral amputation and the key advantages of this technique throughout the surgery. iCT-based spinal navigation is a useful complementing technique for en bloc high sacral amputations that renders the surgery safer and more accurate.

6	18073294	37415820	Evaluation of [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA positron emission tomography-computed tomography for surgery in focal congenital hyperinsulinism	In congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), the identification and precise localization of a focal lesion is essential for successful surgery. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive value and accuracy of integrated [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA ([18F]FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) for the surgical therapy of CHI. This was an observational study. The study was performed in the Department of Pediatric Surgery at a university hospital. From February 2005 to September 2007, 10 children with the clinical signs of CHI and an increased radiotracer uptake in a circumscribed area of the pancreas in the [18F]FDOPA PET-CT were evaluated. Guided by the [18F]FDOPA PET-CT report, all children underwent partial pancreatic resection, in two cases twice. Correlation of the anatomical findings at surgery with the report of the [18F]FDOPA PET-CT, and the results of surgery and clinical outcome were determined. In nine children the intraoperative situation corresponded exactly to the description of the [18F]FDOPA PET-CT. A limited resection of the pancreas was curative in eight cases at the first surgery, in one case at the second intervention. We observed no diabetes mellitus or exocrine insufficiency in the follow up so far. In one child, hypoglycemia persisted even after two partial resections of the pancreatic head. Histological analysis finally revealed an atypical intermediate form of CHI. The integrated [18F]FDOPA PET-CT is accurate to localize the lesion in focal CHI and is a valuable tool to guide the surgeon in limited pancreatic resection.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3
7	32180040	212719059	FDG PET/CT used in identifying adult-onset Still’s disease in connective tissue diseases	To explore the 18F-fluoro-dexoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) imaging characteristics of adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and its significance in differential diagnosis from other connective tissue diseases (CTDs). FDG PET/CT images of 54 patients with AOSD and 66 with other CTD from patients suffering from fever of unknown origin (FUO) were retrospectively studied and compared with 40 healthy controls. Clinical and PET/CT characteristics of AOSD and other CTDs were compared, and SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake value) was used to analyze the differences of FDG uptake in the blood pool, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and hyperplastic lymph nodes between the AOSD and other CTDs. The SUVmax ratios of the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes to the liver were used to establish the diagnostic criteria for differential diagnosis of AOSD, and its diagnostic efficiency was evaluated. Positive findings are presented in 53/54 (98.1%) AOSD patients and 61/66 (92.4%) other CTD patients in PET/CT imaging. AOSD manifested as diffusely increased FDG uptake in the spleen and bone marrow, and multiple reactive hyperplasia lymph nodes are symmetrically distributed mainly in the neck and axilla, while other organs were seldom involved. Although these abnormalities could be seen in other CTDs, its incidence and uptake value were both higher in AOSD. If two or more of the following three standard were met, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diagnosing AOSD could reach 90.7%, 92.4%, and 91.7%, respectively: ① spleen SUVmax/liver SUVmax ≥ 1.2 and/or bone marrow SUVmax/liver SUVmax ≥ 1.4; ②symmetrically distributed reactive hyperplastic lymph nodes mainly in the neck and axilla with a lymph node SUVmax/liver SUVmax ≥ 1.8; and ③ no other abnormal uptake found in other organs. Characteristic manifestations in AOSD were found on FDG PET/CT. These findings could help to identify AOSD from the other CTDs, especially in cases of fever of unknown origin, where it can assist in identifying the cause. Key Points • Image characteristics of FDG PET/CT in adult-onset Still’s disease were described. • FDG PET/CT helps in identifying adult-onset Still’s disease from the other connective tissue diseases. • FDG PET/CT imaging standard for diagnosing adult-onset Still’s disease were established.

8	19436707	14225730	Multipotent genetic suppression of retrotransposon-induced mutations by Nxf1 through fine-tuning of alternative splicing	Cellular gene expression machinery has coevolved with molecular parasites, such as viruses and transposons, which rely on host cells for their expression and reproduction. We previously reported that a wild-derived allele of mouse Nxf1 (Tap), a key component of the host mRNA nuclear export machinery, suppresses two endogenous retrovirus-induced mutations and shows suggestive evidence of positive selection. Here we show that Nxf1(CAST) suppresses a specific and frequent class of intracisternal A particle (IAP)-induced mutations, including Ap3d1(mh2J), a model for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and Atcay(hes), an orthologous gene model for Cayman ataxia, among others. The molecular phenotype of suppression includes approximately two-fold increase in the level of correctly-spliced mRNA and a decrease in mutant-specific, alternatively-processed RNA accumulating from the inserted allele. Insertional mutations involving ETn and LINE elements are not suppressed, demonstrating a high degree of specificity to this suppression mechanism. These results implicate Nxf1 in some instances of pre-mRNA processing, demonstrate the useful range of Nxf1(CAST) alleles for manipulating existing mouse models of disease, and specifically imply a low functional threshold for therapeutic benefit in Cayman ataxia.

9	8408136	216127153	Operative treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma	A review of twenty-one cases. Between 1972 and 1992, twenty-one patients had a primary operation for the treatment of a sacrococcygeal chordoma; seventeen had had a diagnostic biopsy elsewhere. The average age at the time of the operation was fifty-five years (range, six to seventy-eight years); fourteen patients were male and seven were female. In all patients, a posterior approach was used, even for resections at the cephalic levels of the sacrum. In addition, sixteen of the twenty-one patients were treated with adjuvant radiation therapy. Four patients died; three died of metastatic chordoma. Of the remaining seventeen patients, fifteen were apparently free of disease and had not had a local recurrence at the time of the latest follow-up examination. The average duration of follow-up for these fifteen patients was four and one-half years. Of the nine patients who were followed for at least five years, seven were disease-free at the latest follow-up evaluation. Of the seven patients in whom both second sacral roots were the most caudad nerve-roots spared, four had normal bladder control and five had normal bowel control. Of the four patients in whom the most caudad nerve-roots spared were the first sacral or more cephalic roots, all had impaired bladder control, one had impaired bowel control, and three had a colostomy.

10	16198962	632447	Primary angiosarcoma of the lung	Primary angiosarcoma of the lung is a rare disorder with few cases reported in the literature [Patel AM, Ryu JH. Angiosarcoma in the lung. Chest 1993;103:1531-35]. We present a case of primary angiosarcoma of the lung in a 79-year-old woman. Preoperative computed tomographic scan revealed soft tissue nodules surrounded by a halo of ground-glass attenuation, an appearance consistent with hemorrhagic pulmonary nodules [Primack S, Hartman T, Lee KS. Pulmonary nodules and the CT halo sign. Radiology 1994;190:513-15]. Lung biopsy revealed a multifocal malignant neoplasm with areas of hemorrhage. The histologic, cytologic, and immunophenotypic features were characteristic of epithelioid angiosarcoma. This case report contributes to the sparse literature on this disease and provides computed tomographic and pathologic correlation in a patient with hemorrhagic pulmonary nodules.

11	21534334	26355735	Pediatric pulmonology in a developing country: our focus	This study was designed to determine the profile of our pediatric pulmonology unit in Turkey, a developing country, by investigating the patients admitted to our unit for the first time. Our objectives were: to determine the profile of patients admitted for the first time, to compare their initial diagnoses before referral to our hospital with the diagnoses determined in our unit, to determine the definitive diagnoses for patients requiring advanced intervention with invasive diagnostic methods, and to follow the treatments, operations and invasive-noninvasive mechanical ventilation practices. With these objectives in mind, the records of 412 patients who visited the pediatric pulmonology clinic within a six-month period were reviewed. The referral diagnoses, consisting mostly of primary ciliary dyskinesia, recurrent lung infections caused by immune deficiency and bronchiectasis, as well as definitive diagnoses were recorded. Tuberculosis (14%), cystic fibrosis (7.8%), bronchiectasis (4.6%), immune deficiency (1.6%), hydatid cyst (2%), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (1%) were the most commonly diagnosed diseases. Final diagnosis in 145 of the 412 patients (35.2%) differed from the referral diagnosis. Consanguineous marriages are encountered more commonly in developing countries like Turkey, leading to an increased incidence of genetic diseases such as primary ciliary dysgenesis, cystic fibrosis and immune deficiencies. Infectious diseases such as hydatid cyst and tuberculosis are also common. In any country in which there is a unique distribution of diseases, in other words, a characteristic and unique disease spectrum, courses and instructional fellowship programs should be arranged accordingly.

12	24782230	13959302	Clinical delineation and natural history of the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum	Somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol/AKT/mTOR pathway cause segmental overgrowth disorders. Diagnostic descriptors associated with PIK3CA mutations include fibroadipose overgrowth (FAO), Hemihyperplasia multiple Lipomatosis (HHML), Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth, Vascular malformations, Epidermal nevi, Scoliosis/skeletal and spinal (CLOVES) syndrome, macrodactyly, and the megalencephaly syndrome, Megalencephaly-Capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome. We set out to refine the understanding of the clinical spectrum and natural history of these phenotypes, and now describe 35 patients with segmental overgrowth and somatic PIK3CA mutations. The phenotypic data show that these previously described disease entities have considerable overlap, and represent a spectrum. While this spectrum overlaps with Proteus syndrome (sporadic, mosaic, and progressive) it can be distinguished by the absence of cerebriform connective tissue nevi and a distinct natural history. Vascular malformations were found in 15/35 (43%) and epidermal nevi in 4/35 (11%) patients, lower than in Proteus syndrome. Unlike Proteus syndrome, 31/35 (89%) patients with PIK3CA mutations had congenital overgrowth, and in 35/35 patients this was asymmetric and disproportionate. Overgrowth was mild with little postnatal progression in most, while in others it was severe and progressive requiring multiple surgeries. Novel findings include: adipose dysregulation present in all patients, unilateral overgrowth that is predominantly left-sided, overgrowth that affects the lower extremities more than the upper extremities and progresses in a distal to proximal pattern, and in the most severely affected patients is associated with marked paucity of adipose tissue in unaffected areas. While the current data are consistent with some genotype-phenotype correlation, this cannot yet be confirmed.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
13	20602486	6402348	Creatine transporter deficiency in two half-brothers	X-linked cerebral creatine deficiency is caused by the deficiency of the creatine transporter encoded by the SLC6A8 gene. Here, we report two half-brothers with this condition and characterize creatine transport in human fibroblasts. The propositus presented at 6 months of age with delays in development and slow progress since then with no regression. Seizures started at 3.5 years of age and responded well to treatment with anticonvulsants. He had failure to thrive with all growth parameters (including head size) at or below the fifth centile. Brain MRI indicated hemispheric white matter abnormalities, while MR spectroscopy indicated markedly reduced creatine peak. Biochemical testing indicated increased urine creatine/creatinine ratio, with normal plasma creatine and guanidinoacetate. To confirm the diagnosis, we measured ([14])C-creatine transport in fibroblasts. ([14])C-Creatine transport in normal human fibroblasts was linear for up to 2 hr at 37 degrees C. Kinetic studies indicated the presence of a single saturable creatine transporter with a K(m) of 34.7 +/- 2.5 microM. Fibroblasts from the propositus lacked creatine transport. DNA testing indicated hemizygosity for a novel deletion producing a frameshift (c.974_975delCA, p.Thr325SerfsX139) in the creatine transporter gene. His 12-year-old half-brother had similar biochemical and clinical abnormalities except for the presence of macrocephaly and the absence of seizures. The mother had history of seizures in childhood, but had normal development. These results show that human fibroblasts have a single major creatine transporter and that measurement of its specific activity can confirm creatine transporter deficiency.

14	15459119	17151713	Pancreatic islet adaptation to fasting is dependent on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha transcriptional up-regulation of fatty acid oxidation	The cellular response to fasting and starvation in tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, and liver requires peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha)-dependent up-regulation of energy metabolism toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). PPARalpha null (PPARalphaKO) mice develop hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the fasting state, and we previously showed that PPARalpha expression is increased in islets at low glucose. On this basis, we hypothesized that enhanced PPARalpha expression and FAO, via depletion of lipid-signaling molecule(s) for insulin exocytosis, are also involved in the normal adaptive response of the islet to fasting. Fasted PPARalphaKO mice compared with wild-type mice had supranormal ip glucose tolerance due to increased plasma insulin levels. Isolated islets from the PPARalpha null mice had a 44% reduction in FAO, normal glucose use and oxidation, and enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion. In normal rats, fasting for 24 h increased islet PPARalpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and uncoupling protein-2 mRNA expression by 60%, 62%, and 82%, respectively. The data are consistent with the view that PPARalpha, via transcriptionally up-regulating islet FAO, can reduce insulin secretion, and that this mechanism is involved in the normal physiological response of the pancreatic islet to fasting such that hypoglycemia is avoided.

15	11685615	21205737	Histological study on local invasiveness of clival chordoma	Case report of autopsy. It is well known that clival chordomas invade bony structures; however, their invasiveness of other structures has rarely been reported. We report an autopsy case of clival chordoma in a 61-year-old woman, who underwent surgery 6 times for a period of 8 years, with special reference to its local invasiveness. The histological studies showed that the tumour grew in the loose connective tissue in multilayers or multilobular fashion, invading the submucous layer in addition to the bone; however, it did not invade other soft tissue, particularly vital neurovascular structures or the dura itself, even in the advanced stage. The dura may serve as a strong barrier against tumour invasion into the intradural space, which emphasises the importance of not injuring the dura, when the tumour is removed extradurally. For radical removal of clival chordoma, it will be necessary to remove the tumour extensively including normal bone and soft tissues surrounding the tumour, especially the mucous membrane, because the normal mucous membrane is surgically difficult to preserve by dissecting it from the invaded submucous layer.

17	28991683	29944288	A new PLA2G6 mutation in a family with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy	Phospholipase A2-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN), a syndrome of Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA), is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in PLA2G6 gene. This gene encodes a calcium-independent group VI phospholipase A2 (iPLA-VI) critical in cell membrane homeostasis. PLAN syndrome encompasses a group of phenotypes with a different age of onset: classic infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy of childhood-onset (atypical NAD) and adult-onset PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism (PARK14). INAD is a severe progressive psychomotor disorder characterized by the presence of axonal spheroids throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. Here we report clinical, genetic and histopathological findings of an INAD consanguineous-family from Senegal. Sanger sequencing analysis revealed a new homozygous PLA2G6-mutation in the proband (c.1483C>T) and the co-segregation of the mutation in this family. Electron microscopy on skin biopsy showed degenerated axons confirming the phenotype. This study contributes to enrich the landscape of PLA2G6-associated INAD mutations and enforce the genotype-phenotype correlation.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
18	26288526	41887516	Pediatric multifocal liver lesions evaluated by MRI	The purpose of this study is to present our experience with MRI evaluation of multifocal liver lesions in children and describe the MRI characteristics of these lesions. A retrospective review of consecutive MRI exams performed for the evaluation of multiple liver lesions between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012 was done to note the number of lesions, the size of the largest lesion, MR signal characteristics, and background liver. Final diagnosis was assigned to each case based on pathology in the available cases and a combination of clinical features, imaging features, and follow-up in the remaining cases. A total of 48 children (22 boys, 26 girls; age between 3 months and 18 years with average age 10.58 years and median age 11 years) were included in the study. Totally 51 lesion diagnoses were seen in 48 children that included 17 focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), 8 hemangiomas, 7 metastases, 6 regenerative nodules, 3 adenomas, 3 abscesses, and one each of angiomyolipoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, focal fatty infiltration, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic infarction, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and hepatic cyst. Background liver was normal in 33, cirrhotic in 10, fatty in 3, and siderotic in 2 children. Most FNH, hemangiomas, and regenerative nodules showed characteristic MRI features, while metastases were variable in signal pattern. Many commonly seen multifocal liver lesions in children have characteristic MRI features. MRI can help to arrive at reasonable differential diagnoses for multifocal liver lesions in children and guide further investigation and management.

19	33243178	227180162	Two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene in primary ciliary dyskinesia (CILD7) with considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype	Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) still remains a challenge, especially with mutations in the Dynein Arm Heavy Chain 11 (DNAH11) gene. Classical diagnostic measures like Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) are not applicable for mutations in the DNAH11 gene since ultrastructural defects of the ciliary apparatus are absent. Novel mutations encoding for PCD appear all the time with considerable variation in the clinical picture, making it necessary to update data bases and guidelines for PCD diagnostics. In this study we examined two unrelated, Finnish families with symptoms of PCD applying the clinical scoring system: Primary ciliary dyskinesia Rule (PICADAR), high speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA) for ciliary movement, a commercially available gene panel analysis and nasal Nitric Oxide (nNO) measurements if applicable. Two, likely pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) ja c.7645 + 5G > A) were detected. In the first family, compound heterozygous mutations led to disease manifestation in two of 4 children, which showed a similar phenotype of cilia beating pattern but marked differences in disease severity. In the second family, all three children were homozygotes for the c.2341G > A p.(Glu781Lys) mutation and showed a similar degree of disease severity. However, the phenotype of cilia beating pattern was different ranging from stiff, static cilia to a hyperkinetic movement in one of these children. In this study we describe two Finnish families with PCD, revealing two novel mutations in the DNAH11 gene which show considerable variety in the clinical and beating cilia phenotype. The results of this study show the clinician that PCD can be much milder than generally expected and diagnosis demands a combination of measures which are only successful in experienced hands. Chronic and repeatedly treated wet cough should raise suspicion of PCD, referring the patient for further diagnostics to a specialised PCD centre.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

21	17039144	23505375	Worsening of macrophage activation syndrome in a patient with adult onset Still's disease after initiation of etanercept therapy	The macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare, potentially fatal, clinical syndrome, which has been described in childhood rheumatic disorders. MAS is defined by a prolonged period of fevers, pancytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia (with or without hypofibrinogenemia). Histopathological examination of bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes shows hemophagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes. In patients with Still's disease, observed triggering events for MAS have included both infectious processes and pharmacological agents, such as parenteral gold and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report the case of a young woman with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), complicated by an Epstein-Barr virus infection and subsequent MAS, whose course worsened after administration of the soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor, etanercept. Subsequent treatment with pulse corticosteroids and cyclosporine A induced a dramatic clinical improvement. Treatment data regarding the use of etanercept in AOSD are lacking; given our experience and recent reports in children with Still's disease, we would suggest caution using this agent in patients with AOSD, particularly when complicated by MAS.

Patients are often diagnosed according to the presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other tumors in the brain and spinal cord. In children, NF2 can present early with ocular findings and cutaneous tumors. We report here a 9-year-old girl who presented with multiple pigmented, slightly tender plaques on her scalp, face, and back that were revealed by histopathology to be plexiform schwannomas. We suspected NF2 and sent the patient's blood for genetic testing, which confirmed our diagnosis.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
23	26799970	1801503	Whole-Body Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis in Children	Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis/ chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CRMO/ CNO) is a rare auto-inflammatory disease and typically manifests in terms of musculoskeletal pain. Because of a high frequency of musculoskeletal disorders in children/ adolescents, it can be quite challenging to distinguish CRMO/ CNO from nonspecific musculoskeletal pain or from malignancies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the visibility of CRMO lesions in a whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI) technique and its potential clinical value to better characterize MR-visible lesions. Whole-body imaging at 3T was performed in 16 patients (average: 13 years) with confirmed CRMO. The protocol included 2D Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) imaging in coronal and axial orientation as well as diffusion-weighted imaging in axial orientation. Visibility of lesions in DWI and STIR was evaluated by two readers in consensus. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured for every lesion and corresponding reference locations. A total of 33 lesions (on average 2 per patient) visible in STIR and DWI images (b = 800 s/mm2 and ADC maps) were included, predominantly located in the long bones. With a mean value of 1283 mm2/s in lesions, the ADC was significantly higher than in corresponding reference regions (782 mm2/s). By calculating the ratio (lesion to reference), 82% of all lesions showed a relative signal increase of 10% or higher and 76% (25 lesions) showed a signal increase of more than 15%. The median relative signal increase was 69%. This study shows that WB-DWI can be reliably performed in children at 3T and predominantly, the ADC values were substantially elevated in CRMO lesions. WB-DWI in conjunction with clinical data is seen as a promising technique to distinguish benign inflammatory processes (in terms of increased ADC values) from particular malignancies.

27	17040294	45693130	Unusual hemangioendothelioma of the liver with epithelioid morphology associated with marked eosinophilia: autopsy case	Vascular neoplasms characterized by epithelioid endothelial cells consist of several different entities from benignity to high-grade malignancy. Because of histological overlap between them, there is substantial difficulty in classifying them correctly. The present patient, a 33-year-old man, presented with hepatomegaly, striking eosinophilia and elevated serum interleukin-5 level. Biopsy and autopsy revealed an unusual epithelioid vascular tumor in the liver, which is histologically distinct from epithelioid hemangioma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, or epithelioid angiosarcoma. The tumor cells had vasoformative and partly solid growth with no severe nuclear atypia and very low mitotic activity, and the histological features were similar to those of the entity recognized as hemangioendothelioma of bone. Organs other than the liver, for example the testes and bone, were also involved. This tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe eosinophilia.

28	11477711	43453332	Spindle-cell lesions of the liver: diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration biopsy	Rarely, spindle-cell lesions in liver fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) are encountered. A retrospective review of our experience with lesions that are mesenchymal in origin or appearance was undertaken to elucidate the frequency and spectrum of these lesions. Image-guided liver FNABs performed over a 3-year period (n = 585) at our institution (1996-1998) were retrospectively evaluated. Cytologic smears, cell block preparations, and clinical follow-up of lesions with spindle-cell morphology were reviewed. Twenty-nine of 585 cases were of spindle-cell morphology (5%). Hemangiomas (n = 12, 41%) and metastatic sarcomas (n = 6, 21%) comprised the largest categories, followed by granulomatous inflammation (n = 3, 10%). Other cases included primary angiosarcoma and fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. The most frequent spindle-cell liver lesion encountered is hemangioma, followed by metastatic leiomyosarcoma and granulomatous hepatitis. Awareness of diagnostic possibilities, special attention to specimen adequacy, and use of ancillary procedures can maximize diagnostic yield.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
29	15361853	28520093	Alternative splicing and mutation status of CHEK2 in stage III breast cancer	The DNA damage checkpoint kinase, CHK2, promotes growth arrest or apoptosis through phosphorylating targets such as Cdc25A, Cdc25C, BRCA1, and p53. Both germline and somatic loss-of-function CHEK2 mutations occur in human tumours, the former linked to the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and the latter found in diverse types of sporadic malignancies. Here we examined the status of CHK2 by genetic and immunohistochemical analyses in 53 breast carcinomas previously characterized for TP53 status. We identified two CHEK2 mutants, 470T>C (Ile157Thr), and a novel mutation, 1368insA leading to a premature stop codon in exon 13. The truncated protein encoded by CHEK2 carrying the 1368insA was stable yet mislocalized to the cytoplasm in tumour sections and when ectopically expressed in cultured cells. Unexpectedly, we found CHEK2 to be subject to extensive alternative splicing, with some 90 splice variants detected in our tumour series. While all cancers expressed normal-length CHEK2 mRNA together with the spliced transcripts, we demonstrate and/or predict some of these splice variants to lack CHK2 function and/or localize aberrantly. We conclude that cytoplasmic sequestration may represent a novel mechanism to disable CHK2, and propose to further explore the significance of the complex splicing patterns of this tumour suppressor gene in oncogenesis.

30	32762495	221076359	Overexpression of Activin Receptor-Like Kinase 1 in Endothelial Cells Suppresses Development of Arteriovenous Malformations in Mouse Models Of Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia	Rationale: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in ENG, ALK1, or SMAD4. Since proteins from all three HHT genes are components of signal transduction of TGF-β family members, it has been hypothesized that HHT is a disease caused by defects in the ENG-ALK1-SMAD4 linear signaling. However, in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis is scarce. Objective: We tested this hypothesis and investigated the therapeutic effects and potential risks of induced-ALK1 or -ENG overexpression for HHT. Methods and Results: We generated a novel mouse allele (ROSA26Alk1) in which HA-tagged ALK1 and bicistronic eGFP expression are induced by Cre activity. We examined whether ALK1-overexpression (OE) using the ROSA26Alk1 allele could suppress the development of AVMs in wounded adult skin and developing retinas of Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. We also used a similar approach to investigate whether ENG-OE could rescue AVMs. Biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the Cre-dependent overexpression of the ALK1-HA transgene. We could not detect any pathological signs in ALK1-OE mice up to 3 months after induction. ALK1-OE prevented the development of retinal AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs in Eng-iKO as well as Alk1-iKO mice. ALK1-OE normalized expression of SMAD and NOTCH target genes in ENG-deficient endothelial cells (ECs) and restored the effect of BMP9 on suppression of phosphor-AKT levels in these ECs. On the other hand, ENG-OE could not inhibit the AVM development in Alk1-iKO models. Conclusions: These data support the notion that ENG and ALK1 form a linear signaling pathway for the formation of a proper arteriovenous network during angiogenesis. We suggest that ALK1 overexpression or activation can be an effective therapeutic strategy for HHT1 and HHT2 in Alk1- and Eng-inducible knockout (iKO) mice. Further research is required to study whether this therapy could be translated into treatment for humans.	Gold Standard	disease mechanism	2
31	7513548	33731088	Abnormalities of chromosome 22 in pediatric meningiomas	Cytogenetic studies of eight meningiomas in young children or adolescents were performed. Two tumors exhibited normal karyotypes. Two tumors from patients with bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis demonstrated monosomy 22 as the only abnormality. Four patients had more complicated karyotypes in which one or both of the chromosomes 22 were missing or structurally altered. The most common secondary changes in these four tumors involved monosomy or structural abnormalities of chromosome 6. These findings confirm that the primary cytogenetic changes in meningioma are similar in children and adults. Molecular analyses of pediatric meningiomas with deletions or translocations of chromosome 22 will be useful for identifying the role of chromosome 22 tumor suppressor genes in this disease.

32	11498785	24412842	Relative frequency and morphology of cancers in carriers of germline TP53 mutations	The spectrum and frequency of cancers associated with germline TP53 mutations are uncertain. To address this issue a cohort of individuals from 28 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, segregating germline TP53 mutations was established. Predicted cancers were estimated by applying age, morphology, site and sex-specific UK cancer statistics to person-years at risk. Observed and predicted cancers were compared and two-sided P-values calculated. Cancer types occurring to excess and showing P-values <0.02, were designated strongly associated with germline TP53 mutations. These were removed from the data and a second round of analyses performed. Cancer types with P-values <0.02 and 0.02-0.05 in the second round analyses were considered moderately and weakly associated respectively. Strongly associated cancers were: breast carcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcoma, brain tumours, adrenocortical carcinoma, Wilms' tumour and phyllodes tumour. Carcinoma of pancreas was moderately associated. Leukaemia and neuroblastoma were weakly associated. Other common carcinomas including lung, colon, bladder, prostate, cervix and ovary did not occur to excess. Although breast carcinoma and sarcomas were numerically most frequent, the greatest increases relative to general population rates were in adrenocortical carcinoma and phyllodes tumour. We conclude that germline TP53 mutations do not simply increase general cancer risk. There are tissue-specific effects.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
33	27504264	10559537	Atypical benign partial epilepsy of childhood with acquired neurocognitive, lexical semantic, and autistic spectrum disorder	Atypical benign partial epilepsy (ABPE) of childhood or pseudo-Lennox syndrome is a form of idiopathic focal epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure types, focal and/or generalized epileptiform discharges, continuous spike-wave during sleep (CSWS), and sometimes reversible neurocognitive deficits. There are few reported cases of ABPE describing detailed correlative longitudinal follow-up of the various associated neurocognitive, language, social communicative, or motor deficits, in parallel with the epilepsy. Furthermore, the molecular inheritance pattern for ABPE and the wider spectrum of epilepsy aphasia disorders have yet to be fully elucidated. We describe the phenotype-genotype study of a boy with ABPE with follow-up from ages 5 to 13 years showing acquired oromotor and, later, a specific lexical semantic and pervasive developmental disorder. Exome sequencing identified variants in SCN9A, CPA6, and SCNM1. A direct role of the epilepsy in the pathogenesis of the oromotor and neurocognitive deficits is apparent.

34	11477212	22075162	Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS): methylxanthines potentiate GLUT1 haploinsufficiency in vitro	Methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline are known to inhibit glucose transport. We have studied such inhibition in the glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS) by erythrocyte glucose transport assays. Data from four patients with individual mutations in the GLUT1 gene are discussed: patient 1 (hemizygosity), 3 (S66F), 15 (368Ins23), and 17 (R333W). Zero-trans influx of (14)C-labeled 3-O-methyl glucose (3-OMG) into erythrocytes of patients is reduced (patient 1, 51%; 3, 45%; 15, 31%; 17, 52%) compared with maternal controls. Inhibition studies on patients 1, 3, 17, and maternal controls show an IC(50) for caffeine of approximately 1.5 mM both in controls (n = 3) and patients (n = 3) at 5 mM 3-OMG concentration. In the same two groups, kinetic studies show that 3 mM caffeine significantly decreases V(max) (p < 0.005), whereas the decrease in K(m) is significant (p < 0.01) only in the three controls and one patient (patient 3). Kinetic data from individual patients permit us to speculate that the interactions between caffeine and Glut1 are influenced by the mutation. Three mM caffeine also inhibits the transport of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), another substrate for Glut1. The combined effects of caffeine (3 mM) and phenobarbital (10 mM) on glucose transport, as determined in patient 15 and the maternal control, show no additive or synergistic inhibition. These data indicate that caffeine and phenobarbital have similar Glut1 inhibitory properties in these two subjects. Our study suggests that Glut1DS patients may have a reduced safety margin for methylxanthines. Consumption of methylxanthine-containing products may aggravate the neurologic symptoms associated with the Glut1DS.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
35	30607672	57427589	TP53 germline mutation testing in early-onset breast cancer: findings from a nationwide cohort	Early-onset breast cancer may be due to Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Current national and international guidelines recommend that TP53 genetic testing should be considered for women with breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 31 years. However, large studies investigating TP53 mutation prevalence in this population are scarce. We collected nationwide laboratory records for all young breast cancer patients tested for TP53 mutations in the Netherlands. Between 2005 and 2016, 370 women diagnosed with breast cancer younger than 30 years of age were tested for TP53 germline mutations, and eight (2.2%) were found to carry a (likely) pathogenic TP53 sequence variant. Among BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation negative women without a family history suggestive of LFS or a personal history of multiple LFS-related tumours, the TP53 mutation frequency was < 1% (2/233). Taking into consideration that TP53 mutation prevalence was comparable or even higher in some studies selecting patients with breast cancer onset at older ages or HER2-positive breast cancers, raises the question of whether a very early age of onset is an appropriate single TP53 genetic testing criterion.

36	28089540	205150062	Aberrant CDX2 expression in hepatocellular carcinomas: an important diagnostic pitfall	CDX2 is a sensitive and specific marker of intestinal differentiation. It is routinely used in surgical pathology, as its expression within a tumor favors an origin within the gastrointestinal tract. We had anecdotally encountered occasional hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) that were CDX2 positive. CDX2 expression in HCC has not yet been reported, but it has also not been examined in detail. Therefore, we evaluated CDX2 expression in a large number of resected HCCs. Full tumor sections from 172 resected HCCs and 6 resected fibrolamellar carcinomas (FLCs) were stained for CDX2. Nine (5.2%) of 172 HCCs were positive for CDX2, whereas all 6 FLCs were negative. CDX2 expression in HCCs was more commonly seen in poorly differentiated tumors (5 of 16 cases, 31%) than well and moderately differentiated tumors (4 of 156 cases, 2.5%), P = .0004. No other statistically significant correlations were observed (P>.05). Results of our study show that a small subset (5%) of HCCs can be CDX2 positive. Awareness of this phenomenon is important because CDX2 expression in a liver tumor does not completely exclude a diagnosis of HCC.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
37	18037933	19332343	Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis: what is it and how should it be treated?	Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is the most severe form of chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis. In children and adolescents, chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis predominantly affects the metaphyses of the long bones, but lesions can occur at any site in the skeleton. Other organs (the skin, eyes, gastrointestinal tract and lungs) can also be affected. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult because the symptoms and course of disease vary significantly. We present a 10-year-old girl diagnosed with CRMO involving several vertebrae, the femur and the metatarsus. Physical examination, abdominal ultra sonography, conventional X-ray, MRI, technetium bone scan, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, tests for HLA-B27 and thiopurine methyltransferase, polymerase chain reaction and thoracic vertebral bone biopsies. CRMO and Crohn's disease. The patient's condition improved whilst being treated with NSAIDs for 3 months; however, the patient had an allergic skin reaction to this therapy. Treatment was switched to sulfasalazine, accompanied by 3 weeks of therapy using oral prednisone, but sulfasalazine was discontinued 2 months later because the patient exhibited a minor elevation in the levels of liver enzymes. The patient was free of musculoskeletal symptoms for 6 months, at which time she started to complain again about pain in her back and bowel. Multimodal therapy, consisting of mesasalazine, corticosteroids (budesonide) and azathioprine, induced clinical remission of Crohn's disease.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
38	18558633	18586884	Als2 mRNA splicing variants detected in KO mice rescue severe motor dysfunction phenotype in Als2 knock-down zebrafish	Recessive ALS2 mutations are linked to three related but slightly different neurodegenerative disorders: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary spastic paraplegia and primary lateral sclerosis. To investigate the function of the ALS2 encoded protein, we generated Als2 knock-out (KO) mice and zAls2 knock-down zebrafish. The Als2(-/-) mice lacking exon 2 and part of exon 3 developed mild signs of neurodegeneration compatible with axonal transport deficiency. In contrast, zAls2 knock-down zebrafish had severe developmental abnormalities, swimming deficits and motor neuron perturbation. We identified, by RT-PCR, northern and western blotting novel Als2 transcripts in mouse central nervous system. These Als2 transcripts were present in Als2 null mice as well as in wild-type littermates and some rescued the zebrafish phenotype. Thus, we speculate that the newly identified Als2 mRNA species prevent the Als2 KO mice from developing severe neurodegenerative disease and might also regulate the severity of the motor neurons phenotype observed in ALS2 patients.

Patients with sterile osteitis were analysed to develop diagnostic criteria. A total of 89 patients with non-bacterial inflammatory bone lesions were observed for a median of 49 months. History, diagnostic imaging, laboratory and histological data were obtained. Mutation analysis in the genes PSTPIP1 and PSTPIP2 was performed. Patients had an onset of disease at a median age of 10 yrs [interquartile range (IQR) 7.5-12] and suffered a median period of 21 (IQR 9-52) months with a median of three foci per patient. Twenty percent of all the patients demonstrated associated autoimmune disorders, particularly of the skin and bowel. The majority of bone lesions were located in the vertebrae and metaphyses. Slight-to-moderate elevation of inflammation values were found in all the patients and antinuclear antibodies were elevated in 30%. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were effective in 85% of the patients. HLA-B27 and Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR)-classification did not differ from the general population. Autoimmune diseases in 40% of all the families, multiply affected family members, linkage to 18q21 and mouse models strongly indicate a genetic basis for NBO. We observed three different courses of disease regarding the duration of complaints, rate of complications and associated autoimmune manifestations leading to a new classification of NBO. Clinical analysis of our cohort leads us to define NBO as a distinct disease entity with three clinical presentations: acute NBO, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis or persistent chronic NBO. Diagnostic criteria were proposed to differentiate NBO from diseases with similar clinical presentation.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

We treated a 47-year-old male who had HHT, severe epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding, alcoholic cirrhosis, and portal hypertension with intravenous bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. We tabulated these measures weekly during weeks 1-33 (no bevacizumab); 34-57 (bevacizumab); and 58-97 (no bevacizumab): hemoglobin (Hb) levels; platelet counts; units of transfused packed erythrocytes (PRBC units); and quantities of iron infused as iron dextran to support erythropoiesis. We performed univariate and multivariable analyses. We sequenced his ENG and ACVRL1 genes. Epistaxis and melena decreased markedly during bevacizumab treatment. He reported no adverse effects due to bevacizumab. Mean weekly Hb levels were significantly higher and mean weekly PRBC units and quantities of intravenous iron were significantly lower during bevacizumab treatment. We performed a multiple regression on weekly Hb levels using these independent variables: bevacizumab treatment (dichotomous); weekly platelet counts; weekly PRBC units; and weekly quantities of intravenous iron. There was 1 positive association: (bevacizumab treatment; p = 0.0046) and 1 negative association (PRBC units; p = 0.0004). This patient had the novel ENG mutation E137K (exon 4; c.409G→A). Intravenous bevacizumab treatment 2.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks was well-tolerated by a patient with HHT due to ENG E137K and was associated with higher weekly Hb levels and fewer weekly PRBC units.

Primary defects in the structure and function of sensory and motile cilia result in multiple ciliopathies. The most prominent genetic abnormality involving motile cilia is primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or Kartageners syndrome. PCD is a rare, usually autosomal recessive, genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by sino-pulmonary disease, laterality defects and male infertility. One of the important components of cilia is the Dynein. Ciliary ultrastructural defects are identified in approximately 90% of PCD patients and involve the outer dynein arms, inner dynein arms, or both. Diagnosing PCD is challenging and requires a compatible clinical phenotype together with tests such as ciliary ultrastructural analysis, immunofluorescent staining, ciliary beat assessment, and/or nasal nitric oxide measurements. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis will aid in better diagnosis and treatment of PCD. The aim of the article is to present the basic defect involved in the etiology of this interesting syndrome.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

In this study we analysed a series of cases of idiopathic and cryptogenic epilepsy attended by the Neuropaediatric Department of the Hospital Miguel Servet in Zaragoza (Spain). We studied the cases diagnosed as having idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy between May 1990 and December 1999. We assessed 4,507 children. In 1,794 (39.8%) consultation was for a paroxystic disorder. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 466 children (10.3%) and 103 cases were considered possibly or probably epilepsy but the diagnosis remains in doubt (2.3%). In 111 cases (23.8%) the epilepsy was considered idiopathic, in 122 (26.2%) cryptogenic and in 233 cases (50%) symptomatic. The following epileptic syndromes were identified: epilepsy-absence attacks in 28 cases (6%), benign myoclonic infantile epilepsy in 4 cases, other idiopathic generalized epilepsies in 61 cases (13%), benign Rolandic epilepsy in 18 cases (3.9%), 2 cases of cryptogenic Ohtahara syndrome, 6 cases of cryptogenic West syndrome, 1 severe case of infantile myoclonic epilepsy, 1 case of continuous wave epilepsy during slow eye movement sleep and 1 case of Landau-Kleffner syndrome.

46	16799054	28245381	Ames Waltzer deaf mice have reduced electroretinogram amplitudes and complex alternative splicing of Pcdh15 transcripts.	"PURPOSE
Mutations of PCDH15, the gene encoding protocadherin 15, cause either nonsyndromic deafness DFNB23 or Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F) in humans and deafness with balance problems in Ames waltzer (av) mice. Persons with USH1 usually begin to exhibit signs of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in early adolescence, but av mice are reported to have functional retinas. In this study, the auditory, visual and molecular biological phenotype of Pcdh15av-5J and Pcdh15av-Jfb mice is characterized, and their usefulness as animal models of USH1 is evaluated.


METHODS
Hearing thresholds of mice between 6 and 10 weeks of age were measured by auditory brain stem response (ABR). Immunohistochemistry and histology were used to examine the effect of homozygosity of Pcdh15av-5J on stereocilia bundles of inner ear hair cells and on the photoreceptor cells of the retina. Scotopic and photopic Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded from homozygous Pcdh15av-5J and Pcdh15av-Jfb mice at different ages. Heterozygous littermates served as control subjects. Measurements of the width of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the length of rod photoreceptor outer segment (ROS) were made.


RESULTS
Homozygous Pcdh15av-5J mice have profound hearing loss and disorganized stereocilia bundles of inner ear hair cells. Compared with heterozygous littermates, homozygous Pcdh15av-5J and Pcdh15av-Jfb mutant mice had scotopic ERG amplitudes consistently reduced by approximately 40% at all light intensities. The b-to-a-wave ratio confirmed that the a- and b-waves were reduced proportionally in homozygous mutant mice. Histologic measurements of retinal sections revealed no significant differences in either the ONL width or the ROS length as a function of genotype. The protocadherin 15 labeling pattern with antisera PB303 in the retina of both heterozygous and homozygous Pcdh15av-5J mice was indistinguishable from the wild type. Wild-type Pcdh15 have many alternatively spliced isoforms. A novel isoform was found in the retina of homozygous Pcdh15av-5J mice, which appears to circumvent the effect of the mutant allele (IVS14-2A-->G), which causes skipping of exon 14, a shift in the translation reading frame and a premature stop codon in exon 15.


CONCLUSIONS
Pcdh15(av-5J) and Pcdh15(av-Jfb) mice do not faithfully mimic the RP found in USH1 due to mutations of PCDH15, but have significantly attenuated ERG function in the absence of histologic change. The decline in ERG amplitude with a preserved b-to-a-wave ratio suggests a role for Pcdh15 in retinal function and/or generation of the ERG potentials. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which av mice circumvent degeneration of the retina might offer insights into potential therapies for USH1."	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
47	27925453	3267523	Chest computed tomography scores in patients with cystic fibrosis colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus	Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF), with increasing incidence in recent years. We examined the association between bacterial colonization in the sputum (MRSA with or without pseudomonas (PA)) and computed tomography (CT) scores in CF patients. MRSA patients were divided according to PA status based on at least three consecutive sputum cultures; controls were patients without MRSA (with or without PA), matched for gender and age at CT. Clinical data and CT scores were compared between groups. Of 33 patients with MRSA, 14 had no PA (MRSA + PA-) and 19 had also PA (MRSA + PA+). MRSA + PA- and MRSA + PA+ patients had CT scores similar to their controls PA+ (38.25 ± 20.18 vs. 32.22 ± 18.74, P = .4, and 41.88 ± 18.18 vs. 45.33 ± 11.5, P = .4, respectively). Although MRSA + PA- had worse CT scores than their matched PA- controls, their mean FEV1 values were similar. Colonization with MRSA in CF is associated with structural CT changes at least similar to those in PA. A cause and effect relationship cannot be established. The current findings call for a larger study assessing longitudinally the impact of MRSA acquisition and eradication protocols.	Gold Standard	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
48	22940633	45184597	Attenuated TLR4/MAPK signaling in monocytes from patients with CRMO results in impaired IL-10 expression	Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory bone disorder of unknown origin. We previously demonstrated that monocytes from CRMO patients fail to express the immune-modulatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in a chromatin dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that attenuated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1 and 2 signaling in response to TLR4 activation results in failure to induce IL-10 expression in monocytes from CRMO patients. Attenuated ERK1/2 activation results in 1) reduced levels of Sp-1, a transcription factor that induces IL-10 expression in monocytes, and 2) impaired H3S10 phosphorylation of the IL10 promoter, an activating epigenetic mark. The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and IL-6 are not negatively affected, resulting in an imbalance towards pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, impaired ERK1/2 signaling with subsequently reduced Sp-1 expression and H3S10 phosphorylation of the IL10 promoter may centrally contribute to the pathophysiology of CRMO.

49	26099433	35070436	TDP-35 sequesters TDP-43 into cytoplasmic inclusions through binding with RNA	TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa) and its C-terminal fragments are thought to be linked to the pathologies of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that the aggregates or inclusions formed by its 35-kDa fragment (namely TDP-35) sequester full-length TDP-43 into cytoplasmic inclusions; and this sequestration is mediated by binding with RNA that is enriched in the cytoplasmic inclusions. RNA recognition motif 1 (RRM1) of TDP-43/TDP-35 plays a dominant role in nucleic-acid binding; mutation in this moiety abrogates formation of the TDP-35 inclusions and its RNA-assisted association with TDP-43. Thus, TDP-35 is able to sequester TDP-43 from nuclear localization into cytoplasmic inclusions, and RNA binding plays an essential role in this process.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
50	31545650	202746941	SPEF2-  and HYDIN -Mutant Cilia Lack the Central Pair-associated Protein SPEF2, Aiding Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Diagnostics	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous chronic destructive airway disease. PCD is traditionally diagnosed by nasal nitric oxide measurement, analysis of ciliary beating, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and/or genetic testing. In most genetic PCD variants, laterality defects can occur. However, it is difficult to establish a diagnosis in individuals with PCD and central pair (CP) defects, and alternative strategies are required because of very subtle ciliary beating abnormalities, a normal ciliary ultrastructure, and normal situs composition. Mutations in HYDIN are known to cause CP defects, but the genetic analysis of HYDIN variants is confounded by the pseudogene HYDIN2, which is almost identical in terms of intron/exon structure. We have previously shown that several types of PCD can be diagnosed via immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy analyses. Here, using IF microscopy, we demonstrated that in individuals with PCD and CP defects, the CP-associated protein SPEF2 is absent in HYDIN-mutant cells, revealing its dependence on functional HYDIN. Next, we performed IF analyses of SPEF2 in respiratory cells from 189 individuals with suspected PCD and situs solitus. Forty-one of the 189 individuals had undetectable SPEF2 and were subjected to a genetic analysis, which revealed one novel loss-of-function mutation in SPEF2 and three reported and 13 novel HYDIN mutations in 15 individuals. The remaining 25 individuals are good candidates for new, as-yet uncharacterized PCD variants that affect the CP apparatus. SPEF2 mutations have been associated with male infertility but have not previously been identified to cause PCD. We identified a mutation of SPEF2 that is causative for PCD with a CP defect. We conclude that SPEF2 IF analyses can facilitate the detection of CP defects and evaluation of the pathogenicity of HYDIN variants, thus aiding the molecular diagnosis of CP defects.

51	31298338	195894473	Combined mTOR/MEK inhibition prevents proliferation and induces apoptosis in NF2-mutant tumors	Merlin is encoded by Neurofibromatosis type 2 gene (NF-2), a tumor suppressor gene, which causes some multiple tumors forming disease of the nervous system in case of function loss. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that patients with NF-2 mutation had a worse prognosis, while it was associated with PI3K/mTOR activation, implying abnormal apoptosis in NF-2 mutation related tumors. Hence, we supposed that the inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR pathway might play a role in suppressing the tumor proliferation. Two representative NF-2 mutation tumor model of NCI-H2452 and HEI193 cell lines were adopted, while two PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors Trametinib and Vistusertib were chosen to study the proliferation and apoptosis of the tumor cells. CCK8 cell counting experiment showed that both Trametinib and Vistusertib could inhibit the proliferation of NCI-H2452 cell in vitro, while the combination of Trametinib and Vistusertib was more significant. Flow cytometry results showed that both Trametinib and Vistusertib could enhance apoptosis of NCI-H2452 cell in vitro, while the combination of Trametinib and Vistusertib was more significant. Similar results were also achieved for HEI193 cell lines. In vivo tumorigenicity experiments demonstrated that the tumor volume and weight were significantly decreased by both Trametinib and Vistusertib, while their combination had the most significant effect. Western blot results demonstrated that both Trametinib and Vistusertib could inhibit PI3K/mTOR /MEK pathway and enhance the expression of merlin. We found that PI3K/mTOR inhibitor could decrease the proliferation of NF-2 mutation tumor cell lines by enhancing apoptosis, while the combination of two drugs might have a better effect.

Four patients with extensive erosion, excavations, and pseudosatellite defects in the petrous apex are presented. These bony changes extended anteriorly up to the level of the carotid canal. The patients did not have stigmata of neurofibromatosis type 2 and they did not have systemic bony disorders. The tumors did not show any unusual histopathologic changes. Such invasive tumors present an unusual surgical challenge compared to vestibular schwannomas with a more typical pattern of bony erosion. Radiological features and surgical considerations relevant to vestibular schwannomas with this rare presentation are discussed.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
53	25082229	25583886	Common and distinctive pathogenetic features of arteriovenous malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 animal models--brief report	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder characterized by visceral and mucocutaneous arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Clinically indistinguishable hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 1 and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 are caused by mutations in ENG and ALK1, respectively. In this study, we have compared the development of visceral and mucocutaneous AVMs in adult stages between Eng- and Alk1-inducible knockout (iKO) models. Eng or Alk1 were deleted from either vascular endothelial cells (ECs) or smooth muscle cells in adult stages using Scl-CreER and Myh11-CreER lines, respectively. Latex perfusion and intravital spectral imaging in a dorsal skinfold window chamber system were used to visualize remodeling vasculature during AVM formation. Global Eng deletion resulted in lethality with visceral AVMs and wound-induced skin AVMs. Deletion of Alk1 or Eng in ECs, but not in smooth muscle cells, resulted in wound-induced skin AVMs. Visceral AVMs were observed in EC-specific Alk1-iKO but not in Eng-iKO. Intravital spectral imaging revealed that Eng-iKO model exhibited more dynamic processes for AVM development when compared with Alk1-iKO model. Both Alk1- and Eng-deficient models require a secondary insult, such as wounding, and ECs are the primary cell type responsible for the pathogenesis. However, Alk1 but not Eng deletion in ECs results in visceral AVMs.	Gold Standard	disease mechanism	2

We present the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome who underwent total thyroidectomy because of a large richly vascularized nodule (10 cm) compressing the trachea. The patient had a prolonged bleeding time (> 20 min) that remained unchanged after platelet transfusions. However, after infusion of platelets plus rFVIIa, it diminished to 5 min. The platelet aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate and collagen was diminished. Since an early age, the patient had repeated nose bleeding and an episode of melena requiring several tampons, cauterization and transfusions of packed red cells. In this case, we used rFVIIa in bolus for 1 day (four doses of 120 microg/kg every 2 h and six doses of 100 microg/kg every 3 h) and transfusion of platelet concentrates beginning just prior to surgery. No evidence of local bleeding complication could be detected during the entire post-operative period. The hemoglobin level remained normal and no transfusions of packed red cells were necessary. No adverse events occurred.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3

Good response to hormone treatment has been documented, although its use remains controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an antiestrogenic agent, Tamoxifen, in the treatment of HHT-associated epistaxis. Twenty-five patients (11 men, 14 women; mean age 51 years) with a diagnosis of epistaxis due to HHT were randomly assigned to receive treatment with oral tamoxifen 20 mg/d or placebo for 6 months. Follow-up consisted of physical examination and once-monthly blood tests. The groups were similar in age and sex distribution. Of the 21 participants who completed the trial, alleviation of the epistaxis was noted in 9 of 10 tamoxifen-treated patients and 3 of 11 placebo-treated patients (including 2 with only temporary improvement). The difference between the groups at the trial end point was significant for both frequency (P = .01) and severity (P = .049) of the disease. Hemoglobin concentration rose in 4 tamoxifen-treated patients and decreased in 5 controls. Tamoxifen appears to be an effective agent for the treatment of epistaxis due to HHT.

Although increasing data have been published on this entity in recent years, a great number of patients and health professionals remain unaware of this diagnosis. We herein report the case of a 56-year-old female with Li-FRAUMENI syndrome who presented with late right-sided recurrent breast swelling after prophylactic adenomastectomy with implant reconstruction. Imaging scans revealed an heterogeneous mass adjacent to the implant fibrous capsule. A biopsy of the lesion rendered the diagnosis of a BIA-ALCL. This case presents similarities with previous reports, but also some particularities, which should be stressed in order to make the diagnosis the earliest possible. The most distinct feature is that this is the second report of BIA-ALCL arising in the setting of Li-FRAUMENI syndrome.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
57	33361639	226984569	Reevaluating the pathogenicity of the variations c	439 G>A and c.2132 C>T in the PLA2G6 gene.. The phospholipase A2 group VI (PLA2G6) gene encodes for a Ca2+-independent PLA2, which is localized in the cytosol, in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the mitochondrial membrane, plays a major role in phospholipid remodelling. Mutations within this gene have been reported to cause different phenotypes: infantile-onset neuroaxonal dystrophy associated with brain iron accumulation and adult-onset parkinsonian syndrome. In the present study, we analysed the PLA2G6 gene sequence in an asymptomatic young woman that was referred to our laboratory by a geneticist for an history of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy in her little maternal cousin in whom the results of the genetical analysis were not available. We found two variants in the PLA2G6 gene (NM_003560.4, c.439 G>A and c.2132 C>T, p.Ala147Thr and p.Pro711Leu) previously reported as pathogenic. These results prompted us to perform a segregation analysis in the parents of this woman and we only found the presence of both variants in the asymptomatic 56-year-old patient's mother. Our molecular genetic testing clearly indicates that the c.439 G>A and c.2132 C>T variations identified in the PLA2G6 gene are positioned in cis and are not responsible for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy which is an autosomal recessive disease.

58	14583457	6042252	Li-Fraumeni and related syndromes: correlation between tumor type, family structure, and TP53 genotype	A database has been created to collect information on families carrying a germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene and on families affected with Li-Fraumeni syndromes [Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL)]. Data from the published literature have been included. The database is available online at http://www.iarc.fr/p53, as part of the IARC TP53 Database. The analysis of the 265 families/individuals that have been included thus far has revealed several new findings. In classical LFS families with a germ-line TP53 mutation (83 families), the mean age of onset of breast cancer was significantly lower than in LFS families (16 families) without a TP53 mutation (34.6 versus 42.5 years; P = 0.0035). In individuals with a TP53 mutation, a correlation between the genotype and phenotype was found. Brain tumors were associated with missense TP53 mutations located in the DNA-binding loop that contact the minor groove of DNA (P = 0.01), whereas adrenal gland carcinomas were associated with missense mutations located in the loops opposing the protein-DNA contact surface (P = 0.003). Finally, mutations likely to result in a null phenotype (absence of the protein or loss of function) were associated with earlier onset brain tumors (P = 0.004). These observations have clinical implications for genetic testing and tumor surveillance in LFS/LFL families.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
59	1569604	25480537	Detection of novel germ-line p53 mutations in diverse-cancer-prone families identified by selecting patients with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma	Germ-line p53 mutations appear to be inherited among the members of families diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). The mutations detected in those families to date have been clustered in exon 7 of the p53 gene and, typically, have been single-base substitutions resulting in amino acid changes. Our aim was to define the spectrum of p53 mutations associated with LFS. From seven cancer-prone families identified by selecting members with childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as probands, we chose two families, each of which had two members from whom specimens could be obtained for genetic analysis. To detect germ-line p53 gene mutations in these individuals, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis with Taq polymerase and oligonucleotide primers specific for p53 gene sequences. Genomic DNA extracted from fresh tissue samples and paraffin-embedded tumor samples was amplified, denatured, and electrophoresed on neutral polyacrylamide gels. PCR amplification was also carried out using total RNA from adrenocortical carcinoma samples of the proband in family 1. PCR products were purified, subcloned, and sequenced. We detected novel germ-line p53 mutations in affected members of both cancer-prone families. In the proband of family 1, a single-base deletion was detected at the first nucleotide of codon 307 in exon 8 of the p53 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 10. In family 2, we detected an A to C transversion at the second nucleotide of codon 286 in exon 8, both in DNA isolated from the adrenocortical tumor of the proband and in DNA isolated from the astrocytoma of the proband's father. This single-base substitution resulted in an amino acid substitution of alanine for glutamic acid. Both of these mutations are located outside the highly conserved region of the p53 gene where mutations in patients with LFS have been reported previously. Our results indicate that a wide range of germ-line p53 mutations is inherited in members of diverse-cancer-prone families.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

After biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare entity with an unpredictable, potentially fatal, clinical course and outcome. Due to its rarity, this entity should be considered when a solitary hepatic lesion is detected and should be included in the differential diagnosis with liver metastases. We highlight the infrequency of this tumor, its presentation as a solitary hepatic lesion and the indication of surgical treatment. We describe the clinical and pathological characteristics of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver and report a new case of this entity. The distinct therapeutic options are discussed.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8), which encodes a functional cytokine (vIL-6), has been found in some patients with Castleman's disease. Lymph nodes from 14 HIV-seronegative Castleman's disease patients were compared to hyperplastic lymph nodes from 25 HIV-seronegative patients as well as Kaposi's sarcoma lesions from 48 patients for KSHV infection and vIL-6, human IL-6, and Epstein-Barr virus EBER expression. While all Kaposi's sarcoma tissues examined were polymerase chain reaction-positive and all control lymph nodes were polymerase chain reaction-negative for KSHV, none had detectable vIL-6 expression. Six of 14 (43%) Castleman's tissues were positive for KSHV by polymerase chain reaction and all 6 had evidence of vIL-6 expression by immunohistochemistry. vIL-6-positive Castleman's disease patients generally had the multicentric plasma cell variant form of the disease and had a rapidly fatal clinical course frequently associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and gammopathy. In contrast, 7 (88%) of the 8 vIL-6-negative Castleman's disease patients had localized disease and have remained disease-free after therapy. KSHV vIL-6 expression appears to be limited to hematopoietic cells and is not present in Kaposi's sarcoma spindle cells. These data suggest that Castleman's disease is a syndrome of multiple etiologies involving aberrant IL-6 activity from either endogenous or viral sources.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

There are no established treatments for the regressive symptoms. However, there are some known causes of this type of regression, such as Rett syndrome and Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). In LKS, steroids have been used as a treatment. Some evidence suggests an autoimmune contribution to the pathophysiology of autism (Chez MG, Guido-Estrada N: Immune therapy in autism: historical experience and future directions with immunomodulatory therapy.

We used the homozygosity gene-mapping strategy to localize this disorder to the region of chromosome 11p between markers D11S1334 and D11S899 (maximum LOD score 5.02 [theta = 0] at marker D11S926) in five consanguineous families of Saudi Arabian origin. These results extend those of a recent report that also placed PHHI on chromosome 11p, between markers D11S926 and D11S928. Comparison of the boundaries of these two overlapping regions allows the PHHI locus to be assigned to the 4-cM region between the markers D11S926 and D11S899. Identification of this gene may allow a better understanding of other disorders of glucose homeostasis, by providing insight into the regulation of insulin release.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

A useful indicator for the difficult diagnosis is the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) that is significantly lower in pathological cases than in physiological ones. The CBF computation is not rapid, therefore, the aim of this study is to propose an automated method to evaluate it directly from videos of ciliated cells. The cells are taken from inferior nasal turbinates and videos of ciliary movements are registered and eventually processed by the developed software. The software consists in the extraction of features from videos (written with C++ language) and the computation of the frequency (written with Matlab language). This system was tested both on the samples of nasal cavity and software models, and the results were really promising because in a few seconds, it can compute a reliable frequency if compared with that measured with visual methods. It is to be noticed that the reliability of the computation increases with the quality of acquisition system and especially with the sampling frequency. It is concluded that the developed software could be a useful mean for PCD diagnosis.	Gold Standard	other	1

Serious consequences may result if visceral arteriovenous malformations, particularly in the pulmonary circulation, are unrecognized and left untreated. In spite of the identification of two of the disease-causing genes (endoglin and ALK-1), only a clinical diagnosis of HHT can be provided for the majority of individuals. On behalf of the Scientific Advisory Board of the HHT Foundation International, Inc., we present consensus clinical diagnostic criteria. The four criteria (epistaxes, telangiectasia, visceral lesions and an appropriate family history) are carefully delineated. The HHT diagnosis is definite if three criteria are present. A diagnosis of HHT cannot be established in patients with only two criteria, but should be recorded as possible or suspected to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion. If fewer than two criteria are present, HHT is unlikely, although children of affected individuals should be considered at risk in view of age-related penetration in this disorder. These criteria may be refined as molecular diagnostic tests become available in the next few years.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
68	29743243	13669204	CFTR/ENaC-dependent regulation of membrane potential during human sperm capacitation is initiated by bicarbonate uptake through NBC	To fertilize an egg, sperm must reside in the female reproductive tract to undergo several maturational changes that are collectively referred to as capacitation. From a molecular point of view, the HCO3--dependent activation of the atypical soluble adenylyl cyclase (ADCY10) is one of the first events that occurs during capacitation and leads to the subsequent cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Capacitation is also accompanied by hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. We previously reported that PKA activation is necessary for CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel) activity and for the modulation of membrane potential (Em). However, the main HCO3- transporters involved in the initial transport and the PKA-dependent Em changes are not well known nor characterized. Here, we analyzed how the activity of CFTR regulates Em during capacitation and examined its relationship with an electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC) and epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs). We observed that inhibition of both CFTR and NBC decreased HCO3- influx, resulting in lower PKA activity, and that events downstream of the cAMP activation of PKA are essential for the regulation of Em. Addition of a permeable cAMP analog partially rescued the inhibitory effects caused by these inhibitors. HCO3- also produced a rapid membrane hyperpolarization mediated by ENaC channels, which contribute to the regulation of Em during capacitation. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first time, that NBC cotransporters and ENaC channels are essential in the CFTR-dependent activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and Em regulation during human sperm capacitation.

69	14648717	42282644	CHEK2 1100delC is not a risk factor for male breast cancer population	Genetic risk factors for male breast cancer (MBC) are poorly understood. High penetrance genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 account for only a small proportion of the disease. A 1100delC mutation in CHEK2 (previously known as CHK2), a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase, has been implicated in predisposition of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and breast cancer in families suggestive of LFS. This 1100delC mutation has also been shown to confer a 2-fold increase of breast cancer risk in women and a 10-fold increase of risk in men. It was estimated to account for 1% of breast cancers in women and as much as 9% of breast cancers in men at the population level based on analysis of breast cancer families without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. We wanted to evaluate the significance of CHEK2 1100delC in predisposition to MBC by assessing its frequency in a population-based material of 114 Finnish MBC patients. Two patients (1.8%) carried the 1100delC mutation. The mutation frequency among MBC cases was similar to that seen in population controls (26/1885, 1.4%). Our results indicate that CHEK2 1100delC variant does not substantially increase the risk of male breast cancer at the population level. We cannot exclude the fact that a small fraction of hereditary, family-positive male breast cancers could be attributable to CHEK2 mutations.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
70	19205515	6660090	Analysis of molecular background of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia--Rendu-Osler-Weber disease--preliminary results	Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) known also as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by localized angiodysplasia due to mutations in ENG (endoglin, 9q34.1) or ALK-1 gene (the activin receptor-like kinase 1, 12q13). ENG and ALK-1 are found associated with two disease subtypes designated as HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. Subtype HHT1 remains in the frame of interest of laryngology because of frequent bleeding in head and neck region. The study was designed to identify a genetic background in a large family (29 individuals) with diagnosed HHT. Pedigree analysis showed autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Study design comprised segregation analysis to determine locus with subsequent direct sequencing of the gene. Four microsatelite markers (d9s61, d9s65, d12s368, d12s347) with high frequency of heterozygosity in population study were used. The results concerning heterozygosity ranged from 15% to 53%. The established differences were not sufficient enough to indicate co-segregation of the studied loci. DNA sequence analysis in exon 11 of ENG gene did not reveal mutations. The latter result could be explained by an occurrence of mutations in other exons of ENG. The study requires continuation for gene identification and precise genotype-phenotype correlation aiming for an improvement of HHT1 therapy.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

72	8203193	9225460	Effects of electrical brainstem stimulation on tinnitus	The primary aim of the auditory brainstem implant (ABI), an investigational device, is to restore auditory sensations in neurofibromatosis-2 patients deafened by bilateral acoustic neuroma surgery. An electrode is placed on the dorsal cochlear nucleus after the tumor is removed through the translabyrinthine approach. This procedure was performed on 18 patients: 13 were completely deafferentated after bilateral tumor removal and had received the ABI during surgery on the second-sided tumor; 5 were implanted at first-sided tumor removal. Three of these 5 patients had usable hearing remaining on the side of the second acoustic neuroma and were stimulated only during laboratory sessions. All patients had tinnitus. We used a questionnaire to assess the effects of brainstem stimulation on this symptom. Of the 18 patients, one early patient deceased, and one patient with no follow-up was not included in this study. Six patients who were unable to use the ABI because of temporary hardware problems or side effects from electrical stimulation were also excluded. Thus, we studied 10 patients. Of 7 patients who used their implant daily, 6 reported noticeable tinnitus reduction; the ABI had no effect in the remaining case. Of 3 recently implanted patients who used this implant only during laboratory testing, one patient reported complete suppression of tinnitus, one described worse tinnitus, and one reported no effect.

74	23596466	2237325	Bone loss in Gorham's disease: A case study	In this study, a rare disease with characteristics of spontaneous osteolysis of the bone is reported. The patient was an eight-year-old male, who was admitted with shortness of breath. The absence of the right clavicle was identified by radiography. However, the change to the right clavicle was not malignant, as indicated by bone scanography. The biopsy of the right cervical rib revealed a number of vascular fibrous tissues and vessels distending and shunting together; however, no cell proliferation was observed. In addition, no acid-fast bacillia or malignant cells were detected in the sample of pleural effusion from the patient. Low hemoglobin (93 g/l) and a slight elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels (133 U/l) were observed; however, the other laboratory examination results were normal. The follow-up investigation and radiotherapy results indicated that the osteolysis of the skull and the other portion of bone had not worsened. Although it has been reported that >15% of patients succumb to this disease, the patient reported in the current study was in a relatively stable condition.

75	23371338	22640055	Gorham-Stout disease and generalized lymphatic anomaly--clinical, radiologic, and histologic differentiation	Gorham-Stout disease (GSD) is a rare vascular disorder of lymphatic origin characterized by progressive osteolysis. Generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA) is a multisystem disorder that also commonly affects bone. We hypothesized that Gorham-Stout disease is different from other osseous lymphatic anomalies. We proposed to discriminate these entities by analyzing findings on skeletal imaging. Clinical data, imaging studies, and histopathologic findings were retrospectively reviewed in patients presenting to our Vascular Anomalies Center with lymphatic anomalies of bone. Within a cohort of 51 patients with lymphatic disorder and radiological evidence of bony involvement, two distinct categories emerged. Nineteen patients met the imaging criteria for GSD: progressive osteolysis with resorption and cortical loss. Thirty-two were categorized as GLA: Discrete radiolucencies and increasing numbers of bone affected over time, but without evidence of progressive osteolysis. The ribs were the most common site in both groups, followed by the cranium, clavicle, and cervical spine in GSD, and thoracic spine, humerus, and femur in GLA. Fewer bones were involved in GSD, with relative sparing of the appendicular skeleton. Associated infiltrative soft tissue abnormality was seen in 18 in GSD, but only six with GLA. Macrocystic lymphatic malformations were identified in 14 with GLA, but none with GSD. There are significant radiological differences between GSD and GLA, although there are some overlapping features. The major distinguishing characteristic is the progressive osteolysis seen in GSD. Findings suggestive of GLA are more extensive involvement, particularly of the appendicular skeleton, presence of discretemacrocystic lymphatic malformations and visceral organ lesions.

77	7597693	3010022	A clinical trial of therapeutic electrical stimulation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	This paper describes the effects of therapeutic electrical stimulation (TES) on the wasting muscles in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The patient is a 47-year-old male, and he has a history of progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, affected more in the right side. Percutaneously indwelling intramuscular electrodes were implanted to the affected muscles in the right upper and lower extremities but no electrode in the corresponding left region. Within a month of TES therapy, a rapid improvement of extremity motion appeared in the TES treated side. Long-term application of TES more than 3 months increased the strength of the muscle which had been evidently weaker than the non-treated side. CT findings of both the upper and lower extremities with TES therapy showed an increase in the density and a reduction in the moth-eaten image. An increase in the thickness of the muscles was also observed in the TES treated side while deterioration was observed in the muscles on the non-treated side.	Labeled	patient-based therapeutics	4

High dose prednisolone, which was initially used to treat these patients, failed to remit the disease in all cases. Although they were resistant to prednisolone, all these patients had remarkable improvements in clinical and laboratory findings after switching to an equivalent dose of dexamethasone. We propose using dexamethasone as an alternative for treating ASD before adding immunosuppressants or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), when prednisolone therapy does not suppress disease activity sufficiently.

The goals of radiosurgery include preservation of neurological function and prevention of tumor growth. Longer-term outcomes are not well documented for patients with solitary tumors or those with neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). To define outcomes, the authors evaluated 462 consecutive patients with solitary acoustic tumors and 40 patients with NF2 (total of 45 tumors treated) who underwent radiosurgery between 1987 and 1998. Serial imaging studies, clinical evaluations, and a patient survey were performed. The average tumor margin dose was 15 Gy, and the mean transverse tumor diameter was 22 mm. In patients with solitary tumors, prior resection had been performed in 111 patients (24%); 27 patients experienced tumor recurrence after a ""total resection."" The clinical tumor control rate (no resection required) was 98%. In non-NF2 patients followed for at least 5 years, 100 tumors (61.7%) were smaller, 53 (32.7%) remained unchanged in size, and nine (5.6%) were slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2.4%). Neurological deficits after radiosurgery all occurred within the first 28 months. The rates of facial and trigeminal neuropathy varied with radiosurgery technique. In patients with NF2, 16 tumors were smaller, 28 remained unchanged, and one enlarged (overall 98% control rate at median 3-year follow up). Resection was performed in three patients (7%). Useful hearing was preserved in six (43%) of 14 NF2 patients who had useful hearing before radiosurgery. Radiosurgery provided long-term tumor control associated with high rates of neurological function preservation. No further tumor surgery was necessary in 98% of patients with solitary tumors followed for a minimum of 5 years."	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3
81	15168449	24620062	Adult-onset Still disease presenting with disseminated intravascular coagulation	A 17-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of pyrexia and thrombocytopenia in May 2002. Laboratory examination showed a platelet count of 50,000/microliter with an increased level of fibrinogen degradation product, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Gabexate mesilate was intravenously administrated without any effects. Several days later, erythema, joint pain and neck lymphadenopathy developed sequentially. The patient was diagnosed as having adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) complicated with DIC. Moreover, serum inflammatory cytokine levels had increased and activated macrophages were observed in the bone marrow, suggesting the presence of macrophage activation syndrome. After additional treatments with dalteparin and aspirin, the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings associated with AOSD and DIC disappeared. Although this was a severe case of AOSD associated with preceding DIC, the AOSD symptoms resolved in this patient with the treatment of the DIC and with aspirin only without any relapse.

82	24498942	11272744	The role of molecular genetic analysis in the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder of motile cilia. The diagnosis of PCD has previously relied on ciliary analysis with transmission electron microscopy or video microscopy. However, patients with PCD may have normal ultrastructural appearance, and ciliary analysis has limited accessibility. Alternatively, PCD can be diagnosed by demonstrating biallelic mutations in known PCD genes. Genetic testing is emerging as a diagnostic tool to complement ciliary analysis where interpretation and access may delay diagnosis. To determine the diagnostic yield of genetic testing of patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of PCD in a multiethnic urban center. Twenty-eight individuals with confirmed PCD on transmission electron microscopy of ciliary ultrastructure and 24 individuals with a probable diagnosis of PCD based on a classical PCD phenotype and low nasal nitric oxide had molecular analysis of 12 genes associated with PCD. Of 49 subjects who underwent ciliary biopsy, 28 (57%) were diagnosed with PCD through an ultrastructural defect. Of the 52 individuals who underwent molecular genetic analysis, 22 (42%) individuals had two mutations in known PCD genes. Twenty-four previously unreported mutations in known PCD genes were observed. Combining both diagnostic modalities of biopsy and molecular genetics, the diagnostic yield increased to 69% compared with 57% based on biopsy alone. The diagnosis of PCD is challenging and has traditionally relied on ciliary biopsy, which is unreliable as the sole criterion for a definitive diagnosis. Molecular genetic analysis can be used as a complementary test to increase the diagnostic yield.	Gold Standard	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

Three nNO sampling methods were examined and compared as first-line tests for PCD. Healthy subjects, confirmed PCDs, consecutive referrals with PCD-like symptoms and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) had nNO sampled during breath hold (BH-nNO), oral exhalation against resistance (OE-R-nNO) and tidal breathing (TB-nNO) aiming to expand age range into infancy. 282 subjects, 117 consecutive referrals, 59 PCDs, 49 CF patients and 57 healthy subjects, were included. All methods separated significantly between PCD and non-PCD, including CF with reliability, in ranking order BH-nNO>OE-R-nNO>TB-nNO. Acceptability in children ranked in reverse order. A problematic high fraction (39%) of false positive TB-nNO was found in young children. An unexpected large fraction (6.8%) of PCDs had nNO values above cut-off. nNO is a helpful first-line tool in real-life PCD work-up in all age groups if the sampling method is chosen according to age. nNO can be misleading in a few patients with true PCD. Further studies are strongly needed in young children.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3

85	21472510	23173154	Endovascular treatment of epistaxis: indications, management, and outcome	Epistaxis is a common clinical problem, and the majority of bleedings can be managed conservatively. However, due to extensive and sometimes life-threatening bleeding, further treatment, such as superselective embolization, may be required. We report our experience with endovascular treatment of life-threatening epistaxis. All patients presenting with excessive epistaxis, which received endovascular treatment at a German tertiary care facility between January 2001 and December 2009, were retrospectively identified. Demographic data, etiology, origin and clinical relevance of bleeding, interventional approach, therapy-associated complications, and outcome were assessed. A total of 48 patients required 53 embolizations. Depending on the etiology of bleeding, patients were assigned to three groups: 1) idiopathic epistaxis (31/48), 2) traumatic or iatrogenic epistaxis (12/48), and 3) hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) (5/48). Eleven of 48 patients required blood transfusions, and 9 of these 11 patients (82%) were termed clinically unstable. The sphenopalatine artery was embolized unilaterally in 10 of 53 (18.9%) and bilaterally in 41 of 53 (77.4%) procedures. During the same procedure, additional vessels were embolized in three patients (3/53; 5.7%). In 2 of 53(3.8%) cases, the internal carotid artery (ICA) was occluded. Long-term success rates of embolization were 29 of 31 (93.5%) for group 1 and 11 of 12 (91.7%) for group 2 patients. Embolization of patients with HHT offered at least a temporary relief in three of five (60%) cases. Two major complications (necrosis of nasal tip and transient hemiparesis) occurred after embolization. Endovascular treatment proves to be effective for prolonged and life-threatening epistaxis. It is easily repeatable if the first procedure is not successful and offers a good risk-benefit profile.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3
86	11600572	41552588	An inherited mutation outside the highly conserved DNA-binding domain of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in children and adults with sporadic adrenocortical tumors	Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the single most common genetic alterations in human cancers. Recently, a distinct nucleotide substitution was identified in exon 10 of the p53 gene, leading to an Arg337His mutation in 97% of children with adrenocortical tumors from Southern Brazil. In the present study, we investigated the presence of this mutation in a larger series of 55 patients (37 adults and 18 children) with benign and malignant sporadic adrenocortical tumors. None of the patients had family cancer histories that conformed to the criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Twenty-one asymptomatic close relatives of patients with p53 mutations and 60 normal unrelated individuals were also studied. The missense Arg337His mutation was identified in 19 patients (14 children and 5 adults), and 8 of 11 cases studied had LOH. Among the 19 patients with the Arg337His mutation, only one boy and three adults showed fatal evolution or recurrent metastases. This mutation was also identified in heterozygous state in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of the patients, indicating that Arg337His mutation was inherited in most cases. In contrast, this mutation was not found in 120 alleles of normal unrelated controls. In conclusion, the germ line Arg337His mutation of p53 protein is present at a high frequency (77.7%) in children with benign or malignant sporadic adrenocortical tumors, but it is not restricted to the pediatric group, since 13.5% of adults with adrenocortical tumors also had this mutation. The presence of this mutation was related to unfavorable prognosis in most of the adults, but not in the children with adrenocortical tumors.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

Epilepsy is a common finding but there is wide phenotypic variation that has not been thoroughly explored. We report the epilepsy phenotypes of 7 patients with the A3243G mutation. Most presented with typical MELAS and epilepsy characterized by infrequent prolonged focal seizures, including epilepsia partialis continua, hemiclonic status epilepticus, nonconvulsive status, and occipital status epilepticus. Seizures usually occurred during the acute phase of a strokelike episode. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges may be seen electrographically. Some patients with this mutation are completely asymptomatic or have mild symptoms typical for mitochondrial diseases. Slow spike-wave activity consistent with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and electrographic status epilepticus was seen in 1 patient who responded to ethosuximide.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
88	11900566	44495974	Epithelial-type and neural-type cadherin expression in malignant noncarcinomatous neoplasms with epithelioid features that involve the soft tissues.	"CONTEXT
Transmembrane adhesion molecules, epithelial-type cadherin (ECAD) and neural-type cadherin (NCAD), help in regulating transformations between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the developing embryo and in maintaining the epithelioid phenotype. Consequently, the presence of epithelioid cells in certain malignant noncarcinomatous neoplasms raises speculation that the expression of ECAD and NCAD in these neoplasms may have diagnostic significance.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the utility of ECAD and NCAD immunoexpression in distinguishing malignant (noncarcinomatous) neoplasms with epithelioid features that involve the soft tissues.


DESIGN
Membranous immunoreactivity of anti-ECAD and anti-NCAD was evaluated on archived cases selected from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.


RESULTS
Epithelial-type cadherin was found in biphasic synovial sarcoma (35 of 35 cases), malignant melanoma (13/21), monophasic fibrous synovial sarcoma (13/26), clear cell sarcoma (4/9), poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma (3/13), diffuse mesothelioma (4/20), malignant epithelioid peripheral nerve sheath tumor (1/6), and epithelioid sarcoma (5/62). Neural-type cadherin was observed in chordoma (11/11), biphasic synovial sarcoma (30/35), diffuse mesothelioma (14/20), malignant melanoma (14/25), epithelioid sarcoma (24/63), epithelioid angiosarcoma (1/4), poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma (2/13), clear cell sarcoma (1/10), and monophasic fibrous synovial sarcoma (1/26). Eighteen cases of primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas all tested positive for ECAD, whereas NCAD was focally observed in 5 cases. No expression of either molecule was observed in cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (n = 9), alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 8), and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (n = 7).


CONCLUSIONS
Epithelial-type and neural-type cadherins are found in a variety of noncarcinomatous neoplasms with epithelioid features that involve the soft tissues and can be utilized, in association with other immunomarkers, in distinguishing chordoma (100% NCAD) from extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and conventional chondrosarcoma of bone (0% NCAD), squamous cell carcinoma (100% ECAD) from epithelioid sarcoma (8% ECAD), and biphasic synovial sarcoma (100% ECAD) from diffuse mesothelioma (20% ECAD)."

90	25313051	5168445	Whole-genome sequencing analysis of phenotypic heterogeneity and anticipation in Li-Fraumeni cancer predisposition syndrome	The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and its variant form (LFL) is a familial predisposition to multiple forms of childhood, adolescent, and adult cancers associated with germ-line mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Individual disparities in tumor patterns are compounded by acceleration of cancer onset with successive generations. It has been suggested that this apparent anticipation pattern may result from germ-line genomic instability in TP53 mutation carriers, causing increased DNA copy-number variations (CNVs) with successive generations. To address the genetic basis of phenotypic disparities of LFS/LFL, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 13 subjects from two generations of an LFS kindred. Neither de novo CNV nor significant difference in total CNV was detected in relation with successive generations or with age at cancer onset. These observations were consistent with an experimental mouse model system showing that trp53 deficiency in the germ line of father or mother did not increase CNV occurrence in the offspring. On the other hand, individual records on 1,771 TP53 mutation carriers from 294 pedigrees were compiled to assess genetic anticipation patterns (International Agency for Research on Cancer TP53 database). No strictly defined anticipation pattern was observed. Rather, in multigeneration families, cancer onset was delayed in older compared with recent generations. These observations support an alternative model for apparent anticipation in which rare variants from noncarrier parents may attenuate constitutive resistance to tumorigenesis in the offspring of TP53 mutation carriers with late cancer onset.

91	25557953	206235908	Unique genomic profile of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.	"BACKGROUND & AIMS
Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic cancer that develops in children and young adults without cirrhosis. Little is known about its pathogenesis, and it can be treated only with surgery. We performed an integrative genomic analysis of a large series of patients with FLC to identify associated genetic factors.


METHODS
By using 78 clinically annotated FLC samples, we performed whole-transcriptome (n = 58), single-nucleotide polymorphism array (n = 41), and next-generation sequencing (n = 48) analyses; we also assessed the prevalence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript associated with this cancer (n = 73). We performed class discovery using non-negative matrix factorization, and functional annotation using gene-set enrichment analyses, nearest template prediction, ingenuity pathway analyses, and immunohistochemistry. The genomic identification of significant targets in a cancer algorithm was used to identify chromosomal aberrations, MuTect and VarScan2 were used to identify somatic mutations, and the random survival forest was used to determine patient prognoses. Findings were validated in an independent cohort.


RESULTS
Unsupervised gene expression clustering showed 3 robust molecular classes of tumors: the proliferation class (51% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate proliferation and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling activation; the inflammation class (26% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate inflammation and cytokine enriched production; and the unannotated class (23% of samples) had a gene expression signature that was not associated previously with liver tumors. Expression of genes that regulate neuroendocrine function, as well as histologic markers of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, were detected in all 3 classes. FLCs had few copy number variations; the most frequent were focal amplification at 8q24.3 (in 12.5% of samples), and deletions at 19p13 (in 28% of samples) and 22q13.32 (in 25% of samples). The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was detected in 79% of samples. FLC samples also contained mutations in cancer-related genes such as BRCA2 (in 4.2% of samples), which are uncommon in liver neoplasms. However, FLCs did not contain mutations most commonly detected in liver cancers. We identified an 8-gene signature that predicted survival of patients with FLC.


CONCLUSIONS
In a genomic analysis of 78 FLC samples, we identified 3 classes based on gene expression profiles. FLCs contain mutations and chromosomal aberrations not previously associated with liver cancer, and almost 80% contain the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript. By using this information, we identified a gene signature that is associated with patient survival time."	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
92	10930589	39095271	Increased reactive oxygen species in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with mutations in SOD1	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a paralytic disorder characterized by degeneration of large motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. A subset of ALS is inherited (familial ALS, FALS) and is associated with more than 70 different mutations in the SOD1 gene. Here we report that lymphoblast cell lines derived from FALS patients with 16 different mutations in SOD1 gene exhibit significant increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with sporadic ALS (SALS) and normal controls (spouses of ALS patients). The ROS generation did not correlate with SOD1 activity. Further, cells incubated with vitamin C, catalase or the flavinoid quercetin significantly reduced ROS in all groups. The catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole resulted in a ten-fold increase of ROS in all groups. Neither L-nitroarginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor or vitamin E altered the ROS levels. Thus, these studies suggest that hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a major ROS elevated in FALS lymphoblasts and it may contribute to the degeneration of susceptible cells. Further, we postulate a mechanism by which increased H(2)O(2) could be generated by mutant SOD1.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
93	12453878	350536	Activin receptor-like kinase 1 is implicated in the maturation phase of angiogenesis.	Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) is an orphan type I receptor of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor family. In vivo studies have demonstrated that this endothelial-specific receptor is implicated in angiogenesis. In this study, we addressed the cellular function of ALK-1 in cultured human microvascular endothelial cells from the dermis (HMVEC-d's) using adenoviral expression of a constitutively active form of ALK-1 (ALK-1QD). We observed that ALK-1QD expression inhibits cell proliferation through an arrest in the G1 phase in the cell cycle. ALK-1QD expression also inhibited migration. This inhibition was also observed in other endothelial cells (human microvascular endothelial cells [HMEC-1's], HMVECs from the lung, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs]). Finally, ALK-1QD expression decreased re-adhesion and spreading to different matrices. This led us to examine the dynamic formation of adhesion complexes. We demonstrated that while beta-gal-infected cells reorganized actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes at the edge of a wound, ALK-1QD-infected cells did not. To identify downstream genes implicated in ALK-1 cellular responses, we next performed a cDNA array analysis of the expressed genes. There were 13 genes found to be significantly induced or suppressed by ALK-1QD. Among them, 2 genes encoded cell cycle-related proteins (c-myc and p21/waf1), 3 encoded components of the cytoskeleton-focal adhesion complex (beta-actin, paxillin, and zyxin), and 2 encoded members of the TGF-beta family (BMPRII and GDF-15). Taken together, our results suggest that ALK-1 is implicated in the maturation phase of angiogenesis. Disruption of this latter phase of angiogenesis may be an important step in the development of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
94	11676999	25654143	Patients' assessment of quality of life instruments: a randomised study of SIP, SF-36 and SEIQoL-DW in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	The evaluation of quality of life (QoL) plays an increasingly important role in clinical research and drug trials in ALS. However, most of the scales employed so far are based on a fixed external value system, and may therefore not reflect the patients' subjective perception of QoL accurately. In addition, many ALS patients complain about the psychological distress inflicted by QoL questionnaires which focus on functional status, as they constantly remind patients of their deterioration. We therefore asked 42 ALS patients to assess, using visual analogue scales, their subjective perception of the validity of three QoL instruments as well as the emotional distress caused by them. The scales were: the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual QoL-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW). Patients were examined at least three times at two-month intervals. The SIP was filled out by all patients, the SF-36 and the SEIQoL-DW were assigned at random. The validity of the SEIQoL-DW was rated higher than that of the SIP (p<0.001) and of the SF-36 (p<0.001). The SIP imparted a higher emotional distress to patients than the SEIQoL-DW (p<0.005), with a trend in the same direction for the SF-36 (p=0.082). The most frequently mentioned QoL-relevant domains in the SEIQoL-DW were family (100%), health (53%), and profession (50%). These results should prompt further discussion and investigation on the most appropriate way to assess QoL in patients with ALS.	Labeled	other	1

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to regulate the initiation and progression of tumors. However, the exact molecular mechanisms involving lncRNA in osteosarcomagenesis remain largely unknown. Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a familial cancer syndrome caused by germline p53 mutation. We investigated the tumor suppressor function of lncRNA H19 in LFS-associated osteosarcoma. Analyzing H19-induced transcriptome alterations in LFS induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived osteoblasts, we unexpectedly discovered a large group of snoRNAs whose expression was significantly affected by H19. We identified SNORA7A among the H19-suppressed snoRNAs. SNORA7A restoration impairs H19-mediated osteogenesis and tumor suppression, indicating an oncogenic role of SNORA7A. TCGA analysis indicated that SNORA7A expression is associated with activation of oncogenic signaling and poor survival in cancer patients. Using an optimized streptavidin-binding RNA aptamer designed from H19 lncRNA, we revealed that H19-tethered protein complexes include proteins critical for DNA damage response and repair, confirming H19's tumor suppressor role. In summary, our findings demonstrate a critical role of H19-modulated SNORA7A expression in LFS-associated osteosarcomas.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
96	26031996	28958844	Determination of the mutant allele frequency in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and somatic mosaicism by means of deep sequencing	Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal disorder caused by mutations of the NF2 gene. More than half of all NF2 patients have unaffected parents and carry de novo mutations, which may be of prezygotic or postzygotic origin. The latter can result in mosaicism, which is relatively common in NF2 patients. Previous studies indicated that, in 50% of patients with mosaic NF2 mutations, the mutant allele is only detectable by Sanger sequencing of PCR products amplified from tumor tissue but not from blood samples. In order to establish a highly sensitive method that has the power to detect low levels of NF2 mutant alleles from blood samples of mosaic NF2 patients, we performed ultra deep sequencing and calculated the percentage of mutant and wildtype NF2 alleles. The mutant allele frequencies detected ranged from 2.6% to 19.7%. In three patients, however, the NF2 mutation previously identified in tumor tissue was not identified in blood samples by means of deep sequencing, suggesting absence of mutant cells in the blood. Remarkably, we observed a correlation between the age at onset of the disease and the mutant allele frequency. Our study indicates that ultra deep sequencing is an effective and highly sensitive method to determine the mutant allele frequency in patients with mosaic NF2 gene mutations, which enables extended phenotype/correlations in these patients. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The prevalence of abnormal neurodevelopment in transient CHI (T-CHI) is not known. We have aimed to investigate abnormal neurodevelopment and associated factors in T-CHI and P-CHI. A cohort of children with CHI (n = 67, age 2.5-5 years) was assessed at follow-up review and noted to have normal or abnormal (mild or severe) neurodevelopmental outcomes for the domains of speech and language, motor, and vision. Children were classified as P-CHI (n = 33), if they had undergone surgery or remained on medical therapy, or T-CHI (n = 34), if medical treatment for hypoglycemia was stopped. Overall, abnormal neurodevelopment was present in 26 (39%) children with CHI, of whom 18 (69%) were severe. Importantly, the incidence of abnormal neurodevelopment in T-CHI was similar to that in P-CHI (30 vs. 47% respectively, p = 0.16). The prevalence of severe abnormal neurodevelopment in speech, motor, and vision domains was similar in both T-CHI and P-CHI children. For this cohort, we found that the severity of disease [based upon maximal diazoxide dose (odds ratio 95% confidence intervals) 1.3 (1.1; 1.5), p = 0.03], and early presentation of CHI <7 days following birth [5.9 (1.3; 27.8), p = 0.02] were significantly associated with abnormal neurodevelopment. There was no significant association with gender, genotype, or the histopathological basis of CHI. Abnormal neurodevelopment was evident in one third of children with both T-CHI and P-CHI, early presentation and severe CHI being risk factors. Early recognition and rapid correction of hypoglycemia are advocated to avoid abnormal neurodevelopment in children with CHI.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
98	21456924	207556486	Use of a side-cutting aspiration device for resection of tumors during endoscopic endonasal approaches	Accessing intra- and extradural tumors via an endonasal approach requires working safely in a relatively narrow area with unobstructed visibility. The authors describe their experience to highlight the utility of a side-cutting aspiration device for endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base tumors. The authors used this device in 13 nonconsecutive endoscopic endonasal procedures for different skull base tumors (8 pituitary macroadenomas, 2 craniopharyngiomas, 1 chordoma, 1 recurrent ependymoma, and 1 lymphoma). Illustrative cases and video are presented to demonstrate its use. The instrument was easy to use and effective in the removal of the lesions presented in this series. In 10 patients (77%), gross-total resection was possible; in the other 3 patients (23%), more than 80% of the tumor was resected. No collateral tissue damage or any other complication resulted from device-related debulking or aspiration. The side-cutting tissue resector is a safe, easy to use, and effective tool for internal debulking and extracapsular dissection of nonvascularized tumors that are too firm for bimanual suction or blunt ring curette dissection. It is particularly useful when working through a deep and narrow corridor such as is encountered in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3

Epithelioid angiosarcoma (EA) is a rarer, more aggressive form of angiosarcoma most common in men in their seventh decade. Dacron<sup>®</sup>, a polymer comprised of polyethylene terephthalate used in endografts for abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, has been a suspected carcinogen associated with EA. Currently, three case reports exist in the literature purporting Dacron<sup>®</sup>-associated epithelioid angiosarcoma. Herein we report a case of Dacron<sup>®</sup>-associated EA.<br/> A 64-year-old male with a recent history of a repaired type 2 endoleak and Dacron<sup>®</sup> endograft for his AAA presented with a painful skin eruption, fever, and weight loss. On exam, erythematous and violaceous papules and nodules were present on the patient's lower back. Biopsy revealed atypical, epithelioid cells forming vascular channels in a sheet-like and infiltrative pattern. These results and subsequent immunostaining were consistent with the diagnosis of EA. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed metastatic angiosarcoma.<br/> This case further highlights Dacron<sup>®</sup> as a rare, but, potential carcinogen associated with EA. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(7):897-899.

In our hospital, only three cases of CD in the head and neck region have been encountered in the past 20 years. To establish a database of Castleman's disease in Taiwan and to compare it to published western studies, we collected case reports of CD in the head and neck region in Taiwan from 1992 to 2007. We used ""Castleman's disease"" and ""Taiwan"" as keywords to search medical journal databases. A total of 15 cases were incorporated in our study, including three from our own hospital. These data were integrated for studying the disease characteristics in Taiwan. Submandibular area (level I) was the most commonly involved site (5 cases, 33.3%). The ratio of unicentric to multicentric CD and the proportion of histological classifications were similar to those in the western studies included in our review. All of the unicentric CD treated by complete resection showed no evidence of recurrence. Multicentric CD was present in two patients, although one died following a heart attack. The other multicentric CD patient was treated by medication and survived for several years. The features of head and neck CD in Taiwan are similar to those reported in western studies. Although CD is not a common disease, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with a neck mass, especially when the patient is suffering from long-term inflammation. Multicentric CD is also likely to be initially misdiagnosed as unicentric CD. It is important to remember that all patients diagnosed with CD should receive a systemic survey to exclude the possibility of ignored lesions."

101	30062132	51868470	The effects of nasal closure on quality of life in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	Epistaxis is the most common symptom of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Complete nasal closure is one of the treatment options for patients with severe, intractable epistaxis. In our experience, this surgery can be life changing in a positive sense; but many patients as well as their physicians understandably fear that such a procedure will diminish certain aspects of quality of life (QOL). Case-control study of HHT patients treated at the University of Utah HHT Center of Excellence with and without nasal closure from January 2005 to January 2016. Patients were matched according to epistaxis severity. Each included patient was issued three surveys: Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE). After treatment, the mean PSQI and NOSE scores were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the mean ESS score in the nasal closure group was significantly lower at 1.10 compared to the severe epistaxis group with a mean score of 3.99 (P = .027). The results of this study demonstrate that nasal closure significantly improves epistaxis severity without having a significant effect on sleep or nasal obstruction as they relate to QOL. These findings suggest that nasal closure should be considered for HHT patients with chronic severe epistaxis. 4.	Labeled	other	1
102	20302725	663759	Clinical features and surgical treatment of thoracic Castleman's disease	To explore the clinical features and surgical treatment of thoracic Castleman's disease. The clinical symptoms, pathological, laboratory, CT findings and results of surgery in 32 patients with Castleman's disease from June 1996 to November 2008 were evaluated. Among the 32 patients, there were 14 male and 18 female, aged from 16 to 48 years old with a mean age of 34.2 years old. Thirteen cases had symptoms including short of breath, irritable cough, or chest pain, while 14 cases had no symptoms. Mediastinal or hilar tumors were found by CT examination. Tumor was surgically removed in all the 32 patients except one died with anesthetic accident. Castleman's disease was conformed by pathology. Five cases were diagnosed as with paraneoplastic pemphigus, 3 of them were attacked by bronchiolitis obliterans. All 5 cases were failed by the use of prednisone. The signs of PNP were dissolved after operation, but pulmonary lesions failed to improve. There was no recurrence in all cases. PNP and lung abnormalities are the rare and severe complications of thoracic Castleman's disease. Surgical resection of the tumor is the first choice for treatment.

103	28806327	4628293	Long-term Quality of Life Following Vestibular Schwannoma Excision Via the Translabyrinthine Approach	To assess postoperative quality of life (QOL) and other patient-reported outcomes following surgery for vestibular schwannoma. Cross-sectional retrospective case review using postal questionnaires. Tertiary referral center. Five hundred consecutive patients undergoing surgery for vestibular schwannoma. Patients undergoing surgery via the translabyrinthine approach (excluding neurofibromatosis type 2) under the senior author, with a minimum of 5 years follow-up, were included. QOL was assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire and a disease-specific survey to assess patients' subjective outcomes. The SF-36 scores in this group were significantly lower than the general UK population, though 24% of respondents reported a subjective improvement in overall QOL. Tumors larger than 4 cm were related to a reduced SF-36 total mental component score (p = 0.037). Increased age at time of surgery correlated with a reduced physical component of QOL (correlation coefficient = -0.26) and an improved mental component (correlation coefficient = 0.26). Subjective reports of postoperative symptoms and return to work, driving and social activities were similar to other published studies. 35% of patients reported vivid dreams or nightmares following surgery; the first reported incidence of this phenomenon in a large group of vestibular schwannoma patients. Generic measures of QOL in patients following translabyrinthine surgery for vestibular schwannoma do not always match subjective reports, reflecting the complexity of QOL assessment and the range of outcomes in this group. Increased time since surgery appears to be associated with an improvement in mental health.	Labeled	other	1
104	21041171	24619295	A case of hypercalcemia associated with Castleman disease.	"OBJECTIVE
To present a case of hypercalcemia associated with Castleman disease.


METHODS
The details of case presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are reviewed in a 25-year-old woman with severe hypercalcemia, joint pain, conjunctival injection, and lymphadenopathy.


RESULTS
Endocrinopathies such as primary hyperparathyroidism were ruled out. Infectious and rheumatologic laboratory evaluations revealed normal results. On a whole-body scan, the patient was noted to have diffusely increased osseous uptake in conjunction with increased periarticular uptake, consistent with a metabolic superscan. After extensive evaluation, the patient underwent a right axillary lymph node biopsy and was found to have multicentric Castleman disease. She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and eventually immunomodulators to help control her disease.


CONCLUSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case report demonstrating hypercalcemia in association with Castleman disease. The pathologic mechanism is likely bone turnover mediated by cytokines such as interleukin-6."	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
105	20455025	10334223	Survey of familial glioma and role of germline p16INK4A/p14ARF and p53 mutation	There is increasing recognition of familial propensity to glioma as a distinct clinical entity beyond a few rare syndromes; however its genetic basis is poorly understood. The role of p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) and p53 mutations in sporadic glioma provides a strong rationale for investigating germline mutations in these genes as a cause of familial glioma. To survey the familial glioma phenotype and examine the contribution of germline mutation in p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) and p53 to the disease we have analyzed a series of 101 index familial cases collected through the GLIOGENE Consortium (http://braintumor.epigenetic.org/). There was little evidence for within family correlations for tumour histology, suggesting generic susceptibility to glial tumors. We did not detect any functional mutations in p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF). One index case with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed at age 54 and had a family history comprised of a paternal aunt with GBM at age 55, carried the p53 R158H mutation, which is predicted to be functional and has previously been implicated as a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Our findings provide no evidence that p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF) and p53 mutations contribute significantly to familial glioma.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

The purpose of this article is to review important imaging and clinical features to help elucidate causes of lymphadenopathy in patients with HIV infection. CONCLUSION. HIV lymphadenopathy has various causes generally categorized as inflammatory or reactive, such as immune reconstitution syndrome; infectious, such as tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and HIV infection itself; and neoplastic, such as lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and Castleman disease. It is important to consider patients' demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, CD4 lymphocyte counts, and radiologic features to identify likely causes of lymphadenopathy.

108	11592818	31023468	Characterization of the murine gene corresponding to human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 3: exclusion of the Subtle gray (sut) locus	Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) consists of oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis due to absent platelet dense bodies. In addition to exhibiting considerable phenotypic variation, this autosomal recessive disorder displays locus heterogeneity. One causative gene is HPS1, coding for a protein of unknown function and resulting in HPS-1 disease, common in northwest Puerto Rico. A second HPS-causing gene is ADTB3A, coding for the beta3A subunit of adaptor complex-3 (AP-3, a coat protein complex) and resulting in HPS-2 disease. Each of these HPS subtypes has a murine counterpart, specifically pale ear for HPS-1 and pearl for HPS-2. Recently, the HPS3 gene, responsible for HPS-3 disease in a genetic isolate of central Puerto Rico, was isolated and characterized. Its location on human chromosome 3q24 suggested that the mouse model corresponding to HPS-3 disease might be subtle gray. To examine this possibility, we determined the mouse HPS3 sequence, its genomic organization, and its amino acid sequence, which shares 95.8% identity with the human protein. We demonstrated that the subtle gray mouse produces a normal size and amount of HPS3 mRNA and has an entirely normal sequence in every exon and intron/exon boundary. Furthermore, subtle gray exhibits a normal contingent of platelet dense bodies. Together, these data eliminate subtle gray as a murine model for HPS-3 disease and suggest that other mouse models be examined.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
109	20512480	6285687	MET overexpressing chordomas frequently exhibit polysomy of chromosome 7 but no MET activation through sarcoma-specific gene fusions	Overexpression of MET and polysomy 7 was formerly demonstrated in chordomas. We investigated mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) protein expression and copy numbers of chromosome 7 in human chordomas. Furthermore, tumors were screened for gene fusions (PAX3-FKHR, ASPL-TFE3, and SYT-SSX) previously shown to be associated with MET activation in sarcomas. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from 66 chordoma samples. MET protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an immunoreactive score (IRS, scores 0-12). fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a dual-color DNA probe (7q31) for MET amplification was performed on TMA sections and RT-PCR for PAX3-FKHR, ASPL-TFE3 (type 1 + 2), and SYT-SSX (type 1 + 2) gene fusions on punch biopsies. All tumors (n = 66) expressed MET protein. FISH analysis of 33 tumors lacked MET gene amplification but showed polysomy of chromosome 7 in 15 (45.5%) tumors (13 low and two high polysomies). Although, polysomy 7 showed an increasing incidence with escalating MET IRS, this finding was not statistically significant. PAX3-FKHR, ASPL-TFE3, or SYT-SSX gene fusions were not demonstrable (n = 52). We found MET protein expression in all chordomas. A clear influence of polysomy 7 on MET protein expression could not be statistically demonstrated for this cohort. Moreover, gene fusions with the ability to cause MET overexpression do not occur in chordomas.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

We sought to determine the activity of erlotinib for progressive vestibular schwannoma (VS) associated with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). Retrospective case review. Tertiary referral center. Eleven NF2 patients with progressive VS who were poor candidates for standard therapy. Erlotinib 150 mg daily. A radiographic response was defined as >or= 20% decrease in tumor volume compared with baseline. A hearing response was defined as a statistically significant increase in word recognition score (WRS) compared with baseline; a minor hearing response was defined as a 10 dB improvement in pure-tone average with stable WRS. : Before treatment, the median and mean annual volumetric growth rate for 11 index VS were 26% and 46%, respectively. Among 10 evaluable patients, the median time-to-tumor progression was 9.2 months. Three patients with stable disease experienced maximum tumor shrinkage of 4%, 13%, and 14%. Nine patients underwent audiologic evaluations. One experienced a transient hearing response, 2 experienced minor hearing responses, 3 remained stable, and 2 developed progressive hearing loss. The median time-to-progressive hearing loss was 9.2 months and to either tumor growth or progressive hearing loss was 7.1 months. Adverse treatment effects included mild-to-moderate rash, diarrhea, and hair thinning, with 2 episodes of grade 3 toxicity. Erlotinib treatment was not associated with radiographic or hearing responses in NF2 patients with progressive VS. Because a subset of patients experienced prolonged stable disease, time-to-progression may be more appropriate than radiographic or hearing response for anti-EGFR agents in NF2-associated VS.

Explanted cells and sheets of nasal epithelium form fully differentiated spheroids enclosing a partly fluid-filled lumen with the ciliated apical surface facing the outside and accessible for analysis of ciliary function. We performed a two-group comparison study of ciliary beat pattern and ciliary beat frequency in spheroids derived from nasal airway epithelium in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and in healthy controls. Nasal ciliary cells and sheets were removed on day 1 by nasal brush biopsy and analyzed with regard to ciliary beat pattern-and frequency using high-speed video imaging for standard reference values. Three-dimensional explant spheroid formation was initiated in the same individual on the same day by incubation of cells and sheets from a separate brush biopsy. Harvested spheroids were analyzed earliest possible and values of spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were compared to the corresponding reference values from day 1. Spheroids formed fast in serum-free culture medium. Formation was successful in 15 out of 18 (82%) sampled individuals. Thus, formation was successful in seven healthy controls and eight PCD patients, while unsuccessful in 3 with PCD due to infection. Median (range) number of days in culture before harvesting of spheroids was 4 (1-5) in healthy versus 2 (1-5) in PCD. Spheroid ciliary beat pattern and frequency were unchanged compared to their corresponding day 1 standard reference values. Spheroid ciliary beat frequency discriminated highly significant between healthy controls (9.3 Hz) and PCD patients (2.4 Hz) (P < 0.0001). Survival of spheroids was 16 days in a single healthy person. Patient-specific three-dimensional explant spheroid formation from a minimal invasive nasal brush biopsy is a feasible, fast and valid ex vivo method to assess ciliary function with potential of aiding the diagnosis of PCD. In addition, it may be a useful model in the investigation of pathophysiological aspects and drug effects in human nasal airway epithelium.

113	33764203	232356375	Evolution of Infantile Spasms to Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: What Is There to Know?	Objective: Children with infantile spasms may develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The diagnostic criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are vague, and many experts use varying combinations of the following criteria for diagnosis: paroxysmal fast activity on electroencephalography (EEG), slow spike and wave on EEG, developmental delay, multiple seizure types, and nocturnal tonic seizures. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in a high-risk cohort of children with a history of infantile spasms and the characteristics of infantile spasms that were associated with the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Methods: Children with infantile spasms who were diagnosed and treated at Children’s Hospital Colorado between 2012 and 2018 were included. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was defined as having 3 of 5 of the following characteristics: paroxysmal fast activity, slow spike and wave, current developmental delay, multiple seizure types, or tonic seizures. Descriptive statistics were performed using median and interquartile range. Univariable analysis was performed with Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact, or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Ninety-seven children met inclusion criteria, and 36% (35/97) met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Developmental delay and history of seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms were identified as risk factors for the development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .003) as was poor response to first treatment for spasms (P = .004). Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (P = .019). Eighty percent (28/35) of the children who met Lennox-Gastaut syndrome criteria lacked a documented diagnosis. Conclusions: Thirty-six percent of children with infantile spasms met criteria for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Risk factors for development of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were developmental delay and seizures prior to the onset of infantile spasms and poor response to first treatment for infantile spasms. Children with an unknown etiology of infantile spasms were less likely to develop Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eighty percent of the children who met our criteria were not given a documented diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which highlights the fact that many children may not be receiving a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We recommend establishing clear guidelines for the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome to ensure that the diagnosis is being made accurately.

116	10841946	7575291	Trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in human B-lymphoblasts deficient in the AP-3 adaptor complex	The major histocompatibility complex class II subunits (MHC-II) alpha and beta assemble with the invariant chain (Ii) in the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported to endosomal-lysosomal organelles known as MHC class II compartments (MIICs). Although it has been shown that two dileucine-based signals in the cytosolic tail of Ii, as well as a dileucine-based signal in the tail of the beta chain mediate sorting to MIICs, the molecular mechanisms by which alphabetaIi complexes are sorted have yet to be resolved fully. The AP-3 adaptor complex stands out as a particularly good candidate for mediating this targeting because: (i) it has a proven role in the trafficking of membrane proteins to lysosome-related organelles; and (ii) it has the ability to interact with dileucine-based signals in vitro. To investigate the potential role of AP-3 in transport of MHC-II to MIICs, we have examined MHC-II trafficking in human B-lymphoblast lines from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS-2), which are deficient in the AP-3 complex. Pulse-chase analyses revealed no significant alteration in the kinetics of synthesis and degradation of either MHC-II subunits or Ii. Moreover, we observed neither impairment of the formation of compact SDS-resistant alphabeta dimers, nor delay in the appearance of a conformational epitope indicative of a mature, Ii-free alphabeta dimer. Finally, we demonstrated that in HPS-2 patients' cells, there was no delay in the expression of the alphabeta dimers on the cell surface. Thus, AP-3 does not seem to be essential for normal trafficking of MHC-II. These findings have important implications for HPS-2 patients, because they suggest that the recurrent bacterial infections suffered by these patients are not likely due to impaired antigen processing and presentation by MHC-II.

It is characterized by a triad of dextrocardia (with or without situs inversus), chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis as a result of poor mucociliary clearance of mucus and bacteria. This may lead to respiratory distress in the newborn period. This is a case report of a 14-day old male who presented with respiratory distress (which was noticed soon afterbirth) and features suggestive of KS.

A 22-year-old immunocompromised woman with adult-onset Still's disease developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Digital subtraction angiography revealed a small aneurysm at the M2-3 bifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery. Cardiac ultrasonography showed vegetation at the posterior cardiac wall, suspecting infective endocarditis (IE). Gram-positive filamentous bacteria were observed in the necrotic tissue surrounding the aneurysm obtained during trapping surgery. Long-term blood culture showed that the cause of her cerebral mycotic aneurysm was nocardiosis. A mycotic ruptured cerebral aneurysm is an important cause of SAH in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis of IE, detection of gram-positive rods by Gram staining, and long-term culture to identify the bacteria is crucial in diagnosing nocardiosis.

119	24525918	31510265	Appreciating the broad clinical features of SMAD4 mutation carriers: a multicenter chart review	Heterozygous loss-of-function SMAD4 mutations are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Some carriers exhibit symptoms of both conditions, leading to juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. Three families have been reported with connective tissue abnormalities. To better understand the spectrum and extent of clinical findings in SMAD4 carriers, medical records of 34 patients (20 families) from five clinical practices were reviewed. Twenty-one percent of the patients (7/34) had features suggesting a connective tissue defect: enlarged aortic root (n = 3), aortic and mitral insufficiency (n = 2), aortic dissection (n = 1), retinal detachment (n = 1), brain aneurysms (n = 1), and lax skin and joints (n = 1). Juvenile polyposis-specific findings were almost uniformly present but variable. Ninety-seven percent of the patients had colon polyps that were generally pan-colonic and of variable histology and number. Forty-eight percent of the patients (15/31) had extensive gastric polyposis. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia features, including epistaxis (19/31, 61%), mucocutaneous telangiectases (15/31, 48%), liver arteriovenous malformation (6/16, 38%), brain arteriovenous malformation (1/26, 4%), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (9/17, 53%), and intrapulmonary shunting (14/23, 61%), were documented in 76% of the patients. SMAD4 carriers should be managed for juvenile polyposis and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia because symptoms of both conditions are likely yet unpredictable. Connective tissue abnormalities are an emerging component of juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome, and larger studies are needed to understand these manifestations.

120	24939148	19854317	Malignant pleuropulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma - unusual presentation of an aggressive angiogenic neoplasm	Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) of the lung and pleura are rare tumors. Primary pleural EHE are associated with aggressive behavior and poor clinical outcome. Recent advances in EHE include the development of immunohistochemical markers of vascular differentiation, namely Fli-1, and the identification of a specific chromosomal translocation (t(1;3)(p36;q25)). We present a 19 year old male patient with a rapidly progressive malignant neoplasm that presented as a multinodular lung parenchymal process, with associated pleural effusion and thickening. Pathologic examination revealed a pleuropulmonary neoplasm with cytologic features including round to oval epithelioid cells with frequent cytoplasmic vacuoles. Immunohistochemistry confirmed vascular differentiation of tumor cells (CD34, CD31 and Fli-1 positive). While the cytologic features were suggestive of EHE, the aggressive nature of the neoplasm, with disseminated pleuropulmonary involvement, raised the question of whether the neoplasm should be classified as EHE or epithelioid angiosarcoma. Here, we review the clinicopathologic characteristics of pleuropulmonary EHE and the overlap between malignant EHE and angiosarcoma.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
121	1664950	3878665	Characterization of neurotensin(6-13) from an hepatic fibrolamellar carcinoma	Neurotensin(6-13) has been isolated and sequenced as the major form of neurotensin-like immunoreactivity (NTLI) in a human hepatic fibrolamellar carcinoma. Circulating NTLI in the patient, especially C-terminal, was very high. In additional studies, NT(6-13) was synthesized and compared with the purified tumor NTLI by HPLC analysis and by testing stability in plasma in vitro. These methods confirmed that the tumor NTLI was identical to NT(6-13). Since the metabolic clearance rate of synthetic NT(6-13) in sheep was 30-fold higher than NT(1-13), it suggests that the elevated plasma levels are the result of impaired clearance and/or markedly elevated production.

122	22281384	25134681	Post-section recruitment of epileptiform discharges in electrocorticography during callosotomy in 48 patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	We aimed to clarify the relationships between post-sectional recruitment of epileptiform discharges (PRED) seen in electrocorticograms (ECoG) during callosotomy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and postoperative seizure outcome. We retrospectively analyzed ECoG obtained during subtotal callosotomy (6 cm) in 48 patients with LGS (32 males, 16 females; age range, 1-20 years; mean age, 7.6 years) from July 1993 to November 1996 and compared recorded findings with postoperative seizure outcome. At analysis, all patients had been followed postoperatively for more than 10 years. Of 48 patients, 15 (31.3%) had PRED in their post-section ECoG. Of these patients, 11 (73%) achieved significant (at least 50%) overall seizure reduction postoperatively. The phenomenon of PRED in callosotomy did not predict a better postoperative seizure outcome (p>0.05). We concluded that post-sectional ECoG recruitment of electrical discharges during callosotomy did not predict postoperative prognosis. However, this finding should be supported and elucidated by further studies. The heterogenous ECoG findings during callosotomy in our series might suggest a complicated role of the corpus callosum in the epileptogenesis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

123	25172615	21416576	How to identify pediatric cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformation earlier: non-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia case	Cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are well known respectively by doctors. However, there are few cases that a single patient suffers both cerebral AVM and pulmonary AVM. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is universally accepted as an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which represents telangiectasia is frequently multiple AVMs in internal organs. Very few non-HHT cases were diagnosed as cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. We report one case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs diagnosed as non-HHT to share our experience. This report aims to find the way of identifying non-HHT case with cerebral and pulmonary AVMs in early periods. To our knowledge, the primary goals in the treatment are early identification and intervention to prevent bleeding secondary to child cerebral hematoma. For these cases, systemic examination is necessary. If one child suffered cerebral hematoma and also suffers polypnea cyanosis and respiratory distress simultaneously, which indicates signs of oxygen deprivation, a pulmonary CT and brain CT should be performed without delay except for all efforts to diagnose cerebral AVM. All cases in childhood suffered cerebral hematoma and other systemic disorder, more detailed examination was necessary. Most cases were diagnosed as multiple AVMs. A cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and bronchoscope are necessary to reveal AVMs in the brain and lung.

124	15929019	22228177	Pulmonary hypertension in hereditary haemorrhagic teleangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber disease)	Progression over 10 years. 10 years ago a now 49-year-old woman with Render-Osler-Weber disease showed unspecific symptoms of nausea, and general unwellness. Pulmonary manifestation of the disease was accompanied by pulmonary hypertension. Teleangiectasia of the tongue and pharynx as well as of the mucosa of mouth and nose were observed. Fixed-splitting of the second heart sound with accentuated pulmonary component and a 2/6 systolic murmur over the tricuspid valve were heard. In addition, a murmur was heard dorsal over the right lung's lower lobe. Apart from minor oedema of both ankles, the physical status was not remarkable. Echocardiography showed dilatation of the right ventricle and a minor regurgitation of the tricuspid valve. The computed tomography showed dilatation of the pulmonary arteries as well as an arteriovenous malformation in the right lower lobe. Right-heart catheterisation revealed elevated pulmonary pressure. THERAPY AND FOLLOW-UP: Initial treatment with a calcium channel blocker proved insufficient and was changed to inhalative, and later to oral prostanoids. Under this treatment the cardiopulmonary state was stabilised, but episodes of epistaxis were increased. Two years after readjustment of the medication to a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, the cardiopulmonary state remains stable without significant haemorrhagic complications. Prostanoid treatment in patients with Render-Osler-Weber disease and additional pulmonary hypertension can lead to an increased risk of haemorrhagic complications. Treatment with newer medications, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, seems indicated as successfully illustrated in our case.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
125	7574460	24173118	Autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy and speech dyspraxia: a new syndrome with anticipation	We describe a family of 9 affected individuals in three generations with nocturnal oro-facio-brachial partial seizures, secondarily generalized partial seizures, and centro-temporal epileptiform discharges, associated with oral and speech dyspraxia and cognitive impairment. The speech disorder was prominent, but differed from that of Landau-Kleffner syndrome and of epilepsy with continuous spike and wave during slow-wave sleep. The electroclinical features of this new syndrome of autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy resemble those of benign rolandic epilepsy, a common inherited epilepsy of childhood. This family shows clinical anticipation of the seizure disorder, the oral and speech dyspraxia, and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that the genetic mechanism could be expansion of an unstable triplet repeat. Molecular studies on this syndrome, where the inheritance pattern is clear, could also be relevant to identifying a gene for benign rolandic epilepsy where anticipation does not occur and the mode of inheritance is uncertain.

126	14630615	18473821	Investigation of the possible role of a novel gene, DPCD, in primary ciliary dyskinesia	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations that affect the proper function of cilia. Recently, deletion of DNA polymerase lambda (Poll) in mice produced a phenotype characteristic of PCD (Kobayashi et al., 2002, Mol. Cell. Biol. 22:2769-2776). Because it is unclear how a mutation in a DNA polymerase would result in a specific defect in axonemes, the targeting construct was examined further. Analysis of the genomic region surrounding the Poll gene revealed an uncharacterized gene, named Dpcd, that is predicted to be transcribed from the opposite strand relative to Poll. The deletion of Poll would also remove the first exon of Dpcd. Because it is possible that the PCD phenotype observed is due to the absence of either gene, the expression of these genes during ciliogenesis of human airway epithelial cells was examined. Northern analysis demonstrated that DPCD expression increases during ciliated cell differentiation; the expression of POLL decreases. To examine directly whether DPCD is mutated in cases of human PCD, the complete coding sequence of DPCD was sequenced from 51 unrelated PCD patients. No disease-causing mutations were confirmed; however, one variant could not be excluded. Therefore, DPCD remains a novel candidate gene for PCD.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

Autopsy showed normal tests for age and normal Wolffian duct structures. The serum testosterone level was unusually high, suggesting that the failure of virilization of the external genitalia in the child might be due to a defect in testosterone conversion to dihydrotestosterone or a lack of end-organ receptors for the same. An additional feature not previously described in association with SLO syndrome was present, which was clinical hypoglycemia with nesidioblastosis.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
128	21838880	2249984	Unicentric castleman's disease located in the lower extremity: a case report	Castleman's disease is a rare form of localized lymph node hyperplasia of uncertain etiology. Although the mediastinum is the most common site of involvement, rare cases occurring in lymph node bearing tissue of other localization have been reported, including only a few intramuscular cases. Unicentric and multicentric Castleman's disease are being distinguished, the latter harboring an unfavorable prognosis. Here, we present a case of unicentric Castleman's disease in a 37-year-old woman without associated neoplastic, autoimmune or infectious diseases. The lesion was located in the femoral region of the right lower extremity and surgically resected after radiographic workup and excisional biopsy examinations. The tumor comprised lymphoid tissue with numerous germinal centers with central fibrosis, onion-skinning and rich interfollicular vascularization. CD23-positive follicular dendritic cells were detected in the germinal centers and numerous CD138-positive plasma cells in interfollicular areas. The diagnosis of mixed cellularity type Castleman's disease was established and the patient recovered well. In conclusion, the differential diagnosis of Castleman's disease should be considered when evaluating a sharply demarcated, hypervascularized lymphatic tumor located in the extremities. However, the developmental etiology of Castleman's disease remains to be further examined.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
129	26432887	17012122	The zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle as a model system for the molecular mechanisms by which the lack of Polycystin-2 leads to stimulation of CFTR	In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), cyst inflation and continuous enlargement are associated with marked transepithelial ion and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Indeed, the inhibition or degradation of CFTR prevents the fluid accumulation within cysts. The in vivo mechanisms by which the lack of Polycystin-2 leads to CFTR stimulation are an outstanding challenge in ADPKD research and may bring important biomarkers for the disease. However, hampering their study, the available ADPKD in vitro cellular models lack the three-dimensional architecture of renal cysts and the ADPKD mouse models offer limited access for live-imaging experiments in embryonic kidneys. Here, we tested the zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle (KV) as an alternative model-organ. KV is a fluid-filled vesicular organ, lined by epithelial cells that express both CFTR and Polycystin-2 endogenously, being each of them easily knocked-down. Our data on the intracellular distribution of Polycystin-2 support its involvement in the KV fluid-flow induced Ca(2+)-signalling. Mirroring kidney cysts, the KV lumen inflation is dependent on CFTR activity and, as we clearly show, the knockdown of Polycystin-2 results in larger KV lumens through overstimulation of CFTR. In conclusion, we propose the zebrafish KV as a model organ to study the renal cyst inflation. Favouring its use, KV volume can be easily determined by in vivo imaging offering a live readout for screening compounds and genes that may prevent cyst enlargement through CFTR inhibition.

In this double blind, placebo controlled trial, 15 adult patients with HHT with a minimum of 2 epistaxis episodes per week were randomized. A history of thromboembolic events or recent or planned surgery led to exclusion. Patients received a single intranasal submucosal injection (10 mL) of 100 mg bevacizumab or placebo. The primary outcome was the relative reduction of average daily epistaxis visual analog score (VAS). Average daily posttreatment VAS scores decreased by 27% in the bevacizumab group and by 3% in the placebo group (p = .57). The reduction in HHT epistaxis severity scores was -0.61 greater in the bevacizumab group compared to the placebo group (p = .34). Results show a trend toward reduced epistaxis with bevacizumab. This further supports the use of bevacizumab in HHT. Clincial Trials. gov number: NCT01314274"	Labeled	patient-based therapeutics	4
133	7568035	21135326	Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts homozygous for p53 mutations are deficient in global DNA repair but exhibit normal transcription-coupled repair and enhanced UV resistance	We investigated whether mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene alter UV sensitivity and/or repair of UV-induced DNA damage in primary human skin fibroblasts from patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, heterozygous for mutations in one allele of the p53 gene (p53 wt/mut) and sublines expressing only mutant p53 (p53 mut). The p53 mut cells were more resistant than the p53 wt/mut cells to UV cytotoxicity and exhibited less UV-induced apoptosis. DNA repair analysis revealed reduced removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from overall genomic DNA in vivo in p53 mut cells compared with p53 wt/mut or normal cells. However, p53 mut cells retained the ability to preferentially repair damage in the transcribed strands of expressed genes (transcription-coupled repair). These results suggest that loss of p53 function may lead to greater genomic instability by reducing the efficiency of DNA repair but that cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents may be enhanced through elimination of apoptosis.

Other determinants of the lesional phenotype are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the influence of high vascular flow rates on ALK1+/- mice by manipulating cerebral blood flow (CBF) using vasodilators. Adult male ALK1+/- mice underwent adeno-associated viral-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (AAVVEGF) or lacZ (AAVlacZ as a control) gene transfer into the brain. Two weeks after vector injection, hydralazine or nicardipine was infused intraventricularly for another 14 days. CBF was measured to evaluate relative tissue perfusion. We analyzed the number and morphology of capillaries. Results demonstrated that hydralazine or nicardipine infusion increased focal brain perfusion in all mice. It was noted that focal CBF increased most in AAVVEGF-injected ALK1+/- mice following hydralazine or nicardipine infusion (145+/-23% or 150+/-11%; P<0.05). There were more detectable dilated and dysplastic capillaries (2.4+/-0.3 or 2.0+/-0.4 dysplasia index; P<0.01) in the brains of ALK1+/- mice treated with AAVVEGF and hydralazine or nicardipine compared with the mice treated with them individually. We concluded that increased focal tissue perfusion and angiogenic factor VEGF stimulation could have a synergistic effect to promote capillary dysplasia in a genetic deficit animal model, which may have relevance to further studies of AVMs.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
135	1581912	40713302	Inherited p53 gene mutations in breast cancer	Recent evidence has implicated germ-line mutations of the p53 gene as the cause of cancer susceptibility in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, associated with the development of breast cancer and other neoplasms. Furthermore, somatic mutations of the p53 gene have been detected in a high percentage of non-familial breast cancers. We therefore sought to identify potential carriers of p53 gene mutations in a cohort of patients with early onset breast cancer. We examined 126 consecutive patients who developed breast cancer at or before the age of 40 for mutations of p53 within conserved regions of the gene. One patient with an inherited germ-line mutation of the p53 gene was identified but the functional significance of this mutation was not clear. It thus appears that only a small percentage of patients with breast cancer under the age of 40 carry germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, an observation which has implications for potential screening and risk assessment in such patients.

Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY) and the enzyme; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) all regulate appetite and glucose homeostasis. These proteins have been identified as possible contributors to HH but the mechanism remains poorly understood. We aimed to look at the expression pattern of pancreatic DPP-4 in children with focal and diffuse CHI (FCHI and DCHI, respectively). Using immunohistochemistry; we determined DPP-4 expression patterns in the pancreas of CHI patients. DPP-4 was found to be expressed in the pancreatic β, α and δ-cells in and around the focal area. However, it was predominantly co-localised with β-cells in the paediatric tissue samples. Additionally, proliferating β-cells expressed DPP-4 in DCHI, which was absent in the FCHI pancreas. Insulin was found to be present in the exocrine acini and duct cells of the DCHI pancreas suggestive of exocrine to endocrine transdifferentiation. Furthermore, 6 medically-unresponsive DCHI pancreatic samples showed an up-regulation of total pancreatic DPP-4 expression. In conclusion; the expression studies have shown DPP-4 to be altered in HH, however, further work is required to understand the underlying role for this enzyme.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

This can be difficult when bacteria are multiresistant. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the tolerance and efficiency of ceftazidime and aztreonam combination (+/-tobramycin, +/-ciprofloxacin) in the treatment of acute exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients who were chronically colonized with multiresistant P. aeruginosa. Seventeen severe patients, with FEV(1)=1070+/-66 mL and BMI=18+/-0.6 kg/m(2), who had chronic colonisation with P. aeruginosa with intermediate sensitivity or resistance to ceftazidime and aztreonam, were studied between June 2003 and March 2007. Oxygen saturation, dyspnoea, weight, FEV(1), FVC, and tolerance were evaluated before and after antibiotic courses. Forty-two courses of treatment, administered between June 2003 and March 2007 were studied: Patients increased their FEV(1) and FVC (p=0.01). One antibiotic course was stopped after four days because of cutaneous side effects. The median delay until the next exacerbation was 101+/-10 days. These courses were compared with other combinations of antibiotics that the patients had received before. The combination of ceftazidime and aztreonam was more effective in patients receiving less than four courses per year for acute pulmonary exacerbation. In chronically P. aeruginosa colonised cystic fibrosis patients, ceftazidime and aztreonam combination (+/-tobramycin, +/-ciprofloxacin) is well tolerated and efficient. This treatment suggests a clinical and functional benefit is possible, even in patients with severe disease.	Gold Standard	therapeutics in the clinic	3
138	26481065	5003173	Endoglin is required in Pax3-derived cells for embryonic blood vessel formation	Mutations in endoglin, a TGFβ/BMP coreceptor, are causal for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Endoglin-null (Eng-/-) mouse embryos die at embryonic day (E)10.5-11.5 due to defects in angiogenesis. In part, this is due to an absence of vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation and vessel investment. Prior studies from our lab and others have shown the importance of endoglin expression in embryonic development in both endothelial cells and neural crest stem cells. These studies support the hypothesis that endoglin may play cell-autonomous roles in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell precursors. However, the requirement for endoglin in vascular cell precursors remains poorly defined. Our objective was to specifically delete endoglin in neural crest- and somite-derived Pax3-positive vascular precursors to understand the impact on somite progenitor cell contribution to embryonic vascular development. Pax3Cre mice were crossed with Eng+/- mice to obtain compound mutant Pax3(Cre/+);Eng+/- mice. These mice were then crossed with homozygous endoglin LoxP-mutated (Eng(LoxP/LoxP)) mice to conditionally delete the endoglin gene in specific lineages that contribute to endothelial and smooth muscle constituents of developing embryonic vessels. Pax3(Cre/+);Eng(LoxP/)(-) mice showed a variety of vascular defects at E10.5, and none of these mice survived past E12.5. Embryos analyzed at E10.5 showed malformations suggestive of misdirection of the intersomitic vessels. The dorsal aorta showed significant dilation with associated vascular smooth muscle cells exhibiting disorganization and enhanced expression of smooth muscle differentiation proteins, including smooth muscle actin. These results demonstrate a requirement for endoglin in descendants of Pax3-expressing vascular cell precursors, and thus provides new insight into the cellular basis underlying adult vascular diseases such as HHT.

MBL polymorphisms are associated with lung function decline in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). We performed sputum microbiology, spirometry pre- and post-administration of salbutamol, ciliary motion analysis, ultrastructural assessment of cilia, ciliogenesis in culture, and chest high resolution computed tomography in children with a clinical history of respiratory tract infections and/or presence of bronchiectasis suggestive of PCD or secondary ciliary dyskinesia (SCD). All subjects were evaluated for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding MBL-2. The diagnosis of PCD was established in 45 subjects, while in the remaining 53 the diagnosis was SCD. A significant bronchodilator response was observed only in PCD associated with the MBL2-3 genotype, which is known to be associated with low/undetectable MBL serum levels. Also, bronchiectasis severity was significantly greater in subjects with MBL2-3 in both PCD and SCD. No other association was found between MBL genotypes and clinical findings. MBL plays a relatively minor role as a disease modifier in PCD. A similar finding in SCD supports the likely significance of this result.	Gold Standard	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

We assessed the risk of neurological dysfunction from these malformations and fistulae. Three hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with HHT seen at a single institution over a 20-year period were studied. Any evidence of prior neurological symptoms or presence of an intracranial vascular malformation was recorded. All cases of possible cerebral arteriovenous malformation were confirmed by conventional arteriography. Twelve patients (3.7%) had a history of cerebral vascular malformations. Ten patients had arteriovenous malformations, 1 had a dural arteriovenous fistula, and 1 had a cavernous malformation. Seven patients (2.1%) presented with intracranial hemorrhage, 2 presented with seizures alone, and 3 were discovered incidentally. The average age at the time of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 25.4 years. All patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage were classified as Rankin grade I or II at a mean follow-up interval of 6.0 years. A history of cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack was found in 29.6% of patients with HHT and a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage is low among people with HHT. Furthermore, a majority of these patients have a good functional outcome after hemorrhage. The data do not suggest a compelling indication for routine screening of patients with HHT for asymptomatic cerebral vascular malformations. By comparison, pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae are a much more frequent cause of neurological symptoms in this population.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

At follow-up after ten and two months of treatment, liver enzymes were found to be increased [serum sirolimus level 1.4 ng/mL (normal range: 5-15), aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 298U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 302U/L and serum sirolimus level: 9.9 ng/mL, AST: 261U/L, ALT: 275U/L, respectively]. In Case 1, discontinuation of the drug resulted in normalization of liver enzymes within three days. Two days after normalization, sirolimus was restarted at a lower dose, which resulted in a repeated increase in transferases. In Case 2, a reduction of sirolimus dose caused normalization of liver enzymes within ten days. When the dose was increased, enzymes increased within three days. Sirolimus was discontinued in both cases. The rapid normalization of liver enzyme levels after sirolimus withdrawal or dose reduction; elevation of transaminases after restart or dose increase and rapid normalization after sirolimus withdrawal were findings strongly suggestive of sirolimus-induced hepatitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of sirolimus-induced hepatitis in CHI. Sirolimus is a promising drug for CHI patients who are unresponsive to medical treatment, but physicians should be vigilant for adverse effects on liver function.

145	23408511	6585997	A rational free energy-based approach to understanding and targeting disease-causing missense mutations	Intellectual disability is a condition characterized by significant limitations in cognitive abilities and social/behavioral adaptive skills and is an important reason for pediatric, neurologic, and genetic referrals. Approximately 10% of protein-encoding genes on the X chromosome are implicated in intellectual disability, and the corresponding intellectual disability is termed X-linked ID (XLID). Although few mutations and a small number of families have been identified and XLID is rare, collectively the impact of XLID is significant because patients usually are unable to fully participate in society. To reveal the molecular mechanisms of various intellectual disabilities and to suggest small molecules which by binding to the malfunctioning protein can reduce unwanted effects. Using various in silico methods we reveal the molecular mechanism of XLID in cases involving proteins with known 3D structure. The 3D structures were used to predict the effect of disease-causing missense mutations on the folding free energy, conformational dynamics, hydrogen bond network and, if appropriate, protein-protein binding free energy. It is shown that the vast majority of XLID mutation sites are outside the active pocket and are accessible from the water phase, thus providing the opportunity to alter their effect by binding appropriate small molecules in the vicinity of the mutation site. This observation is used to demonstrate, computationally and experimentally, that a particular condition, Snyder-Robinson syndrome caused by the G56S spermine synthase mutation, might be ameliorated by small molecule binding.

Rufinamide tablets were safe and effective as an add-on treatment in Korean children and adolescents <20 years of age with LGS. This subgroup analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rufinamide tablets in LGS pediatric patients aged 1-4 years. This was a retrospective, observational study in LGS patients aged 1-4 years who received 12 weeks of treatment with rufinamide orally as an adjuvant treatment between April and June 2010. The proportion of responders (patients with a ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency after rufinamide treatment) was evaluated according to the type of seizure. The proportion of patients who were seizure-free was also evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment. Among the 15 patients evaluated, one discontinued treatment because of worsening seizures 4 weeks after administration of rufinamide. Seven (46.67%) patients were responders and four patients were seizure-free. There were four responders with convulsive seizures, one each for myoclonic seizures and drop attacks, and spasms. The responder rate was increased to 69.23% by long-term treatment of rufinamide. AEs were experienced by three patients. One patient each experienced somnolence, fatigue, and rash. Rufinamide tablets were efficacious and well tolerated in LGS patients aged 1-4 years, at doses up to 1000 mg per day, when given as add-on therapy to other antiepileptic drugs.

147	17052934	9854068	Disease-associated Glut1 single amino acid substitute mutations S66F, R126C, and T295M constitute Glut1-deficiency states in vitro	Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS) is the result of autosomal-dominant loss-of-function mutation of the glucose transporter type 1 gene (GLUT1) leading to brain energy failure and epileptic encephalopathy. In this study, the protein products of the Glut1DS-associated GLUT1 missense mutations, S66F, R126C, and T295M, were characterized using the Glut1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion expressed in CHO cells. Glut1-GFP expression was confirmed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. The applicability of this Glut1-GFP expression model in reporting Glut1 functional deficits was validated by re-confirming the glucose transport defects of the previously reported pathogenic mutations R126H, R126L, and R333W. While S66F, R126C, and T295M mutants were expressed and targeted to the cell membrane, these Glut1 mutants have significantly diminished membrane association and glucose transport activity (p<0.05) relative to the wild-type Glut1 protein. Consistent with the reduced Glut1 membrane association, glucose transport kinetics studies showed that S66F, R126C, and T295M mutants have significantly reduced (p<0.05) Vmax but not Km. Thus, Glut1 single amino acid substitute mutants S66F, R126C, and T295M impair glucose transport function and constitute Glut1-deficiency states in vitro. These results support the pathogenicity of Glut1 S66F, R126C, and T295M in vivo.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

149	8951671	179749	Expression of the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, in Schwann cells	The neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes a protein with sequence similarity to a family of molecules linking cell membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Individuals affected with NF2 develop schwannomas at an increased frequency. In this paper, we report that merlin is expressed in Schwann cells, where it is localized in vitro to the cell membrane by immunohistochemistry and subcellular fractionation. Exogenous expression of merlin fragments confirms this subcellular distribution and suggests that both the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the molecule are required for this localization. In addition, merlin is expressed in rat sciatic nerve Schwann cells at paranodal membranes, where it colocalizes with RhoA. Lastly, expression of the NF2 gene increases during postnatal rat sciatic nerve development, consistent with its role as a negative growth regulator for Schwann cells. These results collectively suggest that merlin may function at the cell surface to modulate cell growth in Schwann cells and to link cell membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton.

150	30385632	53946086	Oncogenic role of SFRP2 in p53-mutant osteosarcoma development via autocrine and paracrine mechanism	Osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone tumor, is highly metastatic with high chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival rates. Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients, we investigate an oncogenic role of secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) in p53 mutation-associated OS development. Interestingly, we find that high SFRP2 expression in OS patient samples correlates with poor survival. Systems-level analyses identified that expression of SFRP2 increases during LFS OS development and can induce angiogenesis. Ectopic SFRP2 overexpression in normal osteoblast precursors is sufficient to suppress normal osteoblast differentiation and to promote OS phenotypes through induction of oncogenic molecules such as FOXM1 and CYR61 in a β-catenin-independent manner. Conversely, inhibition of SFRP2, FOXM1, or CYR61 represses the tumorigenic potential. In summary, these findings demonstrate the oncogenic role of SFRP2 in the development of p53 mutation-associated OS and that inhibition of SFRP2 is a potential therapeutic strategy.

151	21688173	20663198	Sex-specific effect of the TP53 PIN3 polymorphism on cancer risk in a cohort study of TP53 germline mutation carriers	Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 occur in the majority of families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, who are at an increased risk for a wide spectrum of early onset cancers. Several genetic polymorphisms in TP53 modify its effect on cancer risk. While some studies indicate that the TP53 PIN3 deletion allele (D) accelerate tumor onset in carriers with TP53 germline mutations, other studies have shown that the TP53 PIN3 insertion allele (I) confers a significantly higher risk of developing cancer than D allele. To further determine the effects of the TP53 PIN3 polymorphism on cancer development among TP53 germline mutations and to evaluate if those are differenence between male and female carriers, we studied a total of 152 germline mutation carriers with available DNA samples that can be used for genotyping. Our results indicate that the TP53 PIN3 polymorphism has a sex-specific effect on the risk of cancer in TP53 mutation carriers, conferring cancer risk in men (P = 0.0041) but not women with DI or II genotypes.

Corticosteroids induced clinical remission with resolution of fever, arthritis, and rash. While tapering corticosteroids, the patient developed severe liver enzymes elevation, very high ferritin levels and, subsequently, acute liver failure. After other causes of liver disease (infections, metabolic, autoimmune hepatitis, lymphoma, and hemophagocytosis) were excluded, severe hepatitis was attributed to AOSD itself. Cyclosporine induced rapid normalization of liver enzymes and reduction in ferritin levels. Severe hepatitis and very high ferritin levels could be the only manifestation of disease activity in AOSD; therefore, monitoring of liver enzymes and ferritin levels is recommended even after resolution of the clinical symptoms of AOSD. Prompt initiation of cyclosporine can improve liver function and prevent progression to liver failure.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
153	19630075	6509365	GLUT1 gene mutations cause sporadic paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesias	Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesias (PED) are involuntary intermittent movements triggered by prolonged physical exertion. Autosomal dominant inheritance may occur. Recently, mutations in the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) gene (chr. 1p35-p31.3) have been identified as a cause in some patients with autosomal dominant PED. Mutations in this gene have previously been associated with the GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. We performed mutational analysis in 10 patients with apparently sporadic PED. We identified two novel GLUT1 mutations, at least one likely to be de-novo, in two of our patients. Onset was in early childhood. One of our patients had a predating history of childhood absence epilepsy and a current history of hemiplegic migraine as well as a family history of migraine. The other patient had no other symptoms apart from PED. Brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy in one case. Mutations in GLUT1 are one cause of apparently sporadic PED. The detection of this has important implications for treatment as ketogenic diet has been reported to be beneficial.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

A controlled hypoglycemia screen was performed to measure levels of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and 3-β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. The pancreas was analyzed by fluorine-18-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET scan. Genetic analyses were performed on the peripheral blood leukocytes, and loss of heterozygosity within the resected focal lesion of the pancreas was investigated by microsatellite analysis. A glucagon stimulation test helped determine pituitary function, and an MRI of the brain and pituitary gland was performed to define the anatomy of the intracranial structures and the pituitary gland. Focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism localized to the head of the pancreas, septo-optic dysplasia and pituitary hormone deficiencies. Resection of the focal lesion from the head of the pancreas and hormonal replacement therapy for hypopituitarism.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
155	23660394	25723828	Biochemical, molecular, and clinical diagnoses of patients with cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes	Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are a group of inborn errors of creatine metabolism that involve AGAT and GAMT for creatine biosynthesis disorders and SLC6A8 for creatine transporter (CT1) deficiency. Deficiencies in the three enzymes can be distinguished by intermediate metabolite levels, and a definitive diagnosis relies on the presence of deleterious mutations in the causative genes. Mutations and unclassified variants were identified in 41 unrelated patients, and 22 of these mutations were novel. Correlation of sequencing and biochemical data reveals that using plasma guanidinoacetate (GAA) as a biomarker has 100% specificity for both AGAT and GAMT deficiencies, but AGAT deficiency has decreased sensitivity in this assay. Furthermore, the urine creatine:creatinine ratio is an effective screening test with 100% specificity in males suspected of having creatine transporter deficiency. This test has a high false-positive rate due to dietary factors or dilute urine samples and lacks sensitivity in females. We conclude that biochemical screening for plasma GAA and measuring of the urine creatine:creatinine ratio should be performed for suspected CCDS patients prior to sequencing. Also, based on the results of this study, we feel that sequencing should only be considered if a patient has abnormal biochemical results on repeat testing.

157	10432928	33608704	Germ-line TP53 mutations in Finnish cancer families exhibiting features of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome and negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2	Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for a large portion of the inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. It was recently discovered that mutations in these two genes are less common in the Finnish population than expected. Because the genetic background of breast cancer, in particular, is largely obscure, it became necessary to search for mutations in other susceptibility genes. Because seven of our BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families fulfilled the criteria of either Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL), we decided to screen them for germ-line TP53 mutations in exons 5-8 using a dual-temperature single-strand conformation polymorphism assay (SSCP). Two missense mutations (Asn235Ser and Tyr220Cys) were identified. The clinical significance of these findings was evaluated by comparison to previously reported germ-line TP53 mutation data, and by using the tumor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. In addition, an immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from mutation-positive individuals was performed. Our results suggest that the observed missense mutations confer susceptibility to cancer, and that germ-line TP53 mutations would therefore explain an additional fraction of hereditary breast cancer in Finland.

The cases included four epithelioid hemangiomas, two epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), one epithelioid angiosarcoma (EAS), four common non-epithelioid capillary hemangiomas, and four non-epithelioid angiosarcomas. Staining for FVIII-RA, UEA-1, and vimentin were observed in all cases. The EAS showed staining for keratin in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and in frozen sections. Staining for keratin was also observed in frozen sections of one EHE. Both keratin-positive vascular tumors were confirmed with electron microscopy. Carcinoembryonic antigen and epithelial membrane antigen stains were negative in all cases. Our results show that the epithelioid vascular tumors EHE and EAS, in addition to staining for the endothelial markers and vimentin, may also express the epithelial marker keratin. This is important since these tumors may closely resemble carcinomas by routine light microscopy. This study further underscores the importance of using a broad panel of immunohistochemical markers in the diagnostic workup of soft-tissue neoplasms.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
160	17728244	24564251	Stimulation of c-Myc transcriptional activity by vIRF-3 of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus	Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is associated with two lymphoproliferative disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman disease. In PEL, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is present in a latent form expressing only few viral genes. Among them is a viral homologue of cellular interferon regulatory factors, vIRF-3. To study the role of vIRF-3 in PEL lymphomagenesis, we analyzed the interaction of vIRF-3 with cellular proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, we detected the association between vIRF-3 and c-Myc suppressor, MM-1alpha. The vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha interaction was also demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous vIRF-3 and MM-1alpha in PEL-derived cell lines. Overexpression of vIRF-3 enhanced the c-Myc-dependent transcription of the gene cdk4. Addressing the molecular mechanism of the vIRF-3-mediated stimulation, we demonstrated that the association between MM-1alpha and c-Myc was inhibited by vIRF-3. Furthermore, the recruitment of vIRF-3 to the cdk4 promoter and the elevated levels of the histone H3 acetylation suggest the direct involvement of vIRF-3 in the activation of c-Myc-mediated transcription. These findings indicate that vIRF-3 can effectively stimulate c-Myc function in PEL cells and consequently contribute to de-regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation.

We report the natural history of a large multicentre cohort of such children. We reviewed case notes from three different UK centres to determine the clinical course of 34 patients (16 female, 18 male) with childhood-onset mitochondrial disease caused by SLSMDs. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival of patients presenting with haematological features (Pearson syndrome) and those with nonhaematological presentations. The most frequent initial presentation was with isolated ptosis (16/34, 47%). Eleven (32%) patients presented with transfusion-dependent anaemia soon after birth and were diagnosed with Pearson syndrome, whilst ten were classified as having Kearns-Sayre syndrome, three as having progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and seven as having PEO-plus. Three patients did not conform to any specific mitochondrial syndrome. The most frequently affected organ during the disease course was the kidney, with documented tubular or glomerular dysfunction in 17 of 20 (85%) cases who had detailed investigations. SLSMDs were present in blood and/or urine cells in all cases tested, indicating that muscle biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis in the paediatric age range. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed significantly worse mortality in patients with Pearson syndrome compared with the rest of the cohort. Mitochondrial disease caused by SLSMDs is clinically heterogeneous, and not all cases conform to a classical mitochondrial syndrome. Multisystem disease is the norm, with anaemia, renal impairment and endocrine disturbance being the most frequent extraneurological features. SLSMDs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all children presenting with ptosis.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

We investigated the characteristic pathologic findings of skin, lymph node, liver, and bone marrow to assist in proper diagnosis of AOSD.Forty AOSD patients were included in the study. The skin (26 patients), lymph node (8 patients), liver (8 patients), or bone marrow biopsies (22 patients) between 1998 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. AOSD patients were diagnosed according to the Yamaguchi criteria after excluding common infections, hematological and autoimmune diseases. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Epstein–Barr virus–encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization were performed.Most skin biopsies revealed mild lymphocytic or histiocytic infiltration in the upper dermis. Nuclear debris was frequently found in the dermis in 14 cases (53.8%). More than half of the cases (n = 14, 53.8%) showed interstitial mucin deposition. Some cases showed interface dermatitis with keratinocyte necrosis or basal vacuolization (n = 10; 38.5%). The lymph node biopsies showed a paracortical or diffuse hyperplasia pattern with immunoblastic and vascular proliferation. The liver biopsies showed sparse portal and sinusoidal inflammatory cell infiltration. All cases showed various degrees of Kupffer cell hyperplasia. The cellularity of bone marrow varied from 20% to 80%. Myeloid cell hyperplasia was found in 14 out of the 22 cases (63.6%). On immunohistochemistry, the number of CD8-positive lymphocytes was greater than that of CD4-positive lymphocytes in the skin, liver, and bone marrow, but the number of CD4-positive lymphocytes was greater than that of CD8-positive lymphocytes in the lymph nodes.The relatively specific findings with respect to the cutaneous manifestation of AOSD were mild inflammatory cell infiltration in the upper dermis, basal vacuolization, keratinocyte necrosis, presence of karyorrhexis, and mucin in the dermis. In all cases, pathologic findings in the lymph nodes included paracortical hyperplasia with vascular and immunoblastic proliferation. Skin and lymph node pathology in addition to clinical findings can aid in the diagnosis of AOSD.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

While neutrophils from normal children were incubated with the serum from the patients with SoJIA, also including incubated with FeCL3 and histone, the extracellular histone was detected, respectively; heparin was added to the above-mentioned groups to observe the changes of extracellular histone levels. The proportions of neutrophils, which released NETs, were calculated by confocal microscope.ResultsThe levels of serum histones in active SoJIA group (0.90 ± 0.90) were significantly higher than in remissive SoJIA group (0.17 ± 0.10) (P = 0.0009), and also higher than in control group (0.14 ± 0.09) (P = 0.246). Histone affects on clinical manifestations (including fever, rash, joint pain, liver and spleen enlargement, and serositis), except for joint pain. The proportions of neutrophils releasing NETs, that neutrophils were incubated with the serum from active SoJIA group, were 31.93% significantly higher than 12.32% from remissive SoJIA group (P < 0.0001). The proportions of neutrophils releasing NETs, that neutrophils were incubated with different concentration FeCl3 or with different concentration histones respectively, were positively correlated with the concentration of incubation; while heparins were added, NETs from neutrophils could be reduced effectively.ConclusionsThe level of serum histone is positively correlated with the activity of SoJIA. Serum histone may be from NETs, which were released by activated neutrophils. Free iron can activate neutrophils to produce NETs, which may release histones, and histones can further promote NETs to be released, that results in a positive feedback loop of histones, and that may be one of the pathogenesis of acute SoJIA or MAS secondary to SoJIA. Histones maybe play one of important roles in the pathogenesis of SoJIA. Heparin can act on histones to prevent histone-induced inflammation.Trial registrationChiCTR-OOC-15006228.

165	24080777	23824295	Octreotide-induced long QT syndrome in a child with congenital hyperinsulinemia and a novel missense mutation (p	Met115Val) in the ABCC8 gene. Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) denotes an inappropriate secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells in the presence of a low blood glucose level due to various genetic causes. Diazoxide is the first-line medical treatment for CHI. In case of failure, a somatostatin analogue called octreotide is used. A prolonged QT interval is an unusual side effect of octreotide which can be lethal if unrecognized. We report on a 35-day-old infant who was diagnosed with CHI on the 3rd day of his life and underwent pancreatectomy due to failure of medical treatment at 8 months. His genetic analysis revealed a compound heterozygosity for a novel missense mutation (p.Met115Val) and a nonsense mutation (p.Trp1339X) in the ABCC8 gene. Furthermore, at the 6th month of follow-up, a long QT (0.49 s) was determined by ECG examination, which was normalized following discontinuation of octreotide treatment after pancreatectomy. Thus, the long QT was considered to be secondary to octreotide medication. We recommend ECG monitoring before and during octreotide treatment in order to recognize a prolonged QT interval and to prevent related complications in cases with congenital hyperinsulinemia.

166	10487673	34715570	Suppression of insulin oversecretion by subcutaneous recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I in children with congenital hyperinsulinism due to defective beta-cell sulfonylurea receptor.	Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants under 1 yr of age. HI is most often due to defective glucose-insulin coupling by the beta-cell sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) or glutamate dehydrogenase. HI-induced hypoglycemia carries significant morbidity, and current therapies are suboptimal. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) decreases insulin secretion in vitro and in healthy adults in vivo. We postulated that recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) could benefit children with HI and hypoglycemia by decreasing insulin levels and improving fasting tolerance. We enrolled nine subjects in an open label trial of rhIGF-I: eight children, ages 1 month to 11 yr, with HI due to identified mutations of SUR1 (n = 5) or clinically unresponsive to diazoxide, which acts via the SUR (n = 3), and one adult, age 32 yr, with HI due to defective glutamate dehydrogenase-1. All had suboptimal glycemic control and served as their own controls. Subjects underwent 24-h glucose monitoring under their home regimens, followed by a supervised fasting study. The controlled fast was terminated when the subject became hypoglycemic (blood glucose, <50 mg/dL) or developed symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia. The fast was repeated 2 days later with administration of rhIGF-I at 40 microg/kg, s.c., every 12 h. At the start of fasting rhIGF-I lowered the mean serum insulin level by 70% (21.0 +/- 11.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.2 microIU/mL; P < 0.04) and lowered the mean serum C peptide level by 43% (2.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.6 ng/mL; P < 0.04). rhIGF-I suppression of insulin and C peptide persisted throughout the fast. The duration of fasting did not change significantly with rhIGF-I treatment. We have directly demonstrated that rhIGF-I inhibits insulin oversecretion in children with HI due to defective SUR1. Our data suggest that IGF inhibition of insulin secretion does not require an intact SUR. rhIGF-I is unlikely to be effective monotherapy for HI, but may provide synergy to inhibit insulin secretion when combined with agents acting via IGF-independent mechanisms.

Type 2 neurofibromatosis was found to be a risk factor for hearing loss and peripheral tumor dose was a risk factor for seventh and fifth cranial nerve injuries. These risk factors corresponded to those reported at other institutions. At the present time, controversy exists regarding history of prior surgical resection and tumor size as risk factors for cranial nerve complications. To identify more precisely the risk factors for neurological complications after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) based on long-term follow-up. Between June 1990 and September 1998, 138 patients with acoustic neurinomas had SRS at Tokyo University Hospital. Of these, the 125 patients who were followed up for at least 6 months were entered into the present study. The patients' ages ranged from 13 to 77 years (median 53 years). The average tumor diameter ranged from 6.7 to 25.4 mm (mean 13.9 mm). The maximum tumor doses ranged from 20 to 40 Gy (mean 29.8 Gy), and the peripheral doses ranged from 12 to 25 Gy (mean 15.4 Gy). One to 12 isocenters were used (median 4). The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 191 months (median 60 months). The potential risk factors for neurological complications were analyzed using two univariate actuarial analyses. The neurological complications studied included hearing loss, facial palsy, and trigeminal nerve dysfunction. The variables analyzed were age, gender, prior operation, neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), tumor diameter, maximum tumor dose, peripheral tumor irradiation dose, and the number of isocenters. Variables with significant p values (<0.05) on both actuarial analyses were considered risk factors. NF2 was significantly correlated with both total hearing loss and pure tone threshold (PTA) elevation; a history of prior surgical resection, tumor size, and the peripheral tumor dose were significantly correlated with facial palsy; and the peripheral tumor dose was significantly correlated with trigeminal neuropathy.

We present a child referred to the ENT outpatients for suspected hearing loss investigation. At one point she had grommets inserted on the basis of a flat tympanogram but with no effect. All hearing tests, including electrocochleography and distraction tests, revealed normal hearing thresholds. At the age of three years and three months, and on direct questioning of the parents, we discovered that the child responded remarkably well to music. Paediatric neurologists made the diagnosis of verbal auditory agnosia. The condition is very similar to another acquired language disorder called Landau-Kleffner syndrome. It is unusual for such a case to present primarily to an ENT surgeon.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
169	23522164	33990383	Transseptal transcatheter coil embolization of a symptomatic pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm in a patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia	An atrial transseptal approach was used for embolization of a pulmonary arteriovenous aneurysm in a 56-year-old man with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Two previous attempts at embolization of the aneurysm failed because of an inability to cannulate the feeding vessel. A transseptal puncture was performed to gain access to the left superior pulmonary vein allowing retrograde cannulation of the venous sac and successful coiling of the aneurysm without complications. Transseptal transcatheter coiling is a feasible method of treating pulmonary arteriovenous malformations if access to the feeding artery cannot be gained by a standard approach.

170	22541693	36659897	Internal cardiac defibrillator implant-associated angiosarcoma presenting as suspected implant pouch infection	Medical implants have been rarely associated with the development of sarcomas. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of a high-grade epithelioid angiosarcoma developing in the capsule of an internal cardiac defibrillator implanted subcutaneously over the abdomen over 20 years ago. Although the internal cardiac defibrillator generator had been exchanged in the intervening years, recently, the patient showed a year-long history of systemic symptoms suspicious for implant infection, necessitating several internal cardiac defibrillator pocket hematoma evacuations, always with negative microbiologic cultures. Final reexploration identified suspicious tissue with excessive bleeding which was biopsied and proven to be angiosarcoma on histologic examination. Subsequent imaging demonstrated precipitous progression to liver and lung metastases. Though rare, foreign-body-related sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis for presentations suggestive of hemorrhagic or infectious sequelae of medical implants; this case broadens the range of medical devices associated with angiosarcoma to include now very commonly used implantable medical devices.

171	17373306	32275298	Rapid idiopathic osteolysis of the humeral head and clavicle	Idiopathic osteolysis is a very rare bone condition of unknown origin. The length of the illness usually lasts for several years. The purpose of this paper is to point out the possibility of severely rapid progression of idiopathic osteolysis and to contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of Gorham-Stout disease. We report the case of a 58-year old man whose right humeral head and lateral clavicle had disappeared as a result of massive osteolysis observed only six months after onset of the symptoms. Such rapid progression has not been reported previously. His physical examination was otherwise normal. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was elevated and the other laboratory tests were normal. Radiography, computed tomography scan, bone scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation revealed extensive destruction of the right humeral head and lateral clavicle involving the acromioclavicular joint. Although the histologic features could not be confirmed because the patient refused a biopsy, it was felt that the patient satisfies the other diagnostic features of Gorham-Stout disease. Follow-up examinations revealed no further bone or soft-tissue involvement. Gorham-Stout disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of such severely rapid progression of lytic bony lesions.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
172	15943601	23618775	A common variable immunodeficient patient who developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis followed by the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome	Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary disorder characterized by impaired antibody production. CVID patients may develop recurrent infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignant lymphomas, but to our knowledge, there is no report on CVID patients who develop acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We describe a 1-yr-old female CVID patient with ADEM who evolutionally manifested the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. She was admitted with convulsions and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high-intensity areas in the right temporal lobe and the left fronto-parietal region but she became conscious soon. Her serum findings showed severe hypogammaglobulinemia and a follow up MRI revealed that these areas had diminished. Consequently, she was diagnosed as having CVID with ADEM. After 5 months, she fell to having tonic and absence seizures and we diagnosed her as having the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome from electroencephalograms (EEG) and the seizure pattern. She is now 7 yr old and her tonic seizures are controlled with valproic acid, clobazam, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy which is administrated every 2 wk. It is well known that the immune and neurologic systems have a close relationship. We suspect that a genetic defect in the immune system of our patient might also be associated with the neurologic disorders of ADEM and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

173	20584031	22149857	Novel splice-site mutations and a large intragenic deletion in PLA2G6 associated with a severe and rapidly progressive form of infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy	Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, INAD, is a severe progressive psychomotor disorder with infantile onset and characterized by the presence of axonal spheroids throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. A subset of INAD patients shows also brain iron accumulation which represents instead the distinctive feature of the idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, NBIA. These diseases share the same causative gene, PLA2G6, encoding iPLA2-VIA, a calcium-independent phospholipase. Mutations that lead to a complete absence of protein are associated with a severe INAD profile, while compound heterozygous mutations with possibly a residual protein activity are instead associated with the less severe NBIA phenotype. Here we describe two INAD patients both with an unusually rapid disease progression and a peculiar neuroradiological presentation in one of them. Compound heterozygosity for a large intragenic deletion and a nonsense mutation was found in one of them while the other is carrying two novel splice-site mutations. Breakpoint-sequence analysis suggests a non-allelic-homologous-recombination (NAHR) event, probably underlying the rearrangement. These findings, while supporting the genotype-phenotype correlation already observed in INAD patients, provide the first sequence characterization of a genomic rearrangement in PLA2G6 gene, thus orienting the search for missing mutant alleles in PLA2G6 related diseases.

174	22674575	24197886	Cdc37/Hsp90 Protein Complex Disruption Triggers an Autophagic Clearance Cascade for TDP-43 Protein	Background: In ALS, FTD, and AD, TDP-43 is cleaved and mislocalized for unknown reasons. Results: Cdc37 depletion causes TDP-43 clearance that can be blocked by tau over expression or beclin knockdown. Conclusion: Cdc37 is essential for the stability of TDP-43 and can be affected by tau accumulation. Significance: Normal TDP-43 turnover by the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex can be impaired by the emergence of tau co-pathology. The RNA-binding protein, trans-active response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), is normally found in the nucleus, but in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontal temporal dementia, and some cases of Alzheimer disease it is cleaved and mislocalized to the cytosol, leading to accumulation. The mechanisms contributing to this are largely unknown. Here, we show that part of the normal clearance cascade for TDP-43 involves the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex. An Hsp90 inhibitor that disrupts the Cdc37/Hsp90 complex reduced TDP-43 levels to a greater extent than a standard Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor. When Cdc37 was depleted, TDP-43 underwent proteolytic clearance that was dependent on nuclear retrotranslocation and autophagic uptake. Accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau prevented the clearance of cleaved TDP-43, but not its production. This caused cleaved TDP-43 to accumulate, a feature observed in the brain of persons with Alzheimer disease. Clearance of cleaved TDP-43 was also prevented by knockdown of the autophagic inducer beclin1. Thus, in cells where TDP-43 clearance is normally needed, a system that employs manipulation of the Hsp90 complex and autophagy exists. But when tau accumulation is occurring, cleaved TDP-43 can no longer be cleared, perhaps explaining the emergence of these co-pathologies.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

Clinically, HPS is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, platelet storage pool deficiency, and ceroid tissue accumulation. It is a rare disorder that has been described globally but has the highest frequency in a cluster population in Puerto Rico. HPS patients also have major organ involvement that typically includes pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Rarely have cardiomyopathy and renal dysfunction been described.

176	32480433	219169149	Human neutrophils activated by TLR8 agonists, with or without IFNγ, synthesize and release EBI3, but not IL‐12, IL‐27, IL‐35, or IL‐39	The IL‐12 family of cytokines plays crucial functions in innate and adaptive immunity. These cytokines include heterodimers sharing distinct α (IL‐12A, IL‐23A, and IL‐27A) with two β (IL‐12B and Epstein‐Barr virus induced gene 3 [EBI3]) chains, respectively, IL‐12 (IL‐12B plus IL‐12A) and IL‐23 (IL‐12B plus IL‐23A) sharing IL‐12B, IL‐27 (EBI3 plus IL‐27A), IL‐35 (EBI3 plus IL‐12A), and IL‐39 (EBI3 plus IL‐23A) sharing EBI3. In this context, we have recently reported that highly pure neutrophils incubated with TLR8 agonists produce functional IL‐23. Previously, we showed that neutrophils incubated with LPS plus IFNγ for 20 h produce IL‐12. Herein, we investigated whether highly pure, TLR8‐activated, neutrophils produce EBI3, and in turn IL‐27, IL‐35, and IL‐39, the IL‐12 members containing it. We report that neutrophils incubated with TLR8 ligands, TNFα and, to a lesser extent, LPS, produce and release remarkable amounts of EBI3, but not IL‐27A, consequently excluding the possibility for an IL‐27 production. We also report a series of unsuccessful experiments performed to investigate whether neutrophil‐derived EBI3 associates with IL‐23A to form IL‐39. Furthermore, we show that neutrophils incubated with IFNγ in combination with either TLR8 or TLR4 ligands express/produce neither IL‐12, nor IL‐35, due to the inability of IFNγ, contrary to previous findings, to activate IL12A transcription. Even IL‐27 was undetectable in supernatants harvested from IFNγ plus R848‐treated neutrophils, although they were found to accumulate IL27A transcripts. Finally, by immunohistochemistry experiments, EBI3‐positive neutrophils were found in discrete pathologies only, including diverticulitis, cholecystitis, Gorham disease, and Bartonella Henselae infection, implying a specific role of neutrophil‐derived EBI3 in vivo.

This combined treatment was administered for 8 days. Nebulized liposomal amphotericin B was well tolerated. Since severe transplant complications developed, nebulized administration was withdrawn and intravenous doses of liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin were tapered to usual schedules. Pulmonary aspergillosis responded well to 45 days of combined intravenous antifungal therapies which were maintained for 2 years with secondary prophylaxis, because of persistent immunosuppressive treatment.

The pre- and peri-natal histories of the patient were uneventful, except that he was one of monozygotic twins. He had developed normally until 24 months of life, when tonic seizures began on postvaccination day 14 without a preceding episode of continuous fever or any neurologic symptoms. The tonic seizures and atypical absence have been intractable as to various antiepileptic drugs, while his twin brother has experienced no epileptic seizures.

179	19884385	12830895	Opposite clinical phenotypes of glucokinase disease: Description of a novel activating mutation and contiguous inactivating mutations in human glucokinase (GCK) gene	Glucokinase is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cell, serving as glucose sensor in humans. Inactivating or activating mutations of glucokinase lead to different forms of glucokinase disease, i.e. GCK-monogenic diabetes of youth, permanent neonatal diabetes (inactivating mutations), and congenital hyperinsulinism, respectively. Here we present a novel glucokinase gene (GCK)-activating mutation (p.E442K) found in an infant with neonatal hypoglycemia (1.5 mmol/liter) and in two other family members suffering from recurrent hypoglycemic episodes in their childhood and adult life. In contrast to the severe clinical presentation in the index case, functional studies showed only a slight activation of the protein (relative activity index of 3.3). We also report on functional studies of two inactivating mutations of the GCK (p.E440G and p.S441W), contiguous to the activating one, that lead to monogenic diabetes of youth. Interestingly, adult family members carrying the GCK pE440G mutation show an unusually heterogeneous and progressive diabetic phenotype, a feature not typical of GCK-monogenic diabetes of youth. In summary, we identified a novel activating GCK mutation that although being associated with severe neonatal hypoglycemia is characterized by the mildest activation of the glucokinase enzyme of all previously reported.

180	32745320	225497525	Ablation of C9orf72 together with excitotoxicity induces ALS in rats	Pathogenesis of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) linked to expansion of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) hexanucleotide repeat that impairs C9orf72 expression. Loss of function of the C9orf72 protein is one of the three main proposed C9orf72‐related ALS mechanisms. However, C9orf72 loss of function, by itself, is insufficient to cause severe phenotypes in mice. Excitotoxicity is another major disease mechanism of ALS. We speculate that loss of C9orf72 protein might cause ALS in combination with excitotoxicity. To date, the effect of C9orf72 deficiency in the background of SD rat has not been examined. To test our hypothesis, we generated a line of rat with a deletion of part of the C9orf72 gene ablating the encoded protein. These animals did not develop any ALS phenotypes; however, when they were treated with kainic acid, an excitotoxicity inducer, the rats developed motor deficits and showed loss of motor neurons (MNs), Golgi complex fragmentation, and abnormal vesicle trafficking. RNA sequencing revealed profound changes in the gene profiles that were primarily associated with neural activity. Our results demonstrated that C9orf72 ablation alone was not enough to cause ALS pathogenesis in rat; but the ablation sensitized MNs to other risk factors that synergistically caused the ALS. These results support a loss of function of C9orf72 mechanism of ALS.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
181	33202772	227039799	Crystal Structure of Isoform CBd of the Basic Phospholipase A2 Subunit of Crotoxin: Description of the Structural Framework of CB for Interaction with Protein Targets	Crotoxin, from the venom of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus, is a potent heterodimeric presynaptic β-neurotoxin that exists in individual snake venom as a mixture of isoforms of a basic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) subunit (CBa2, CBb, CBc, and CBd) and acidic subunit (CA1–4). Specific natural mutations in CB isoforms are implicated in functional differences between crotoxin isoforms. The three-dimensional structure of two individual CB isoforms (CBa2, CBc), and one isoform in a crotoxin (CA2CBb) complex, have been previously reported. This study concerns CBd, which by interaction with various protein targets exhibits many physiological or pharmacological functions. It binds with high affinity to presynaptic receptors showing neurotoxicity, but also interacts with human coagulation factor Xa (hFXa), exhibiting anticoagulant effect, and acts as a positive allosteric modulator and corrector of mutated chloride channel, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), implicated in cystic fibrosis. Thus, CBd represents a novel family of agents that have potential in identifying new drug leads related to anticoagulant and anti-cystic fibrosis function. We determined here the X-ray structure of CBd and compare it with the three other natural isoforms of CB. The structural role of specific amino acid variations between CB isoforms are analyzed and the structural framework of CB for interaction with protein targets is described.

182	28551383	4333605	A exceptional collision tumor of primary adrenal angiosarcoma and non-functioning adrenocortical adenoma	Primary adrenal angiosarcoma is an extremely rare vascular tumor. We report a case of a 63-year-old man with a collision tumor of epithelioid angiosarcoma and adrenocortical adenoma of the right adrenal gland. The adrenal tumor was incidentally observed by a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of penis squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent a right laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and the tumor size measured 34×34×15mm. Histological examination revealed two different tumor cell proliferations, namely epithelioid angiosarcoma and adrenocortical adenoma. He had no symptoms or abnormality in his endocrine studies, so the adrenocortical adenoma was considered non-functioning. Three months after the adrenalectomy, bilateral pleural metastasis was observed by CT scan and pleural biopsy. Paclitaxel monotherapy was performed, and the tumor retreated. The patient died one and a half years after the adrenalectomy, but the cause of death was believed to be another disease (metastatic penis squamous cell carcinoma). To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth report of primary adrenal angiosarcoma combined with adrenocortical adenoma.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
183	12015867	24158640	HHV-8- and EBV-associated nonepidermotrophic large B-cell lymphoma presenting as a foot rash in a man with AIDS	Human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8; Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) is frequently identified in tumor tissue obtained from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), or multicentric Castleman's disease. The association between HHV-8 and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated solid lymphomas is less clear. Herein, I describe the case of a man with a CD4+ count of 30 cells/microL, and HIV viral load of 90,000 copies/mL, multi-drug resistant HIV infection, and limited stage KS. Biopsy of a progressive dorsal foot rash revealed a dense, deep, lymphoid infiltrate that extended into papillary dermis but without epidermotrophism. Microscopy showed a homogeneous population of anaplastic large B cells that stained positive for CD20 (L26), CD30, and lambda light chain. In situ hybridization of tumor tissue identified Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA, and polymerase chain reaction amplification yielded HHV-8-specific gene products. Staging studies did not reveal lymphoma elsewhere, and the patient began chemotherapy, but died from septic complications. Autopsy was notable only for the presence of a consolidative pneumonia. Although extranodal presentations are common in the setting of immunodeficiency, reports of AIDS-associated lymphoma presenting as a nonepidermotrophic foot lesion are rare. Such a presentation serves to broaden the differential of skin and foot lesions in the setting of HIV infection. More importantly, this case provides further support that HHV-8 can be associated with solid lymphomas that have an anaplastic large cell morphology.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

Here, we report the mutation profile of BRCA1/2, CHEK2 and TP53 genes in a cohort from Minas Gerais state. These genes from 44 patients at high risk for HBOC were screened through high-resolution melting and/or sequencing. The pathogenicity of the alterations was checked using ClinVar database and bioinformatics programs. In BRCA genes we identified 46 variants, 38 without clinical significance and 8 pathogenic mutations including a new pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 gene (c.4688_4694delACCTGGAinsG). The most prevalent pathogenic mutation was c.4829_4830delTG, in the BRCA2 gene. This mutation was not described in the Brazilian population up to now and in this study, it was described with a prevalence of 6.8%. The p.R337H mutation in TP53 gene was found in one patient clinically diagnosed as HBOC and without clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In CHEK2 gene, the undescribed variant c.485A > G was found and it presents as probably pathogenic through in silico analyses. Pathogenic mutations were found in 29.5% of the patients, 11.3% in BRCA1, 15.9% in BRCA2 and 2.3% in TP53 gene. Brazilian population is one of the most heterogeneous in the world and the mutational profile knowledge of genes related to HBOC from different regions can contribute to the definition of more cost-effective strategies for the prevention, identification and treatment of cancer.

185	1676608	29280364	Loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 22 DNA sequences in human meningioma	Monosomy of chromosome 22 in meningioma was the first consistent cytogenetic anomaly reported for a solid tumor. Although most meningiomas are isolated sporadic lesions, multiple and familial occurrences have been reported, usually in cases of documented neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). Previous reports have placed the NF2 locus on chromosome 22, flanked by the markers D22S1 and D22S28. We report a restriction fragment-length polymorphism study of 16 meningiomas conducted using chromosome 22 probes. None of the patients had clinical findings or a family history of NF2, although two of them eventually developed multiple intracranial meningiomas. Detectable loss of chromosome 22 sequences was observed in 50% of informative patients. Deletion mapping of tumors with preserved sequences showed that the loss of chromosome 22 DNA overlapped the region previously linked to NF2, but also included a sequence distal to the NF2 locus. These results suggest that the oncogenesis of human meningioma involves inactivation of a chromosome 22 locus that may be in close proximity to the gene for NF2.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2

The first case is a 13 year-old female presenting with pain and fever after dental treatment. The patient received antibiotic treatment for osteomyelitis, but developed progressive enlargement of the mandible and palmoplantar pustulosis. Bone scintigraphy showed intense and diffuse uptake in the mandible. The swelling decreased after indomethacin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Case 2 is a 9 year-old female patient with recurrent pain and edema of the right mandible for three years. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis was established and amoxicillin introduced. After three months, tomography showed diffuse mandible osteolysis. Indomethacin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy were introduced, however the patient presented a relapse and was treated with prednisone, rofecoxib and methotrexate. Patient 3, a 10 year-old male, had palmoplantar pustulosis and recurrent enlargement of the mandible. Tomography showed diffuse mandible osteolysis and scintigraphy revealed intense and diffuse uptake in the mandible. The patient was treated with prednisone. Rofecoxib was replaced after two relapses. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis of the mandible is often associated with prolonged pain periods and periods of activity and remission of the inflammatory process. Its recognition is important to prevent the patient from being submitted to prolonged antibiotic therapy and unnecessary invasive procedures.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0

188	15207789	31628789	Adult Still's disease reflects a Th2 rather than a Th1 cytokine profile	Adult Still's disease (ASD) is a chronic multisystemic disease. Extraordinarily high serum levels of IL-18 in ASD patients have been described, whereas the mechanism remains to be clarified. This study aimed to evaluate proinflammatory cytokines and to consider their pathological roles. In patients with rheumatic diseases (n = 151), blood samples were taken at the active phase and the serum levels of IL-18 and other proinflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. The extra-high levels of IL-18 were confirmed selectively in ASD patients (n = 10). In the active phase of ASD patients, the levels of IL-6 were elevated accordingly, but IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were undetectable. As to Th1-Th2 cytokines, the levels of IL-4 and IL-13, but not INF-gamma, IL-12, or IL-2, were elevated in all ASD patients examined. Moreover, the serum levels of IL-18 showed a good correlation with those of IL-4, suggesting that ASD reflects a Th2 rather than a Th1 cytokine profile.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
189	8756166	36745413	Slow motor conduction mainly limited to motor root in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Motor conduction velocity is expected to be normal or nearly normal in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Some studies have suggested that pathology may be present in the proximal axons. Indeed, some investigators have shown a decrease in the proximal conduction velocity in ALS by using motor conduction velocity measurements and H-reflex and F-response recordings, but they could not delineate the precise region of the conduction pathology. In this study, unlike the ones carried out previously, the most proximal segment has been studied in 11 patients with ALS, 13 normal controls, and 5 patients with sequel of poliomyelitis (SPM) by recording sensory and motor spinal root potentials. While no conduction pathology, H-reflex, or F-response abnormalities were found in ALS patients compared to normal subjects, it was shown that conduction velocity decreased in the proximal segment of the lower motor neuron of the ventral root. Despite motor neuron pathology in SPM, there was no proximal motor conduction slowing compared with that in normal subjects.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
190	12970115	11252851	Arterial endothelium-specific activin receptor-like kinase 1 expression suggests its role in arterialization and vascular remodeling	Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Two genes are linked to HHT: endoglin (ENG) in HHT1 and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1; ALK1) in HHT2. Although both genes are involved in the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathways, the pathogenetic mechanisms for HHT remain elusive. It was shown that mutations in the Alk1 gene in mice and zebrafish resulted in an embryonic lethal phenotype due to severe dilation of blood vessels. We created a novel null mutant mouse line for Alk1 (Alk1lacZ) by replacing its exons, including the one that encodes the transmembrane domain, with the beta-galactosidase gene. Using Alk1lacZ mice, we show that Alk1 is predominantly expressed in developing arterial endothelium. Alk1 expression is greatly diminished in adult arteries, but is induced in preexisting feeding arteries and newly forming arterial vessels during wound healing and tumor angiogenesis. We also show that hemodynamic changes, which require vascular remodeling, may regulate Alk1 expression. Our studies suggest the role of Alk1 signaling in arterialization and remodeling of arteries. Contrary to the current view of HHT as venous disease, our findings suggest that the arterioles rather than the venules are the primary vessels affected by the loss of an Alk1 allele, and that blood vessels with reduction in Alk1 expression may harbor defects in responding to demands for vascular remodeling.

191	28947038	33897290	Clinical impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization in patients with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia	Airway infections in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) are caused by different microorganisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The aim of this study was to investigate the association of PA colonization and the progression of lung disease in PCD. Data from 11PCD centers were retrospectively collected from 2008 to 2013. Patients were considered colonized if PA grew on at least two separate sputum cultures; otherwise, they were classified as non-colonized. These two groups were compared on the lung function computed tomography (CT) Brody score and other clinical parameters. Data were available from 217 patients; 60 (27.6%) of whom were assigned to the colonized group. Patients colonized with PA were older and were diagnosed at a later age. Baseline forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) was lower in the colonized group (72.4 ± 22.0 vs. 80.1 ± 18.9, % predicted, p = 0.015), but FEV1 declined throughout the study period was similar in both groups. The colonized group had significantly worse CT-Brody scores (36.07 ± 24.38 vs. 25.56 ± 24.2, p = 0.034). A subgroup analysis with more stringent definitions of colonization revealed similar results. Lung PA colonization in PCD is associated with more severe disease as shown by the FEV1 and CT score. However, the magnitude of decline in pulmonary function was similar in colonized and non-colonized PCD patients.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
192	19190456	23330836	Endoscopic endonasal approach for clival chordomas	Cranial base chordomas are difficult lesions to treat. The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) takes advantage of the natural sinus corridor and may provide a less invasive approach for these midline tumors. Patients undergoing EEA for chordomas were selected from a database of more than 800 consecutive patients undergoing EEA at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and were retrospectively evaluated. Additionally, a systematic review of the literature of endoscopic endonasally resected chordomas was performed and compared with our personal experience. Twenty patients (8 females and 12 males) underwent 26 endoscopic EEAs for cranial base chordomas. Eight chordomas (40%) were recurrent. Treatment of the 12 newly diagnosed chordomas included 8 total resections (66.7%), 2 near total resections (16.7%), and 2 subtotal resections (16.7%). Treatment of the 8 recurrent chordomas included 1 gross total resection (12.5%), 2 near total resections (25.0%), and 5 subtotal resections (62.5%). Two patients (10%) had recurrences, and 5 patients (25%) progressed during the mean follow-up period of 13 months (range, 1-45 months). Five patients (25%) underwent re-resection, 1 patient was lost to follow-up, and 1 patient died secondary to progression of disease. There was 1 intraoperative vascular complication with no sequelae. The cerebrospinal fluid leak rate was 25%, and there were no cases of bacterial meningitis. The incidence of a new permanent neurological complication was 5%. A systematic review of the literature yielded a total of 26 cases of chordomas resected via a completely endoscopic endonasal technique. Endoscopic endonasal resection of cranial base chordomas is safe once adequate experience is gained with the technique. This approach provides the potential for, at the least, similar resections compared with traditional cranial base approaches while potentially limiting morbidity.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3
193	27784762	7579154	DNA-fragmentation is a source of bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection is common in cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease also characterized by abundant extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the airways. The eDNA is mainly derived from neutrophils accumulating in the airways and contributes to a high sputum viscosity. The altered environment in the lower airways also paves the way for chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Here, we show that mice with P. aeruginosa airway infection have increased survival and decreased bacterial load after topical treatment with DNase. Furthermore, DNA from the sputum of CF patients showed increased bactericidal activity after treatment with DNase ex vivo. Both degraded DNA of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and genomic DNA degraded by serum, acquired bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa In vitro, small synthetic DNA-fragments (<100 base pairs) but not large fragments nor genomic DNA, were bactericidal against Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of divalent cations reduced bacterial killing, suggesting that chelation of divalent cations by DNA results in destabilization of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) envelope. This is a novel antibacterial strategy where fragmentation of eDNA and DNA-fragments can be used to treat P. aeruginosa airway infection.	Gold Standard	disease mechanism	2
194	32449234	218873157	Human herpesvirus 8-positive multicentric Castleman disease with germinotropic plasmablastic aggregates: Overlapping spectrum of human herpesvirus 8-associated lymphoproliferative disorder.	The diagnosis of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8)-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) is challenging because of the rarity and extended spectrum of each entity. A 43-year-old, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive, Japanese man was referred to our department because of persistent fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, jaundice and anasarca. Biopsy of a left axially lymph node demonstrated relatively preserved nodal structure with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) features. In the germinal center, there were aggregates of HHV8-infected plasmablasts that were diffusely positive for CD38, MUM1/IRF4, LCA, IgM and λ; partially positive for CD30, c-MYC, p53; and negative for CD138, CD20, PAX-5, κ, CD2, CD3 and CD5. A small number of Epstein-Barr virus encoded small RNA (EBER)-positive large cells infiltrated in the outer part of the germinal center and the mantle layer, but the cells copositive for EBER and HHV8 were not evident. We diagnosed the patient as HHV8-positive MCD with germinotropic plasmablastic aggregates, which demonstrated intermediate pathologic features between HHV8-positive MCD and germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder. The pathogenesis of each HHV8-associated LPD differs in cellular origin, host immune status, cytoplasmic immunoglobulin expression, clonality pattern and EBV infection; however, these factors sometimes overlap and induce extended clinical and pathologic presentations.

195	21359005	21877631	Malignant transformation of acoustic neuroma/vestibular schwannoma 10 years after gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery	Only a handful of cases of de-novo malignancies of the vestibulocochlear nerve have been reported. Even rarer is the malignant transformation of a previously histologically diagnosed benign vestibular schwannoma. We present the case of a young adult who had combined operative/Gamma knife treatment for a benign vestibular schwannoma, followed by further surgery 2 years later. He represented 10 years after original diagnosis with facial numbness and ataxia, MRI showing gross tumor recurrence. After radical resection, histology showed malignant transformation to a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Within 3 months there was rapid, aggressive recurrence with brainstem compression, requiring further surgery for brainstem decompression. Histology confirmed further de-differentiation to an anaplastic sarcoma. While awaiting radiotherapy the tumor recurred again, the patient succumbing. The patient had no features of neurofibromatosis type 2. In the literature there are 13 other cases of malignant vestibular schwannomata. Only six had radiotherapy and of these only two had histological confirmation of a benign lesion preradiotherapy. Neither of these had neurofibromatosis. Three other cases had histological proof of malignancy postradiosurgery, but with no preradiotherapy histology; of these, two were positive for neurofibromatosis. The tumor biology of vestibular schwannomata as well as the radiobiology in the context of malignant transformation is discussed.	Labeled	therapeutics in the clinic	3
196	28656169	29121712	Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis in a 9-year-old Boy	Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare aseptic, auto-inflammatory bone disorder. CRMO presents with bone pain with or without fever. The diagnosis of CRMO is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bone lesions in children. Cultures of the bone are typically sterile, antibiotic therapy does not result in clinical improvement whereas anti-inflammatory drugs improve the condition. Furthermore, biopsy should be considered in chronic and relapsing bone pain and swelling unresponsive to treatment. Herein, we present a nine-year-old boy complaining of recurrent pain in his upper and lower extremities. On examination he had mild fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. He also had experienced bone pain and weight loss in the recent month. Based on biopsy and bone scan he was finally diagnosed with CRMO. Naproxen and Pamidronate was prescribed and he was getting better and returned to normal life and activity without need to corticosteroids.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
197	9351567	20649348	Angiomyoid and follicular dendritic cell proliferative lesions in Castleman's disease of hyaline-vascular type: a study of 10 cases	Castleman's disease of hyaline-vascular type (HV CD) may rarely be associated with a confusing variety of stromal cell overgrowths and neoplasms. We report here on the pathologic and clinical findings of 10 such cases. In addition to the usual complex histoimmunophenotype of the stroma of HV CD and some unusual features that mimicked neoplasms, we observed focal proliferations of angiomyoid (five cases) and follicular dendritic cell type (five cases). The former were nonneoplastic growths featuring compact tangles of spindle cells, exhibiting immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin and interpreted as vessel-related pericytes and myoid cells. The latter were neoplastic growths of oval to spindle cells intermixed with lymphocytes; the tumor cells grew in long, intersecting bundles, featured various degree of atypia, and expressed the markers of follicular dendritic cells (CD21, CD35, KiM4p). The two types were clinically distinct. Four of five patients with angiomyoid proliferations were young women, who presented with an abdominal mass and were cured by surgery; that is, they had a clinical profile similar to that of patients with the stroma-rich variant of HV CD. The follicular dendritic cell proliferations were in older patients of either gender presenting with masses at various sites, recapitulating the profile of follicular dendritic cell tumors arising independently from HV CD; in three patients with long-term follow-up, recurrences or metastases developed at various intervals from the initial diagnosis (1 1/6, 3 1/2, and 11 years), and one patient died as a result. This study confirms the potential for, and the variety of, stromal cell proliferations in HV CD. Because their biologic behavior differs, correct identification of these various proliferative lesions is clinically important.	Labeled	clinical characteristics or disease pathology	0
198	24431198	205338319	Outpatient endoscopic sinus surgery in cystic fibrosis patients: predictive factors for admission	An increasing number of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are becoming candidates for elective endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). We sought to identify perioperative factors in this patient population that were predictive of postoperative admission. Retrospective chart review of CF patients who underwent ESS during the years 2005 through 2012. Multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative variables were analyzed. Thirty-three patients who underwent 37 outpatient ESSs were identified. Successful same-day discharge was observed in 54%. In 46% of cases, postoperative admission was necessary, with a mean postoperative stay of 1.4 days. Pulmonary function, CF-related comorbidities, and history of lung transplant were not predictors of postoperative admission. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients were more likely to be admitted if they had 1 of the following conditions: history of ≥4 prior ESS; procedure duration >2.5 hours; intraoperative blood loss greater than 150 mL; increased immediate postoperative pain scores; or larger narcotic requirements for pain control. On logistic regression analysis, a maximum pain score ≥ 7 out of 10 in the postanesthesia recovery unit was the only significant predisposing factor for postoperative admission. Although over 50% of adult CF patients can successfully undergo ESS on a same-day discharge basis, it is prudent to have contingent plans for potential inpatient observation postoperatively. Multivariate analysis suggests that preoperative demographics and pulmonary status cannot predict the need for postoperative admission, whereas higher pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit are predictive of the necessity for inpatient observation.

199	12584563	27283282	Screening for TP53 rearrangements in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome reveals a complete deletion of the TP53 gene	The absence of detectable germline TP53 mutations in a fraction of families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) has suggested the involvement of other genes, but this hypothesis remains controversial. The density of Alu repeats within the TP53 gene led us to search genomic rearrangements of TP53 in families without detectable TP53 mutation. To this aim, we adapted the quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) method to the analysis of the 11 exons of TP53. We analysed 98 families, either fulfilling (six families) or partially meeting (92 families) the criteria for LFS, and in which classical methods had failed to reveal TP53 alterations. We identified, in a large family fulfilling the criteria for LFS, a complete heterozygous deletion of TP53. Additional QMPSF analyses indicated that this deletion, which partially removed the centromeric FLJ10385 locus, covered approximately 45 kb. This deletion was shown to result from a complex rearrangement involving two distinct Alu-mediated recombinations. We conclude that TP53 germline rearrangements occur as rare events, but must be considered in LFS families without detectable point TP53 mutation.	Labeled	disease mechanism	2
