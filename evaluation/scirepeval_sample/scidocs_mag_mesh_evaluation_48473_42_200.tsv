The objective of this study is to assess and compare time trends of health related quality of life (HRQL) and chest pain in patients with coronary artery disease.Methods253 consecutive CAD patients in Stockholm County, Sweden – 197 males/56 females; 60 ± 8 years – were followed during two years. Perceived chest pain symptoms and three global assessments of HRQL were assessed at baseline, after one and after two years. EuroQol-5 dimension (EQ-5D) with a predefined focus on function and symptoms; the broader tapping global estimates of HRQL; EuroQol VAS (EQ-VAS) and Cardiac Health Profile (CHP) were used. Chest pain was ranked according to Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS). Change in HRQL was analysed by a repeated measurements ANOVA and chest pain symptoms were analysed by Friedman non-parametric ANOVA.ResultsPerceived chest pain decreased during the two years (p < 0.00022); CCS 0: 41–51%; CCS 1: 19–15%; CCS 2: 31–27%; CCS 3: 5–4% and CCS 4: 4–2%. By contrast, HRQL did not change: EQ-5D: 0.76 (CI 0.73–0.79) -0.78 (CI 0.75–0.81), EQ-VAS: 0.68 (CI 0.66–0.71)-0.68 (CI 0.65–0.71) and CHP: 0.66 (CI 0.64–0.69) -0.66 (CI 0.64–0.69).ConclusionHRQL did not increase despite a reduction in the severity of chest pain during two years. This implies that the major part of HRQL in these consecutive ordinary patients with CAD is unresponsive to change in chest pain symptoms.

The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the prophylaxis of migraine in patients refractory to other prophylactic treatments. The study included 67 migraine patients, 55 women and 12 men; 52 patients completed this prospective, open-label study. Patients were given 900-1800 mg of gabapentin in 3 doses; the mean duration of treatment was 7.2 months. Reduction in the number of days with headache, pain intensity and number of acute medications was assessed through patient diary. The mean number of migraine days/4 weeks was reduced from 15.8 to 8.6, yielding a reduction of 7.2 migraine days/4 weeks (P=0.001). Pain intensity was reduced by 25% in 14 (26.9%), by 50% in 29 (55.7%) and by 75% in three (5.7%) patients, whereas no improvement was reported by six (11.5%) patients at the end of follow up. A significant reduction was recorded in acute medication use (P=0.001). Adverse events were reported by 32/67 (47.8%) patients, in 15 (22.4%) of them causing discontinuation of the drug. The most frequently reported adverse events were drowsiness, dizziness and slowness. Prophylactic treatment with gabapentin was found to be associated with a significant reduction in the number of days with headache, use of acute medications and pain intensity.

The effect of added Al elements on the microstructure and mechanical properties of refractory high-entropy alloys were investigated. The X-ray diffraction results showed that all the high-entropy alloys consist of simple BCC solid solution. SEM indicated that the microstructure of VTaTiMoAlx changes from equiaxial dendritic-like structure to typical dendrite structure with the addition of Al element. The composition of different regions in the alloys are obtained by energy dispersive spectroscopy and shows that Ta, Mo elements are enriched in the dendrite areas, and Al, Ti, V are enriched in inter-dendrite areas. The yield strength and compress strain reach maximum (σ0.2=1221MPa, e=9.91%) at x=0, and decrease with the addition of Al element at room temperature. Vickers hardness of the alloys improves as the Al addition.	['115587635', '144031089', '118306865', '47006414', '8036948']	[]	[]	2017

Leukotrienes play a key role in the pathophysiology of chronic asthma. Activation of leukotriene pathways is accompanied by rises in detectable urinary levels of leukotriene E4 (LTE4). The relationship between urinary LTE4 levels and factors associated with acute asthma has not been determined.


METHODS
Adults aged 15-54 years presenting with moderate to severe acute asthma were evaluated at emergency departments in 16 US sites. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was measured during the first 60 minutes after arrival and at specified times until discharge or admission. Urine samples for measurement of LTE4 levels were obtained either on arrival at the study site and/or before discharge. Patients were seen 2 weeks later for follow up, at which time repeat FEV1 measurements and urine samples for LTE4 were obtained.


RESULTS
One hundred and eighty four patients were evaluated; LTE4 results from both the acute and follow up periods were available for analysis in 146. Urinary LTE4 levels were increased during asthma exacerbations compared with levels obtained 2 weeks later (geometric means 111.7 and 75.6 pg/mg creatinine, respectively, mean percentage change -32.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean percentage change -39.6 to -24.3, p<0.001). The correlation between improvement in FEV1 and decline in LTE4 over the 2 week interval was significant (p<0.001, r=0.43).


CONCLUSIONS
Activation of leukotriene pathways in acute asthma is correlated with the degree of airflow obstruction, and resolution of the asthma exacerbation is associated with a reduction in leukotriene levels."

This research was intended to provide information about two core components of withdrawal (negative affect and craving): (1) how various withdrawal symptom profile dimensions (e.g., mean level, volatility, extreme values) differ between negative affect and craving; and (2) how these dimensions relate to cessation outcome. Adult smokers (N = 1,504) in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled smoking cessation trial provided real-time withdrawal symptom data four times per day for 4 weeks (2 weeks pre-quit and 2 weeks post-quit) via palmtop computers. Cessation outcome was biochemically confirmed 8-week point-prevalence abstinence. Examination of craving and negative affect dimensions following a cessation attempt revealed that craving symptoms differed from negative affect symptoms, with higher means, greater variability, and a greater incidence of extreme peaks. Regression analyses revealed that abstinence was associated with lower mean levels of both craving and negative affect and fewer incidences of extreme craving peaks. In a multivariate model, the increase in mean craving and negative affect scores each uniquely predicted relapse. Real-time reports revealed different patterns of abstinence-related negative affect and craving and that dimensions of both predict cessation outcome, suggesting that negative affect and craving dimensions each has motivational significance. This underscores the complexity of withdrawal as a determinant of relapse and the need to measure its distinct components and dimensions.

We find that the model in three dimensions is indeed unitary in the tree-level, but the corresponding model in higher dimensions is not so due to the appearance of non-unitary massless spin-2 modes.

Since its description in 1980, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has been a widely used method for insertion of a gastrostomy tube in patients who are unable to swallow or maintain adequate nutrition. This study aimed to assess the perspectives of patients/caregivers in our society regarding the acceptability of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement and to evaluate the outcomes.


METHODS
One hundred consecutive adults referred to our unit to be considered for primary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding at Imam Reza Hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences were evaluated prospectively from October 2007 to June 2009. The nutritional status of patients, complications and quality of life were assessed after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion for six months. The data were analyzed using SPSS software.


RESULTS
Indications for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy were neurologic in 66 patients and recurrent pulmonary aspiration in 14 intensive care unit adult patients. Minor complications included percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site infection in 8 patients and tube blockage in 5 patients. Oral feeding was resumed in 27% of the patients and the tube was removed subsequently after 3-6 months; 42 patients died due to primary diseases (in 1-6 months). The Quality of Life Index scores pre-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement and 6 months after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy averaged 19.25±11.85 and 30.08±27.74, respectively. A similarly significant difference was also found between mean Quality of Life Index scores pre- and post-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement (p<0.005).


CONCLUSIONS
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is a minimally invasive gastrostomy method with low morbidity and mortality rates, and is easy to follow-up and to replace when blockage occurs."

As part of the online survey we conducted a randomized assessment of two versions of the adherence questionnaire—one which asked about adherence to a specific antiretroviral medication, and a second which asked about adherence to their “HIV medicines” as a group. Participants were better able to respond using adjectival and adverbial scales than visual analogue or percent items. The internal consistency reliability of the three item adherence scale was 0.89. Mean scores for the two different versions of the online survey were similar (91.0 vs. 90.2, p < 0.05), suggesting that it is not necessary, in general, to ask about individual medications in an antiretroviral therapy regimen when attempting to describe overall adherence.

A previous study suggested that the long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist salmeterol (SM) had inhibitory effects on bronchial mucosal inflammation 6 hours after allergen exposure. To further evaluate the influence of SM on allergen-induced airway inflammation. We studied, in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, 16 mild asthmatic patients who had a dual asthmatic response to allergen inhalation. Subjects received 50 microg of SM or placebo (P), twice daily for 1 week each, separated by a 2-week wash-out period. At the end of each treatment period, after withholding SM for 24 h, they had a methacholine inhalation test (medication was resumed after the test), followed 24 h later by an AC with the concentration of allergen that had induced a LAR at baseline. Airway inflammation was assessed 24 h after the AC by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (n = 16) and bronchial biopsies (n = 13). As expected, SM improved baseline FEV1 and PC20 (P < or = 0.009) and decreased the allergen-induced early bronchoconstrictive response. There were no significant differences in BAL cell counts after the two treatments. On bronchial biopsies, numbers (median, mm2) of submucosal CD45 (P: 43 +/- 23; SM: 161 +/- 43, P = 0.031), CD45Ro (P: 37 +/- 19; SM: 126 +/- 41, P = 0.047) and AA1 positive cells (P: 38 +/- 6, SM: 65 +/- 17, P = 0.006) were significantly higher after SM than P treatment. The numbers of CD4 (P: 11 +/- 10; SM: 32 +/- 7, P = 0.085), HLA-DR (P: 65 +/- 30; SM: 116 +/- 36, P = 0.079) and EG2 positive cells (P: 25 +/- 15; SM: 38 +/- 26, P = 0.09) tended to increase with SM treatment. In summary, compared to placebo, 1 week of regular use of SM is associated with an increase in bronchial inflammatory cells 24 h after AC. This is in keeping with the recommendation that salmeterol should only be used with an anti-inflammatory agent, particularly in the context of significant allergen exposure.

The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) has suggested to asses pain after specific activities consistently in clinical trials on knee OA. The Dynamic weight-bearing Assessment of Pain (DAP) assesses pain during activity (30 s of performing repeated deep knee-bends from a standing position). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the construct validity, responsiveness, and interpretability of the DAP for knee osteoarthritis (OA).


METHODS
One-hundred participants with knee OA were tested twice each with the DAP, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), six-minute-walk-test (6MWT), and 6-min-walk-test with subsequent pain rating (6MWTpain), and once with a transition questionnaire (TRANS-Q) for the patient-reported change in pain after 12 weeks of exercise. Construct validity (baseline-scores) and responsiveness (change-scores) were estimated by Spearman Correlation Coefficients. We hypothesized that no correlations would be excellent (<0.7) (divergent validity), except for the 6MWTpain (convergent validity). The TRANS-Q was used for interpreting the DAP change-scores in terms of responsiveness and Minimal Important Change (MIC).


RESULTS
Divergent validity with the KOOS subscales (r = -0.31 to-0.45) and the 6MWT (r = -0.25) was supported. Convergent validity with the 6MWTpain was not supported (r = 0.54). The DAP change-scores corresponded to patient-reported change in pain (TRANS-Q), while correlations with change-scores on the other instruments were <0.35. The MIC was 2.4 DAP points.


CONCLUSIONS
The DAP possesses divergent validity compared to other instruments for knee OA, supporting the potential for this new way of assessing pain directly during activity. Importantly, the DAP change-scores correspond to patient-reported changes in pain, showing responsiveness. A change of 2.4 or more can be interpreted as clinically relevant. The DAP is a promising alternative to using 'pain on walking' as a clinical trial inclusion criterion/outcome."

The quality of hospital care for stroke varies, particularly in rural areas. In 2007, funding to improve stroke care became available as part of the Rural Stroke Project (RSP) in New South Wales (Australia). The RSP included the employment of clinical coordinators to establish stroke units or pathways and protocols, and more clinical staff. We aimed to describe the effectiveness of RSP in improving stroke care and patient outcomes.


METHODS
A historical control cohort design was used. Clinical practice and outcomes at 8 hospitals were compared using 2 medical record reviews of 100 consecutive ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage patients ≥12 months before RSP and 3 to 6 months after RSP was implemented. Descriptive statistics and multivariable analyses of patient outcomes are presented.


RESULTS



SAMPLE
pre-RSP n=750; mean age 74 (SD, 13) years; women 50% and post-RSP n=730; mean age 74 (SD, 13) years; women 46%. Many improvements in stroke care were found after RSP: access to stroke units (pre 0%; post 58%, P<0.001); use of aspirin within 24 hours of ischemic stroke (pre 59%; post 71%, P<0.001); use of care plans (pre 15%; post 63%, P<0.001); and allied health assessments within 48 hours (pre 65%; post 82% P<0.001). After implementation of the RSP, patients directly admitted to an RSP hospital were 89% more likely to be discharged home (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.66).


CONCLUSIONS
Investment in clinical coordinators who implemented organizational change, together with increased clinician resources, effectively improved stroke care in rural hospitals, resulting in more patients being discharged home."

We reasoned that heliox breathing (79% helium–21% oxygen) and the attendant reduction of operating lung volumes should accelerate HR kinetics in the transition from rest to high-intensity exercise. Eleven male ambulatory patients with clinically stable COPD undertook constant work-rate cycle testing at 80% of each individuals’ maximum work capacity while breathing room air (RA) or heliox (HX), randomly. Mean response time (MRT) for HR and dynamic end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) were measured. Resting EELV was not affected by HX breathing, while exercise EELV decreased significantly by 0.23 L at isotime during HX breathing compared with RA. During HX breathing, MRT for HR significantly accelerated (p = 0.002) by an average of 20 s (i.e., 17%). Speeded MRT for HR correlated with indices of reduced lung hyperinflation, such as EELV at isotime (r = 0.88, p = 0.03), and with improved exercise endurance time (r = −0.64, p = 0.03). The results confirm that HX-induced reduction of dynamic lung hyperinflation is associated with consistent improvement in indices of cardio-circulatory function such as HR kinetics in the rest-to-exercise transition in COPD patients.

Treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is evolving from interferon (IFN)-based therapy to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, yet some safety concerns have arisen involving cardiac toxicity. In this study, we sought to better understand the potential off-target toxicities of new DAAs. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and pathological findings of the sentinel case in a phase II study that led to clinical development discontinuation for BMS-986094, an HCV nucleotide polymerase (nonstructural 5B) inhibitor. We also report on outcomes from other patients in the same study, including electrocardiogram changes, cardiovascular biomarkers, and transthoracic echocardiograms. Thirty-four patients received IFN-free BMS-986094 regimens. Six patients had left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) <30%, 8 had LVEFs 30%-50%, and 11 required hospitalization for suspected cardiotoxicity. Of the patients with LVEF <50%, 6 had normalization of systolic function after a median of 20 days. T-wave inversions were the most sensitive predictor of LVEF dysfunction. B-type natriuretic peptide levels increased over time and correlated with the degree of LVEF dysfunction. Pathological analysis of cardiac tissue revealed severe myocyte damage with elongated myofibrils without gross necrosis. These findings were consistent with some results of recent primate studies that were conducted to further investigate the potential mechanisms of BMS-986094 toxicity.


CONCLUSION
A novel nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor developed for HCV treatment may cause a toxic cardiomyopathy. Ongoing surveillance of DAAs for cardiotoxicities may be beneficial, especially among patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease."

To establish the efficacy in terms of morbidity and quality of life of a group education program on asthma aimed at children and caregivers.


METHODS
An open, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken in 13 primary health care centers in Spain, Cuba, and Uruguay and involved 245 children with active asthma aged 9 to 13 years and their caregivers. The intervention consisted of 3 educational sessions lasting 45 to 60 minutes each and was performed with 3 intervention groups: children alone, caregivers alone, and both children and caregivers. The outcome measures were difference between intervention and control groups in the rate of asthma attacks and hospital admission, as well as the quality of life of children and caregivers in the 6 months following the intervention.


RESULTS
The rate of asthma attacks per patient-year decreased when the intervention was given only to children (mean difference, -1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.87 to -0.34) or to both children and caregivers (-1.60; 95% CI, -2.88 to -0.31). Hospital admissions per patient-year decreased in the intervention groups children alone (-0.28; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.05) and both children and caregivers (-0.25; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.02). Education provided to caregivers alone was not associated with any changes in morbidity. No differences were observed in terms of quality of life between controls and any of the intervention groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Group education on asthma reduces morbidity but does not improve quality of life. The benefits are apparent when education is aimed at children but no additional benefit is obtained if the intervention is also aimed at their caregivers. Finally, group education for adult caregivers alone is not effective."

Prolonged esophageal pH measurements can be obtained in hospitalized patients with a stationary technique and in ambulant outpatients by means of a portable device; however, there have been no studies that have examined whether the two approaches provide a similar diagnostic accuracy. We performed a prospective study to compare stationary and ambulatory pH-metry in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Seventy-seven control subjects and 178 patients with proven gastroesophageal reflux disease were randomized to either ambulant or static pH-metry, which was performed with standard pH electrodes, sensors, and recorders. Reflux events (intraesophageal pH<4.0) analyzed were: number of episodes; total, upright, and supine reflux time; number of episodes lasting >5 min; and duration of the longest episode. A composite score of all reflux events according to DeMeester was also calculated. The limits of normality were defined as the 95th percentiles of the control groups. Both controls and patients assigned to either pH monitoring method were comparable. Of 255 studies attempted, 243 (95%) were completed successfully. The results showed similar median values of reflux events for the two control groups and for the two patients groups. Percent total reflux time provided a good separation between normal and abnormal reflux, with a sensitivity of 0.92 for static pH-metry and 0.68 for the ambulant procedure (respective 95th percentiles, 3.4 and 4.6). The lower sensitivity of ambulatory pH-metry compared to the stationary method could not be attributed to the higher normal limit in the former; circumstantial evidence suggests that dietary restrictions by the patients to minimize symptoms during home monitoring were probably responsible of this relatively high false negative rate. In conclusion, the results confirm the accuracy of stationary pH monitoring in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux and show that the ambulatory procedure is less reliable; its sensitivity could probably be improved by strict dietary standardization.

Long-term exercise interventions have been shown to improve vital capacity in cystic fibrosis (CF). Yet, no data are available indicating positive effects of long-term exercise training on FEV1.


METHODS
39 Swiss patients with CF were randomly divided into strength training (ST, n=12), endurance training (AT, n=17) and controls (CON(CH), n=10), and also compared with age-matched Swiss (n=35) and German (n=701) CF registry data. A partially supervised training of 3×30 min/week for 6 months took place with measurements at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Primary outcome was FEV1 at 6 months.


RESULTS
FEV1 increased significantly in both training groups compared with CON(CH) (AT:+5.8±0.95, ST:+7.4±2.5, CON(CH):-11.5±2.7% predicted, p<0.001) and both registry groups at 6 months. At 24 months, changes in favour of the training groups persisted marginally compared with CONCH, but not compared with registry data.


CONCLUSIONS
A partially supervised training over 6 months improved FEV1 but effects were basically gone 18 months off training. Regular long-term training should be promoted as essential part of treatment in CF."

This study explores the potential role of a novel interferon-containing regimen for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and underlying haemophilia.


METHODS
This trial (NCT01741545) was an open-label, non-randomized phase 3 study, which included adult haemophiliacs with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with HCV genotypes (GT)-2 or -3 were treated with Lambda-IFN/ribavirin (RBV)/daclatasvir (DCV) for 12 weeks (cohort A). Patients with HCV GT-1b or -4 were treated with Lambda-IFN/RBV/DCV for 12 weeks, followed by Lambda-IFN/RBV for an additional 12 weeks (cohort B). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a sustained virologic response at post-treatment follow-up week 12 (SVR12). Clinical development of Lambda-IFN was discontinued during this trial leading to study termination before a 24-week post-treatment follow-up was obtained for all participants.


RESULTS
Overall, 51 patients were treated (cohort A, n = 12; cohort B, n = 39). The proportion of patients achieving SVR12 was 92% in cohort A and 90% in cohort B. Therapy was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events (AEs) were related to elevations in serum transaminases and/or bilirubin. Five serious AEs, four discontinuations due to AEs, and no deaths were reported. The rate of grade 3-4 bilirubin elevations was 17-18% across cohorts.


CONCLUSION
Lambda-IFN/RBV/DCV treatment demonstrated a high SVR rate and was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with expectations for this special patient population. This study supports use of DCV as part of a combination treatment regimen for haemophiliacs with CHC."

There are some animal studies suggesting the possible role of vitamin C for treating depression. However, the efficacy of vitamin C for treating adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has never been examined.


METHODS
This 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial included adult patients with major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Twenty-one patients in the treatment group received citalopram plus vitamin C and the 22 patients in the control group received citalopram plus placebo. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms at baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8. We also checked for the presence of adverse effects.


RESULTS
While depression symptoms decreased in both groups during this trial, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .5). The rate of remission, partial response, and complete response was not different between the two groups. The rate of adverse effects were not different between the two groups.


CONCLUSION
Adding vitamin C to citalopram did not increase the efficacy of citalopram in MDD patients. Vitamin C plus citalopram is as effective as placebo plus citalopram for treating adult patients with suicidal behavior. No serious adverse effect for this combination was identified during this trial.

Low serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites are widespread in elderly people in the UK, especially in those with low-trauma fractures. Vitamin D and calcium, alone or in combination, are often recommended for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. Inadequate vitamin D status, exacerbated by low calcium intake, might raise the risk of these fractures by increasing bone resorption and loss from secondary hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D might also protect against falls that lead to fracture. Evidence from randomised trials favours the combination of calcium and vitamin D. In this secondary-prevention study we aimed to test whether calcium and vitamin D, alone or in combination compared with placebo, would lead to one less person per 100 having a fracture every year over a median of 3 years. Methods Participants 15 024 people age 70 years or older who had had a lowtrauma, osteoporotic fracture in the previous 10 years were assessed between Feb 1, 1999, and March 31, 2002. The trial was based in 21 hospitals in the UK. Ethics approval was obtained from the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland and from the local research ethics committee of each hospital, and participants gave written informed consent. Study nurses identified potential participants from hospital notes of patients seen in a fracture clinic or orthopaedic ward; patients were also recruited by telephone. Reasons for exclusion were: bed or chair bound before fracture; cognitive impairment indicated by an abbreviated mental test score of less than seven; cancer in the past 10 years that was likely to metastasise to bone; fracture associated with pre-existing local bone abnormality; those known to have hypercalcaemia; renal stone in the past 10 years; life expectancy of less than Published online April 28, 2005 DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(05) 63013-9	['1902717']	[]	['32a6ad180f234265d93b2ffc8e14cdde0d0f0bfc', '646a332d5071831e96aa6bdfb4d72079cadd31fc', '6b6183863843e34149f9c36353ddb40d093a9a9e', '5793007797d917b0c7913d5ecd2efa6b960a5121', 'f9fde8d9a4c0ffc2817b30fcdc93ad8201b0bd63', 'c07905418164124ea8cc7f21c00a1a36bf6e717c', '08d4fb05b03a4b7236949f46ad49e1b5ec2cc04a', 'f8ac6924c9a0c5f079121a17f75afd95989afd43', '622af19fdbf28e60dfbd9ce5afb917dfab188a09', 'dfe131ac7b17f12dbc5248644d0c531520466518']	2005

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a late cystic fibrosis (CF)-associated comorbidity whose prevalence is increasing sharply lifelong. Guidelines for glucose metabolism (GM) monitoring rely on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, this test is neither sensitive nor specific. The aim of this study was to compare sensitivity and specificity of different methods for GM monitoring in children and adolescents with CF.


METHODS
Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS), used as the reference method, was compared with the OGTT, intravenous glucose tolerance test (IGTT), homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment index of β-cell function (HOMA-%B) and glycated haemoglobin A1C. Patients were classified into three groups according to CGMS: normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus (DM).


RESULTS
Twenty-nine patients (median age: 13.1 years) were recruited. According to CGMS, 11 had DM, 12 IGT and six NGT, whereas OGTT identified three patients with DM and five with IGT. While 13 of 27 had insulin deficiency according to IGTT, there was 19 of 28 according to HOMA-%B. According to HOMA-IR, 12 of 28 had insulin resistance. HOMA-%B was the most sensitive method for CFRD screening [sensitivity 91% (95% CI), specificity 47% (95% CI) and negative predictive value 89% (95% CI)].


CONCLUSIONS
OGTT showed the weak capacity to diagnose DM in CF and should no longer be considered as the reference method for CFRD screening in patients with CF. In our study, HOMA-%B showed promising metrics for CFRD screening. Finally, CGMS revealed that pathological glucose excursions were frequent even early in life."

This article discusses the main financial practices used by artisanal fisheries, using as its main reference the case of the Santa Catarina coast. The analysis of the informal financial networks established in the vacuum left by public policies is based on the precepts of economic sociology and new institutional economics. The empiric reflection uses data collected at meetings and in interviews with fishermen, organizations and public administrators linked to the sector, fish buyers and financial and extension agents. Based on the understanding of the main institutional arrangements and the conduct of the artisanal fisheries and final agents on the Santa Catarina coast, the study indicates the low quality of financial services provided to this social category when compared with family farmers. The main justification for this comparison is the fact that artisanal fisheries are offered the same credit policies as those made available to family farmers. Thus, fishermen turn to informal financing schemes, reproducing a common strategy in other low income segments of the Brazilian population. Finally, the study analyzes a recent incentive to organize artisanal fishermen in rural credit cooperatives of a “solidarity” nature. It argues that innovative forms of governance of these experiences contribute to the democratization of rural credit and the strengthening of territorial development dynamics. Key words: solidarity cooperativism, artisanal fishing, sustainable territorial development, government credit policies.

Mature T cells express either CD8 or CD4, defining two physiologically distinct populations of T cells. CD8+ T cells, or killer T-cells, and CD4+ T cells, or helper T cells, effect different aspects of T cell mediated adaptive immunity. Currently, determining the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells requires flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. The genomic T cell receptor locus is rearranged during T cell maturation, generating a highly variable T cell receptor locus in each mature T cell. As part of thymic maturation, T cells that will become CD4+ versus CD8+ are subjected to different selective pressures. In this study, we apply high-throughput next-generation sequencing to T cells from both a healthy cohort and a cohort with an autoimmune disease (multiple sclerosis) to identify sequence features in the variable CDR3 region of the rearranged T cell receptor gene that distinguish CD4+ from CD8+ T cells. We identify sequence features that differ between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including Variable gene usage and CDR3 region length. We implement a likelihood model to estimate relative proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using these features. Our model accurately estimates the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell sequences in samples from healthy and diseased immune systems, and simulations indicate that it can be applied to as few as 1000 T cell receptor sequences; we validate this model using in vitro mixtures of T cell sequences, and by comparing the results of our method to flow cytometry using peripheral blood samples. We believe our computational method for determining the CD4:CD8 ratio in T cell samples from sequence data will provide additional useful information for any samples on which high-throughput TCR sequencing is performed, potentially including some solid tumors.

A pilot study	Purpose To determine whether macular photocoagulation has any effect on refraction in diabetics.Methods This was a prospective study of 12 eyes of 12 diabetics with refraction at 2 weeks before and at 4 weeks and 4 months after argon laser. This was combined with a questionnaire survey of attitude among ophthalmologists on prescribing spectacles for diabetics awaiting macular laser. The main outcome measure was the spherical equivalents (SEQ) before and after treatment.Results Only 36% of ophthalmologists surveyed would prescribe corrective lenses in patients waiting for macular photocoagulation. The median change in magnitude of SEQ at 4-6 weeks post-laser compared to pre-laser was 0.36 D (interquartile range 0.18-0.50 D). The median change in SEQ at 4 months was 0.25 D (interquartile range 0.12-0.56 D). These changes in SEQ from pre-treatment values were not statistically significant on Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p = 0.17 and 0.10, respectively). The correlation coefficient between difference and average SEQ was 0.02 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.19, p = 0.75) at 4 weeks and 0.11 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.275, p = 0.17) at 4 months, indicating no tendency for change in refraction with increasing ametropia.Conclusion This pilot study implies that argon laser photocoagulation in diabetic maculopathy does not alter refraction. Prescription of corrective lenses can be performed prior to laser therapy, if required.

Both metoprolol and carvedilol produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with chronic heart failure; carvedilol exerts greater antiadrenergic effects than metoprolol, but it is unknown whether this pharmacological difference results in hemodynamic and clinical differences between the 2 drugs.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We randomized 150 patients with heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction </=0.35) to double-blind treatment with either metoprolol or carvedilol. When compared with metoprolol (124+/-55 mg/d), patients treated with carvedilol (49+/-18 mg/d) showed larger increases in left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (+10.9+/-11.0 versus +7.2+/-7.7 U, P=0.038) and in left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work during exercise (both P<0. 05) after 13 to 15 months of treatment. In addition, carvedilol produced greater decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during exercise, than metoprolol (all P<0.05). In contrast, the metoprolol group showed greater increases in maximal exercise capacity than the carvedilol group (P=0.035), but the 2 drugs improved symptoms, submaximal exercise tolerance, and quality of life to a similar degree. After a mean of 23+/-11 months of follow-up, 21 patients in the metoprolol group and 17 patients in the carvedilol group died or underwent urgent transplantation.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study demonstrates that during long-term therapy, carvedilol improves cardiac performance to a greater extent than metoprolol when administered to patients with heart failure in the doses shown to be effective in clinical trials. These differences were likely related to a greater antiadrenergic activity of carvedilol."	['4955663', '50462932', '5592889', '5566840', '4571041', '5716833']	[]	[]	2000

We investigated the ability of prototypical inflammatory cytokines to predict clinical outcomes in a large population of patients with chronic systolic heart failure (HF).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), soluble TNF receptors type I and II (sTNF-RI and sTNF-RII), and the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were analysed in 1464 patients with chronic ischaemic systolic HF in the CORONA study, aged ≥ 60 years, in NYHA class II-IV, and related to the primary endpoint (n = 320), as well as any coronary event (n = 255), all-cause mortality (n = 329), cardiovascular (CV) mortality (n = 268), and the composite endpoint hospitalization from worsening heart failure (WHF) or CV mortality (n = 547). TNF-α, sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, and IL-8, but not MCP-1, were independent predictors of all endpoints except the coronary endpoint in multivariable models including conventional clinical variables. After further adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate, the ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio, NT-proBNP, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, only IL-8 remained a significant predictor of all endpoints (except the coronary endpoint), while sTNF- RI remained independently associated with CV mortality. Adding IL-8 to the full model led to a significant improvement in net reclassification for all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, but only a borderline significant improvement for the primary endpoint, CV mortality, and the composite endpoint WHF hospitalization or CV mortality.


CONCLUSION
Our study supports a relationship between IL-8 and outcomes in patients with chronic HF. However, the clinical usefulness of IL-8 as a biomarker in an unselected HF population is at present unclear."

While the origins of the notion trace back to the 19th century, in-depth theoretical investigations and widespread real-life applications are relatively recent and concern an interdisciplinary field connecting management accounting, corporate finance and financial mathematics (Peasnell, 1981, 1982; Peccati, 1987, 1989, 1991; Stewart, 1991; Ohlson, 1995; Arnold and Davies, 2000; Young and O'Byrne, 2001; Martin, Petty and Rich, 2003). This paper presents both a historical outline of its birth and development and an overview of the main recent contributions regarding capital budgeting decisions, production and sales decisions, implementation of optimal portfolios, forecasts of asset prices and calculation of intrinsic values. A most recent theory, the systemic-value-added approach (also named lost-capital paradigm), provides a different definition of residual income, consistent with arbitrage theory. Enfolded in Keynes's (1936) notion of user cost and forerun by Pressacco and Stucchi (1997), the theory has been formally introduced in Magni (2000a,b,c; 2001a,b; 2003), where its properties are thoroughly investigated as well as its relations with the standard theory; two different lost-capital metrics have been considered, for value-based management purposes, by Drukarczyk and Schueler (2000) and Young and O'Byrne (2001). This work illustrates the main properties of the two theories and their relations, and provides a minimal guide to construction of performance metrics in the two approaches.

At baseline, there were negative correlations between the ESR and serum testosterone (r = -0.42, P < 0.01) and BMD (hip, r = -0.65, P < 0.01). A total of 29.6% of all patients had at least one vertebral fracture, most having multiple fractures. Back pain, however, was not more prevalent in fracture patients (55% vs 50%). Disease activity was significantly higher in the fracture group (joint score P < 0.05, rheumatoid factor P < 0.01). Thirty patients completed the trial, 15 receiving testosterone and 15 receiving placebo. There were significant rises in serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and oestradiol in the treatment group. There was no significant effect of treatment on disease activity overall, five patients receiving testosterone underwent a ""flare'. Differences in mean BMD following testosterone or placebo were non-significant (spine: +1.2% vs -1.1%; femur: -0.3% vs +0.3%). There was no suggestion of a positive effect of testosterone on disease activity in men with RA."

Pulmonary hypertension is a contradiction for heart transplantation (HTx). The aim of the study was to examine prognostic significance of pulmonary hemodynamic variables in patients with severe chronic heart failure (HF) considered for HTx.


METHODS
Patients with HF were qualified to HTx in Poland. We measured pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), transpulmonary gradient (TPG), cardiac output (CO), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). We performed biochemical evaluation, 6-min walking test, VO2max. Death or emergency HTx were assumed as the endpoints in the follow-up. Death or any kind of HTx were considered an end of observation. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves (long rank test with strait defined by terciles of analyzed hemodynamic parameters).


RESULTS
Six hundred and fifty-eight patients were qualified to HTx between 2003 and 2007. The mean follow-up: 601 days. 87.8% male. Mean age was under 50, III and IV NYHA class. Mean PASP was 44.3 ± 16.9 mm Hg, TPG 10.0 ± 6.6 mm Hg and PVR 2.9 mm Hg, PCWP20.9 ± 9.3 mm Hg. PASP and PCWP had influence on survival or emergency HTx. There was a significant difference in survival between patients with PCWP > 25 mm Hg and PCWP < 25 mm Hg. The worst prognosis was with PASP higher than 50 mm Hg. One-, two-, and three-year survival was 75%, 58% and 48% compared to patients with PASP < 35 mm Hg (80%, 70%, and 68%, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
In patients qualified to HTx, pathological values of pulmonary hemodynamic parameters have a significant influence on survival. The worst prognosis have patients with PASP > 50 mm Hg, and PCWP > 25 mm Hg. Pulmonary hemodynamic parameters are important during allocation process to HTx."

"Those responsible for utility operations can only manage what they measure, so having information on productivity trends and relative performance enables utility managers to direct attention to shortfalls. Similarly, policy-makers require quantitative analyses in order to identify utilities with strong and weak performance. Examples from Central America are used to illustrate key points. A recent IADB study reports that investments of $40 billion for water assets are needed to meet the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals; wastewater treatment would significantly raise that funding requirement (""Obstacles and Constraints, 2003). A survey of 400 stakeholders included in the study identified inappropriate pricing policy and lack of clarity in regulatory processes as the two major constraints for increasing investment in water and sanitation systems (WSS) in Latin America and the Caribbean. Private sector funding could play a role in expanding or improving urban water systems through either equity investments or the purchase of municipal bonds. However, external financial flows are required to increase significantly absent major improvements in system performance and to develop incentives for better WSS performance - in the sense of increased quality of service provision and cost efficiency of the utility system's operations. Expecting infrastructure investment to grow in Central America, the Inter- American Development Bank (IADB) funded a PURC study on Benchmarking Water Utilities in the region. The aim of IADB was to gauge the impact of loans on network expansion (coverage) and on service quality. In addition, water professionals at international organizations must be able to understand what utilities (and nations) are doing as ""best practice"" so that incentives can be developed to enhance performance (Baietti, et. al., 2006). The project involved conducting metric benchmarking analysis using data gathered from national regulators and utilities. This work complements and extends the Association of Water Regulators of the Americas' (ADERASA) recent empirical study on benchmarking Latin American water service providers."

To present an interim analysis of the trial comparing two neoadjuvant therapies for unresectable rectal cancer.


METHODS
Patients with fixed cT3 or cT4 or locally recurrent rectal cancer without distant metastases were randomized to either 5 × 5 Gy and 3 courses of FOLFOX4 (schedule I) or 50.4 Gy delivered in 28 fractions given simultaneously with 5-Fu, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (schedule II). Surgery in both groups was performed 12 weeks after the beginning of radiation and 6 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment.


RESULTS
49 patients were treated according to schedule I and 48 according to schedule II. Grade III+ acute toxicity was observed in 26% of patients in group I and in 25% in group II. There were two toxic deaths, both in group II. The microscopically radical resection (primary endpoint) rate was 73% in group I and 71% in group II. Overall and severe postoperative complications were recorded in 27% and 9% of patients vs. 16% and 7%, respectively. Pathological complete response was observed in 21% of the patients in group I and in 9% in group II.

We report a multicenter retrospective study of 84 consecutive adult patients with AO and AOA treated with RT plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) between February 2004 and January 2011. Correlations between chromosome 1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase1 (IDH1) mutation, and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation with survival outcomes have been analyzed. For all 84 patients the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival rates were 55.6 and 45.2 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity occurred in 17 % of patients. Chromosome 1p/19q codeletion was detected in 57 %, IDH1 mutation in 63 %, and MGMT promoter methylation in 74 % of evaluable patients. In multivariate analysis the presence of chromosome 1p/19q codeletion was associated with significant survival benefit (median OS 34 months in noncodeleted tumors and not reached in codeleted tumors; HR 0.16, 95 % CI 0.03–0.45; P = 0.005). IDH1 mutation was also of prognostic significance for longer survival (P = 0.001; HR 0.20, 95 % 0.06–0.41), whereas MGMT promoter methylation was only of borderline significance. The study indicates that RT with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ is a relatively safe treatment associated with longer survival in patients with 1p/19q codeleted and IDH1 mutated tumors. Results from ongoing randomized studies will be essential to clarify if RT plus TMZ may provide survival as good as or better than RT combined with PCV for patients with AO and AOA.

PROSPER supports local community teams in rural areas and small towns to implement evidence-based programs intended to support positive youth development and reduce early substance use. The study evaluated 14 community teams and included longitudinal data from 108 team members. Specifically, it examined how community demographics and team member characteristics, perceptions, and attitudes at initial team formation were related to local team functioning 6 months later, when teams were planning for prevention program implementation. Findings indicate that community demographics (poverty), perceived community readiness, characteristics of local team members (previous collaborative experience) and attitudes toward prevention played a substantial role in predicting the quality of community team functioning 6 months later. Editors’ Strategic Implications: The authors identify barriers to successful long-term implementation of prevention programs and add to a small, but important, longitudinal research knowledge base related to community coalitions.

The aim of the study is to clarify the clinical effects of first-line chemotherapy regimens for advanced urothelial cancer on clinical responses and survival of patients grouped by renal function.


METHODS
In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, 345 urothelial cancer patients received systemic chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable disease in 17 centers (2004-10).


RESULTS
Two hundred and forty-one patients were treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin/methotrexate, epirubicin and cisplatin (n = 136) or gemcitabine and cisplatin (n = 105) followed by carboplatin-based treatments, non-platinum treatments or other regimens. After 2008, gemcitabine and cisplatin was the most frequently used regimen in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The gemcitabine and cisplatin patients' complete response rate was 10.5% and their response rate was 52.4%, which was highest among all regimens. Gemcitabine and cisplatin demonstrated a better 3-year overall survival when the estimated glomerular filtration rate was ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (31.4%), but it tended to be worse when the estimated glomerular filtration rate was < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (14.1%). In the latter cases, the dose reduction rate of gemcitabine and cisplatin was high (43.9%). Among the patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the 1-year overall survival of the patients treated with a reduced dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin was significantly lower than that of those treated with standard-dose gemcitabine and cisplatin (26.2 vs. 60.3%, respectively, P = 0.0108).


CONCLUSIONS
Gemcitabine and cisplatin provided favorable responses and survival in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) but unsatisfactory oncological outcomes in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), especially when treated with a reduced dose. Alternative regimens might be optimal rather than reduced-dose gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)."

Effective utilization of UHTCs requires full densification of the materials from powder. UHTCs, especially, transition metal borides and carbides, have lower sinterability due to their high melting point (>3000 °C), strong covalent bonding, low bulk diffusion coefficient, and higher vapor pressure of the constituent elements present in the UHTCs. Among the available sintering techniques, spark plasma sintering (SPS) has been widely utilized to achieve fully dense powder compact along with uniform fine-grain microstructure, suitable for high-temperature applications. SPS is found to be advantageous over the conventional sintering techniques such as hot pressing (HP), hot isostatic pressing (HIP), pressureless sintering (PS), etc. because uniform fine-grain microstructure could be obtained via SPS due to considerably lower sintering temperature, high heating rate, lower holding time, and application of pulsed DC current along with uniaxial mechanical pressure during sintering schedule. In this chapter, the efficacy of SPS technique to sinter different UHTCs, especially monolithic transition metal borides, carbides, and mixed borides and carbides with/without sinter-aid or other secondary phase is elaborated. Microstructural evolution and enhancement of different properties, particularly the mechanical properties, by adopting suitable sintering scheme and sintering parameters are discussed in detail. Also, entropy-stabilized multicomponent UHTC borides (contains at least five transition metal borides in equimolar ratio) have been discussed to highlight the effectiveness of SPS technique to consolidate these types of materials. Finally, the application-oriented development of UHTCs for sharp leading edges of hypersonic space vehicle is briefed.	['102775350', '73006936', '35308325', '144900734']	[]	[]	2019

In order to push vaccine development and production, biomanufacturers use single-use technology whenand wherever possible. This applies to upstream processing and in particular seed-train expansion ranging from cryopreserved vials via t-flasks, spinners (respectively shake flasks) to stirred stainless steel bioreactors. The stainless steel bioreactors deliver inoculum for seed bioreactors and have been increasingly replaced by wave-mixed single-use bag bioreactors during the last 5 years [1]. The approach presented for seed-train cell expansion of High Five suspension cells is based on the Biostat CultiBag RM50 optical (Sartorius Stedim Biotech). It was used for the production of cells for long-term storage and for the expansion of cells for subsequent production experiments. For long-term storage the cells were frozen at high cell concentrations (20 40 x 10 cells x mL) in 60 mL Cryobags and stored in nitrogen at -196 °C in vapour phase. Initial experiments were aimed at the growth characterization of High Five suspension cells from a vial working cell bank (WCB). The High Five cells were grown in batch mode and in 250 mL single-use shake flasks (Corning and Sartorius Stedim Biotech) on a Certomat CT Plus shaker (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) during six days (triplicates, 27 °C, 100 rpm, 25 mm shaking diameter). Afterwards a procedure was developed in which thawed cells from a Cryobag were directly transferred into and expanded in a Biostat CultiBag RM. Under optimal process conditions (500 mL starting volume, a starting cell density of 1 x 10 cells x mL, 27 °C, rocking angle of 6 °, 20 30 rpm, 0.2 vvm, DO set point 50%) growth rate (0.039 0.042 h), doubling time (18 20 h) and maximal cell density (7.8 8.9 x 10 cells x mL) showed good correlation with results arising from CultiBags which were inoculated with cells from shake flasks. This bag-based seed-train expansion allows time saving of about one week and reduces cross-contamination, both advantages being due to omitted intermediate cultivation steps in shake flasks.

Bijections between various restricted partitions of integers have been extensively studied (see [2], [3]). In this paper we introduce a generalization of partitions, which are really a kind of restricted composition [3], and obtain bijections between certain classes of them and classes of ordinary partitions. Our generalization arises naturally in connection with solutions of q-difference equations and continued fractions. In fact, continued fractions provide an easy framework for analyzing these generalized partitions. Throughout this paper we write an ordinary partition as n1 + . . .+ nk, n1 ≥ . . . ≥ nk. Define n0 =∞ and nk+1 = 0. We consider the class C(S,m) of partitions with parts ni taken from a set S = {a1, a2, . . .}, where a1 < a2 < . . . We require that if ni = ar and ni+1 = as are two consecutive parts, then r−s ≥ m. For such a partition we define the gapspace gi between ni and ni+1 to be r − s−m. By convention we put g0 =∞ and gk = t−m, where nk = at. Before proceeding we give some examples of gapspaces.

Plasmon Resonance Imaging"	Exosomes are endosome-derived membrane vesicles carrying proteins and nucleic acids that are involved in cellular functions such as intercellular communication, protein and RNA secretion, and antigen presentation. Therefore, exosomes serve as potential biomarkers for many diseases including cancer. Because exosomes are difficult to enrich or purify from biofluids, quantification of exosomes is tedious and inaccurate. Here, we present a real-time, label-free, and quantitative method to detect and characterize tumor-derived exosomes without enrichment or purification. Utilizing surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) in combination with antibody microarrays specific to the extracellular domains of exosome membrane proteins, exosomes in tumor cell culture medium can be quantitatively detected. We found a positive correlation between the metastatic potential of tumor cell lines and exosome secretion. This method provides an easy, efficient, and novel way to detect exosome secretion and thus an avenue toward the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer.

As an application, we consider a characterization of relativistic quasistable states by irreducible representations of the causal Poincare semigroup and study the implications of the new theorem for this special case.

We describe a clinical trial to study the efficacy of a casein hydrolysate, prepared using an Aspergillus oryzae protease, containing the major angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 131 volunteers with high-normal blood pressure and mild hypertension were randomly divided into four groups (n 32 or 33 in each group). Each volunteer was given two tablets containing four different dosages of VPP and IPP (VPP+IPP: 0, 1.8, 2.5 and 3.6 mg), daily for 6 weeks. A significant decrease in systolic blood pressure was observed at 6 weeks in the active group receiving 1.8 mg (P<0.01) VPP and IPP; in the active groups receiving either 2.5 mg or 3.6 mg, systolic blood pressure was decreased at both 3 weeks (P<0.05 and P<0.05) and 6 weeks (P<0.001 and P<0.0001) compared with systolic blood pressure measured before treatment. Changes in the systolic blood pressure after 6 weeks of treatment in the four groups were --1.7, --6.3, --6.7 and --10.1 mmHg, and these effects were dose dependent. In addition, a significant difference in systolic blood pressure between the placebo group and the VPP and IPP group receiving 3.6 mg was observed (P<0.001) by two-way ANOVA. The antihypertensive effect was greater in mildly hypertensive subjects (n 20 or 21 in each group) than in any of the other subjects. No significant change of diastolic blood pressure was observed for all the test groups, and no differences in diastolic blood pressure in the test sample groups compared with the placebo group were observed during the test period.

Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) are used in research and clinical contexts to measure sustained attention and response inhibition. Reliability and validity of a new Online Continuous Performance Test (OCPT) was assessed. The OCPT is designed for delivery over the Internet, thereby opening new opportunities for research and clinical application in naturalistic settings. In Study 1, participants completed the OCPT twice over a 1-week period. One test was taken at home and one in the laboratory. Construct validity was assessed against a gold standard CPT measure. Results indicate acceptable reliability between the home- and laboratory-administered tests. Modest to high correlations were observed between the OCPT scales and the corresponding scales of the gold standard CPT. Study 2 examined whether the OCPT may discriminate participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from healthy controls. Results revealed significantly higher rates of omission and commission errors and greater response time variability in participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder relative to healthy controls. These results support the reliability and validity of the OCPT and suggest that it may serve as an effective tool for the assessment of attention function in naturalistic settings.

However, no study has examined the success or failure of these entries. Using a new definition of success and a uniquely compiled archival database, the authors analyze whether and why firms that entered China and India succeeded or failed. The most important findings are rather counterintuitive: Smaller firms are more successful than larger firms, and firms entering more open emerging markets have less success. Other findings are that success is greater with earlier entry, greater control of entry mode, and shorter cultural and economic distances between the home and the host countries. Importantly, with or without control for these drivers, firms have less success in India than in China. The authors discuss the reasons for and implications of these findings.

The criticism of the institutions and the suggested path for change demand a comprehensive historical study of the foundations of these educational institutions, a study that points out their failures and the available avenues for change. The historical study leads Nietzsche back to Socrates, who is not only the root of contemporary problems, but also a ripe source for new possibilities for education and culture. Socrates' multifarious character eluded the subsequent 'Socratic' culture, which only adopted the radically rationalist side of Socrates. Nietzsche excavates both the beautiful and the erotic sides of his character as exemplars for his educational reform. In the end, Nietzsche overcomes Socrates, so that Nietzsche himself becomes the exemplar for the new tragic culture and education when the limits of Socrates' character are reached.

Compared to the average upper crust and most granites, the U, Th and Cs concentrations are strongly depleted, probably because of the fluid and/or slight melt loss during the high-grade metamorphism (900–1050(C, 1·5–2·0 GPa). However, the rest of the trace-element contents and variation trends, such as decreasing Sr, Ba, Eu, LREE and Zr with increasing SiO2 and Rb, can be explained by fractional crystallisation of a granitic magma. Low Zr and LREE contents yield w750(C zircon and monazite saturation temperatures and suggest relatively low-temperature crystallisation. The granulites contain radiogenic Sr (Sr/Sr340= 0·7106–0·7706) and unradiogenic Nd ( 340 Nd = 4·2 to 7·5), indicating derivation from an old crustal source. The whole-rock Rb–Sr isotopic system preserves the memory of an earlier, probably Ordovician, isotopic equilibrium. Contrary to previous studies, the bulk of felsic Moldanubian granulites do not appear to represent separated, syn-metamorphic Variscan HP–HT melts. Instead, they are interpreted as metamorphosed (partly anatectic) equivalents of older, probably high-level granites subducted to continental roots during the Variscan collision. Protolith formation may have occurred within an Early Palaeozoic rift setting, which is documented throughout the Variscan Zone in Europe.

The article is devoted to the comprehension of the way the English romantic poetry is taken in Russia. The actuality of the investigation is stipulated by the necessity of examination of numerous facts of reception of English romantic poetry in Russia, done by the foregoing investigators, and by the necessity of revealing the typological affinity of the writers, their works, and acquisition of material in order to fully reconstruct the history of the Russian poetry. Materials and methods. The analysis was done on the basis of the works of the following English romantic poets G. Byron, T. Moore, W. Scott, R. Southey, S. Coleridge, W. Wordsworth and their Russian renderings of the 19 th and early 20 th century together with the works of Russian literature critics and publicists. There have been used the methods of culture and historic analysis, historic and genetic, and historic typological analyses. Results. In view of the above stated problems, three important aspects have been highlighted and analyzed, they are as follows: traditionally narrow minded perception of the English writer’s heritage both in Russian literature and in Russian literary criticism; great popularity of many works of the English writer in Russia in a short period of time and the transformation of the perception of his works due to the growth of his popularity in Russia of some other kind than in his homeland. Conclusions. As a result of the analysis some regulations have been found out concerning Russian perception of the English romanticism depending on the artistic preferences of the author in accordance with the specific social and literary trends that were growing in Russia at that time.

Ezetimibe is effective in providing additional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering when coadministered with statins, but its effect beyond LDL cholesterol lowering is unknown. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) is a better predictor of adverse cardiovascular events than standard lipid parameters. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ezetimibe on ox-LDL. A total of 100 patients with coronary artery disease or coronary artery disease equivalent were randomized to atorvastatin 40 mg/day and ezetimibe 10 mg/day or to atorvastatin 40 mg/day and placebo. LDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol subfractions, and ox-LDL were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. The ezetimibe group had a larger reduction in total LDL cholesterol compared to placebo. This was due mainly to a larger reduction in large buoyant LDL (24% vs 10%, p = 0.008). Ox-LDL level did not change in the placebo group (50 +/- 13 vs 51 +/- 13 U/L), while it decreased in the ezetimibe group, from 51 +/- 13 to 46 +/- 10 U/L (p = 0.01 vs baseline and p = 0.02 vs final level in placebo). The change in ox-LDL correlated significantly with those in total LDL and in large buoyant LDL (r = 0.6 and r = 0.5, respectively, p <0.01 for both), but not with that of small dense LDL, high-density lipoprotein, or very low density lipoprotein. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ezetimibe decreases ox-LDL cholesterol through reductions in total LDL cholesterol and in large buoyant LDL cholesterol.

The Bulgarian-born director is one of several foreigners who have made their mark on the German theatre. Gotscheff, who is 64, has worked steadily since the 1970s, but has risen to star status over the past decade with award-winning productions in Cologne, Dusseldorf, Bochum, and, most recently, in Berlin. His artistic success at such an advanced age resembles to some extent the career of the late George Tabori, another foreigner who has deeply influenced the German theatre; Tabori became a star director in the German theatre when he was in his late fifties and was still directing from his bedside at age 93. Gotscheff's work is distinct from that of other current German directors. He eschews the use of video that characterizes the work of directors such as Frank Castorf, Rene Pollesch, or Falk Richter, the musicality and inventiveness of Christoph Marthaler's productions, the brevity and the reliance on scenographic solutions in Michael Thalheimer's work, or the realist social critique that marks Thomas Ostermeier's work at the Berlin Schaubuhne. Instead, Gotscheff has championed Heiner Muller, redirecting and developing Muller's image space, interlacing of classic and contemporary texts, combination of genres, and exploration of the body. Born in the small Bulgarian town of Parvomei in 1943, Gotscheff moved with his family to East Berlin in 1962. Following his father's footsteps, he enrolled in a veterinary medicine program, but then switched to theatre studies at the Humboldt University. One of his inspirations for becoming a professional director was the Swiss director Benno Besson, whom Bertolt Brecht had invited to join the Berliner Ensemble in 1949. Gotscheff credits Besson with bringing a lighter touch to the Berliner Ensemble thanks to his focus on the precision of gesture and to his wonderful wit (Gotscheff). Besson's production of Aristophanes' Peace at the Deutsches Theater in 1963 proved so powerful that after the performance Gotscheff begged Besson to let him work on his productions (Simon). Besson, who was principal director at the Deutsches Theater between 1962 and 1968 and later artistic director at the Volksbuhne, also introduced Gotscheff to Heiner Muller's work through his own productions. Gotscheff's career began in the 1970s. He directed both in Bulgaria and in East Germany until 1979, when he left East Germany in protest against the expatriation of the political singer and songwriter Wolf Biermann. For a six-year period, he directed only in Bulgaria before he being invited to direct Muller's Quartet in Cologne (West Germany) in 1985. The Cologne invitation came as a result of Heiner Muller's own praise, presented in a public letter to Gotscheff, of Gotscheff's now-legendary production of Muller's Philoktet at the Sophia State Theatre in 1983. Since that successful production, Gotscheff has worked exclusively in the German theatre. He also held the administrative position of permanent in-house director at the Schauspielhaus Dusseldorf from 1993 to 1996 and at the Schauspielhaus Bochum from 1995 to 2000. He has received numerous awards, including the German Critics Award in 1991 and the 2005 Director of the Year award from critics surveyed by the journal Theater heute. Three of his productions have been selected over the past four years to perform at the annual Berlin Theatertreffen festival, the barometer for innovative productions in the German language theatre: Koltes's Black Battles with Dogs (2004); Ivanov (2006); and Tartuffe (2007). Most critics who enjoy Gotscheff's theatre agree with Norbert Mayer's assessment that his productions present the art of precise, political spectacle. Adopting a marked characteristic of Muller's work, Gotscheff often approaches a play as a ruin that needs to be explored or reconstructed through a new scenographic solution and by restructuring of character relationships. …	['143937877']	[]	[]	2008

The use of rehabilitation services to address musculoskeletal, neurological and cardiovascular late effects among childhood cancer survivors could improve physical function and health-related quality-of-life (HRQL). We describe physical therapy (PT) and chiropractic utilization among childhood cancer survivors and their association with HRQL.


METHODS
The sample included 5+ year survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (N = 9,289). Questions addressing use of PT or chiropractic services and HRQL (Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-36)) were evaluated. Multivariable regression models compared PT and/or chiropractic utilization between survivors and siblings, and by diagnosis, treatment and demographic characteristics; associations between chronic disease, PT/chiropractic use, and HRQL were similarly evaluated.


RESULTS
Survivors were not more likely to use PT (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.8-1.2) or chiropractic (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-1.0) services than siblings. More survivors reported using chiropractic (12.4%) than PT (9.2%) services. Older age and having health insurance were associated with utilization of either PT or chiropractic services. Grade 3-4 chronic conditions and a CNS tumor or sarcoma history were associated with PT but not with chiropractic service utilization. Survivors with musculoskeletal (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.9), neurological (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.6-6.9), or cardiovascular (OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6-6.9) chronic conditions who used PT/chiropractic services were more likely to report poor physical health than survivors who did not use services.


CONCLUSIONS
The reported prevalence of PT/chiropractic among survivors is consistent with that reported by siblings. Severity of late effects is associated with service use and with reporting poor physical health.

Muscle relaxation therapy assumes that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients lack the ability to relax but can learn this in therapy. We tested this by randomizing 49 GAD patients to 12 weeks of Applied Relaxation (AR) or waiting. Before, during, and after treatment participants underwent relaxation tests. Before treatment, GAD patients were more worried than healthy controls (n=21) and had higher heart rates and lower end-tidal pCO2, but not higher muscle tension (A. Conrad, L. Isaac, & W.T. Roth, 2008). AR resulted in greater symptomatic improvement than waiting. However, 28% of the AR group dropped out of treatment and some patients relapsed at the 6-week follow-up. There was little evidence that AR participants learned to relax in therapy or that a reduction in anxiety was associated with a decrease in activation. We conclude that the clinical effects of AR in improving GAD symptoms are moderate at most and cannot be attributed to reducing muscle tension or autonomic activation.

The pleiotropic actions of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) include antiinflammatory and antioxidant actions. We recently reported that statins induce reductions in plasma protein levels of nitrotyrosine (NO2Tyr), a modification generated by nitric oxide-derived oxidants. Whether alternative oxidative pathways are suppressed in vivo after statin administration has not yet been reported.


METHODS AND RESULTS
As an extension of our prior study, hypercholesterolemic subjects with no known coronary artery disease were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks of atorvastatin therapy (10 mg/d). Plasma levels of protein-bound chlorotyrosine, NO2Tyr, dityrosine, and orthotyrosine, specific molecular fingerprints for distinct oxidative pathways upregulated in atheroma, were determined by mass spectrometry. In parallel, alterations in lipoproteins and C-reactive protein were determined. Statin therapy caused significant reductions in chlorotyrosine, NO2Tyr, and dityrosine (30%, 25%, and 32%, respectively; P<0.02 each) that were similar in magnitude to reductions in total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B-100 (25% and 29%, P<0.001 each). Nonsignificant decreases in orthotyrosine and C-reactive protein levels were observed (9% and 11%, respectively; P>0.10 each). Statin-induced reductions in oxidation markers were independent of decreases in lipids and lipoproteins.


CONCLUSIONS
Statins promote potent systemic antioxidant effects through suppression of distinct oxidation pathways. The major pathways inhibited include formation of myeloperoxidase-derived and nitric oxide-derived oxidants, species implicated in atherogenesis. The present results suggest potential mechanisms that may contribute to the beneficial actions of statins. They also have important implications for monitoring the antiinflammatory and antioxidant actions of these agents."

Cerebral palsy requires appropriate on-going rehabilitation intervention which should effectively meet the needs of both children and parents/care-givers. The provision of effective support is a challenge, particularly in resource constrained settings. A quasi-experimental pragmatic research design was used to compare the impact of two models of rehabilitation service delivery currently offered in Harare, Zimbabwe, an outreach-based programme and the other institution-based.


METHOD
Questionnaires were distributed to 46 caregivers of children with cerebral palsy at baseline and after three months. Twenty children received rehabilitation services in a community setting and 26 received services as outpatients at a central hospital. The Gross Motor Function Measurement was used to assess functional change. The burden of care was measured using the Caregiver Strain Index, satisfaction with physiotherapy was assessed using the modified Medrisk satisfaction with physiotherapy services questionnaire and compliance was measured as the proportion met of the scheduled appointments.


RESULTS
Children receiving outreach-based treatment were significantly older than children in the institution-based group. Regression analysis revealed that, once age and level of severity were controlled for, children in the outreach-based treatment group improved their motor function 6% more than children receiving institution-based services. There were no differences detected between the groups with regard to caregiver well-being and 51% of the caregivers reported signs consistent with clinical distress/depression. Most caregivers (83%) expressed that they were overwhelmed by the caregiving role and this increased with the chronicity of care. The financial burden of caregiver was predictive of caregiver strain. Caregivers in the outreach-based group reported greater satisfaction with services and were more compliant (p < .001) as compared to recipients of institution-based services.


CONCLUSION
Long term caregiving leads to strain in caregivers and there is a need to design interventions to alleviate the burden. The study was a pragmatic, quasi-experimental study thus causality cannot be inferred. However findings from this study suggest that the provision of care within a community setting as part of a well-structured outreach programme may be preferable method of service delivery within a resource-constrained context. It was associated with a greater improvement in functioning, greater satisfaction with services and better compliance."

Twenty-three patients with osteoid osteomas in common (nine cases) and technically challenging [14 cases: intra-articular (n = 7), spinal (n = 5), metaphyseal (n = 2)] positions were treated with CT-guided RF ablation. Therapy was performed under conscious sedation with a seven-array expandable RF electrode for 8–10 min at 80–110°C and power of 90–110 W. The patients went home under instruction. A brief pain inventory (BPI) score was calculated before and after (1 day, 4 weeks, 6 months and 1 year) treatment. All procedures were technically successful. Primary clinical success was 91.3% (21 of total 23 patients), despite the lesions’ locations. BPI score was dramatically reduced after the procedure, and the decrease in BPI score was significant (P < 0.001, paired t-test; n − 1 = 22) for all periods during follow up. Two patients had persistent pain after 1 month and were treated successfully with a second procedure (secondary success rate 100%). No immediate or delayed complications were observed. CT-guided RF ablation is safe and highly effective for treatment of osteoid osteomas, even in technically difficult positions.

Elevated endorphin levels in patients with COPD may act to diminish the sensation of dyspnea. Exogenous opioids decrease exertional dyspnea and increase exercise capacity in COPD patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of endogenous opioids on the exercise capacity and control of breathing in patients with COPD. We hypothesized that naloxone, an opioid antagonist, would block the endogenous endorphins and decrease the exercise capacity of our patients. Six patients (mean age, 58.8 +/- 3.2 years) with COPD (mean FEV1, 1.28 +/- 0.46 L) underwent identical incremental cycle ergometer tests to exhaustion (Emax) and assessment of their hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses and mouth occlusion pressure responses following the IV administration of naloxone (0.4 mg/kg) (N) or placebo (P) in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Perceived dyspnea (modified Borg scale), breathing patterns, and expired gas levels were compared at rest and at maximal workload (WL). There was no significant difference after N compared with after P in the WL or the duration of work. At Emax there were no significant differences after N compared with after P in ventilation, the level of dyspnea, P0.1, VO2, or VCO2.

This study developed a self-efficacy enhancement program and evaluated its effects on the self-care behaviors, self-care knowledge, and self-efficacy regarding pressure ulcer prevention in patients with a spinal cord injury.


METHODS
This was a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Six hospitals were invited to recruit patients with a spinal cord injury who were undergoing rehabilitation after receiving acute treatment. These hospitals were randomly allocated into experimental (three hospitals) or control (three hospitals) groups and 47 patients participated (24 in the experimental group and 23 in the control group). The experimental group was given an 8 week self-efficacy enhancement program for pressure ulcer prevention. The self-efficacy enhancement program consisted of small-group face-to-face intervention (education and skills training), education with computer animation, phone counseling, face-to-face counseling, and self-management records. The control group only received a pressure ulcer prevention information booklet. Self-care knowledge, self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and pressure ulcer incidence were measured at baseline and after the 8 week self-efficacy enhancement program.


RESULTS
The experimental group showed a significantly greater improvement in self-care knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care behaviors for pressure ulcer prevention than did the control group. One participant in the control group developed a pressure ulcer, while none of the participants in the experimental group developed a pressure ulcer; this difference was not statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The self-efficacy enhancement program enabled patients with a spinal cord injury to engage in continued self-care behaviors and helped them to improve their knowledge and self-efficacy concerning pressure ulcer prevention."

A genome-wide association study identified variants in or near patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing-3 (PNPLA3), neurocan (NCAN), lysophospholipase-like 1 (LYPLAL1), glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3b (PPP1R3B) that were strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults of European ancestry.


OBJECTIVE
We examined these genetic variants in obese children and tested whether their effects on NAFLD are significant in the Taiwanese Han Chinese population.


DESIGN
We genotyped PNPLA3 rs738409, NCAN rs2228603, LYPLAL1 rs12137855, GCKR rs780094, and PPP1R3B rs4240624 in 797 obese children aged 7-18 y. NAFLD was identified by liver ultrasonography. We analyzed the effect of these genetic variants on NAFLD.


RESULTS
NAFLD was identified in 24% of the recruited obese children. We found significant associations with NAFLD at variants in PNPLA3 and GCKR but not in NCAN, LYPLAL1, and PPP1R3B. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that, after control for the effects of age- and sex-adjusted body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, sex, and PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism, the variant GCKR rs780094 TT genotype independently increased the OR of NAFLD by 1.997 (95% CI: 1.196, 3.335; P = 0.008) compared with the CC genotype. Subjects with the variant GCKR rs780094 TT genotype had a higher mean serum alanine aminotransferase concentration than did those with the CC genotype (30.8 ± 34.7 compared with 22.2 ± 18.6 IU/L; P = 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
By studying the genetic variants of obese Taiwanese children, we confirmed that the genetic variants in GCKR rs780094 and PNPLA3 rs738409, but not in NCAN rs2228603, LYPLAL1 rs12137855, and PPP1R3B rs4240624, are associated with an increased risk of NAFLD. GCKR and PNPLA3 variants are the common genetic factors that may confer susceptibility to NAFLD in obese individuals across multiple ethnic groups."

The inability of endothelial cells of patients affected by the diffuse form of Systemic sclerosis (SSc) to perform angiogenesis is a marker of the disease. We previously demonstrated that desmoglein-2 reduction is a major difference between (SSc)-microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and normal (N)-MVECs. Here we investigated the role of desmoglein-2 in human N-MVECs and SSc-MVECs angiogenesis.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Angiogenesis was studied by Matrigel invasion, capillary morphogenesis in vitro and Matrigel plug assay in vivo. Gene profiling was studied by Affymetrix technology and signal transduction by Western blotting. Colocalization was validated by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. SiRNAs were used to validate the roles of specific molecules. We observed that desmoglein-2 co-localizes with integrin-beta8 in N-MVECs. This complex is required to signal through Rac, FAK, SMAD1/5 and MAP-kinases, promoting an angiogenic program. Inhibition of desmoglein-2 by DSG2-siRNA impaired actin stress fibres formation, capillary morphogenesis in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Transcriptome profiling after DSG2 inhibition revealed alterations of several genes involved in actin organization. siRNA inhibition of integrin-beta8 and RAC2 also resulted into capillary morphogenesis impairment in N-MVECs, due to reduced expression of the same actin-assembly genes that were down-regulated by DSG2 silencing. SSc-MVECs showed down-regulation of the same genes in DSG2-siRNA treated N-MVECs, suggesting that impairment of desmoglein-2/integrin-beta8 complex contributes to angiogenesis derangement in SSc. Transfection of DSG2 in SSc-MVEC partially restored their angiogenic properties in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
We have shown that impairment of actin assembly as a result of desmoglein-2/integrin-beta8 complex formation is a major factor contributing to angiogenesis deregulation in Systemic sclerosis."

The beneficial effects of prebiotics on bowel health were thoroughly investigated. The aim of the study was to show prebiotic effects of polydextrose (PDX). A placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study with PDX supplementation (8 g/day) was conducted in 45 healthy subjects. The effects of PDX on stool weight, orofaecal transit time, consistency of stool (Bristol stool form scale), short-chain fatty acid production, pH value, neutral sterol and bile acid excretion and faecal microbiota were evaluated. It was found that supplementation of PDX shortened the orofaecal transit time significantly. Furthermore, ingestion of PDX resulted in a decreased pH value and in significant changes in bile acid and neutral sterol excretion. PDX had no effects on stool weight, concentrations of the main short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate) and faecal contents of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. In conclusion, PDX is able to shorten the orofaecal transit time and to improve stool consistency in subjects suffering from constipation.

Besides the classical role of vitamin D on calcium and bone homeostasis, vitamin D deficiency has recently been identified as a contributing factor in the onset of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, it is uncertain whether vitamin D deficiency and poor glycaemic control are causally interrelated or that they constitute two independent features of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are limited clinical trials carried out which measured the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control.The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.


METHODS/DESIGN
In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in five general practices in the Netherlands three hundred patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with lifestyle advises or metformin or sulphonylurea-derivatives are randomised to receive either placebo or 50,000 IU Vitamin D3 at monthly intervals. The primary outcome measure is the change in glycated haemoglobin level between baseline and six months. Secondary outcome measures include blood pressure, anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, insulin resistance, quality of life, advanced glycation end products and safety profiles. Quality of life will be measured by The Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey questionnaire. Advanced glycation end products are measured by an AGE-reader.


DISCUSSION
This trial will be the first study exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on both glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our findings will contribute to the knowledge of the relationship between vitamin D status and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

A great deal, argues David Underdown. Using three western counties as a case-study, he shows that the war was neither a dispute confined to the elite nor a class struggle of the 'middling sort' against a discredited aristocracy. It was in fact the result of profound disagreements among people of all social levels about the moral basis of their communities; commoners as well as ruler held strong opinions about order and governance. But these opinions varied from place to place, and through a pioneering synthesis of social history and popular culture, Underdown relates political diversity to cultural diversity, and shows that local difference in popular allegiance in the Civil War coincided with regional contrast in the traditional festive culture. The book is thus an important reinterpretation of both the English Revolution and the relationship between society, politics, and culture in the seventeenth century.	['65978354']	[]	[]	1987

Allergen-specific immunotherapy is a proven, highly effective treatment for IgE-mediated diseases. However, ultra-rush immunotherapy is prescribed infrequently because of the perception that accelerated immunotherapy buildup leads to a higher rate of systemic reactions.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the frequency of adverse reactions in patients with IgE-mediated diseases receiving house dust mite (HDM) ultra-rush immunotherapy.


METHODS
A retrospective, observational study was conducted for patients with IgE-mediated diseases receiving allergen-specific immunotherapy. Subcutaneous immunotherapy with depigmented polymerized mites extract was administered in two refracted doses of 0.2 and 0.3 ml at first injection, and in single 0.5 ml doses in subsequent monthly injections. A 30 min observation time was required after each injection. Systemic reactions were graded using the World Allergy Organisation grading system.


RESULTS
575 patients were included. The age range was 1-83 years. Most patients had respiratory diseases (544) and 101 patients had atopic dermatitis. A total of 27 patients (4.6%) experienced 139 reactions (reactions/injections: 1.9%); 22 patients (3.8%) experienced 134 local reactions (local reactions/injections: 1.8%). Eight patients (1.3%) experienced eight systemic reactions (systemic reactions/injections: 0.1%). Five systemic reactions were grade 2 and three grade 1. Two systemic reactions were reported during buildup. There were no fatalities.


CONCLUSION
Taking into account the possible bias for the retrospective design of this study we observed that immunotherapy for patients with IgE-mediated diseases using a depigmented polymerized mites extract, with an ultra-rush buildup, has similar frequency of systemic reactions than that seen in slower buildup immunotherapy in other studies. Accelerated buildup could improve patients' adherence and reduce dropout rates."

We set out to evaluate their predictive value in the clinical outcomes of patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We determined the complement levels C3, C3a, sC5b-9 and also the N-terminus of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 126 heart failure patients in a prospective, single-center observational study before and 6 months after CRT implantation. CRT reduced the C3a [212.5 (148.2–283.6) vs. 153 (119.8–218.3) ng/mL, p < 0.0001] and the sC5b-9 levels [296.9 (234.2–358.8) vs. 255.1 (210.1–319.0) ng/mL, p = 0.0006], but not the total C3 levels [1.43 (1.26–1.61) vs. 1.38 (1.23–1.57) g/L, p = 0.57]. C3a predicted the 5-year mortality of the patients [C3a > 165 ng/mL hazard ratio = 4.21 (1.65–10.72), p = 0.003] independent of the NT-proBNP and other factors. After reclassification, we observed a significant net reclassification improvement [NRI = 0.71 (0.43–0.98), p < 0.0001] and integrated discrimination improvement [IDI = 0.08 (0.03–0.12), p = 0.0002]. In patients with CRT, elevated C3a levels increase the risk of mortality independent of the NT-proBNP levels or other factors. CRT exerts anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the complement activation.

At ultrahigh energies this may allow the existence of neutrino-initiated extensive air showers. In this paper, we examine the most relevant observables of such showers. Our analysis indicates that the future Pierre Auger Observatory could be potentially powerful in probing models with large compact dimensions.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the therapeutic value of initiating a beta-blocker before an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in the treatment of heart failure.


BACKGROUND
Although ACEI and carvedilol produce benefits in heart failure, whether the order of initiation of therapy determines the impact on left ventricular (LV) function and New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA FC) has not been determined.


METHODS
A single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label study was performed. We evaluated whether initiation of therapy with carvedilol either before (n = 38) or after (n = 40) perindopril therapy in newly diagnosed patients in NYHA FC II to III heart failure with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, with the addition of the alternative agent after six months, determined subsequent changes in NYHA FC and LV function (echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography). Study drugs were titrated to maximum tolerable doses.


RESULTS
There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the study groups. After 12 months 11 patients died (6 in the group where the ACEI was initiated). At 12 months the group receiving carvedilol as initial therapy achieved a higher tolerable dose of carvedilol (43 +/- 17 mg vs. 33 +/- 18 mg, p = 0.03); a lower dose of furosemide (p < 0.05); and better improvements in symptoms (NYHA FC, p < 0.002), LV ejection fraction (radionuclide: 15 +/- 16% vs. 6 +/- 13%, p < 0.05; echocardiographic, p < 0.01), and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (p < 0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
As opposed to the conventional sequence of drug use in the treatment of heart failure, initiation of therapy with carvedilol before an ACEI results in higher tolerable doses of carvedilol and better improvements in FC and LV function."

We sought to evaluate, in a double-blind, randomized, prospective study, safety and efficacy of elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), with pharmacotherapy consisting of antiplatelet therapy and no anticoagulation therapy.


BACKGROUND
Available guidelines recommend systemic anticoagulation agent use during PCI. Significant debate remains, however, with regard to the correlation between the effects of systemic anticoagulation therapy and ensuing ischemic and hemorrhagic complications.


METHODS
From June 2005 to January 2007, 700 patients undergoing elective PCI of an uncomplicated lesion have been prospectively enrolled in the protocol. Patients should have been on aspirin and thienopyridine therapy and were assigned either to the control arm (70 to 100 UI/kg unfractionated heparin) or to the no-heparin arm. A clinical assessment was obtained before hospital discharge and at 30 days after PCI.


RESULTS
Procedural success was obtained in 100% of the cases. No acute or subacute thrombosis was observed. The absence of anticoagulation therapy was associated with a significant decrease in post-procedural myocardial damage (p = 0.03) and bleeding events (p = 0.048). At 30 days, the primary end point (death, myocardial infarction, or urgent target vessel revascularization) was more frequent in the control arm than in the no-heparin arm (2.0% vs. 3.7%, respectively; absolute risk reduction 1.7% [95% confidence interval: -0.1% to 4.5%], p for superiority = 0.17, p for noninferiority <0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
In the treatment of uncomplicated lesions and in the presence of dual antiplatelet therapy, elective PCI can be safely performed without systemic anticoagulation and is associated with a reduced incidence of bleeding complications."

In Guimond's formulation issues like growth, equality, and national identity came under the rubric of the Dream as it has been used to measure how well the nation is living up to its social and political ideals. A pathbreaking book, American Photography and the American Dream examines the most important photographers and developments in the documentary genre during this century. It encompasses the reform-era images of Francis Benjamin Johnston and Lewis Hine; the work of Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographers like Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange during both the 1930s and 1940s after the FSA photography unit broke up; the American-Way-of-Life pictures published by Life , Look , and the United States Information Agency during the 1940s and 1950s; the iconoclastic images of William Klein, Diane Arbus, and Robert Frank; and the work of four photographers of the 1970s and 1980s: Bill Owens, Chauncey Hare, Susan Meiselas, and Michael Williamson. Guimond pays close attention to the specific historical circumstances in which the pictures were made, to the roles the photographers played in making their images, to their intentions, stated and unstated, and to the original contexts in which the images were published or exhibited. These images, he shows, are not merely pictures on museum walls but revelations that can help us understand how we as Americans have seen ourselves, one another, and the world around us.

"With the rapid aging of Japan's population, medical professionals who specialize in geriatric medicine are in unprecedented demand. At Ehime University School of Medicine, the Department of Geriatric Medicine was established on April 1,1997. To assess the status of geriatric medicine in undergraduate education, we surveyed the opinions of medical students on geriatric medicine. A questionnaire was sent to both fourth-year medical students before their classes on internal medicine and geriatric medicine had ended and to sixth-year medical students after their classes had already ended. Medical students of Ehime University School of Medicine had significantly more interest in geriatric medicine than students at other medical schools. From a clinical viewpoint of problems in old age, they considered that cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disorders, neurocognitive disorders and pulmonary disease were important. A total of 60% agreed that all medical schools should have classes in geriatric medicine, which is a higher rate than that of previous reports. To study the opinions of medical students on textbooks on geriatrics, we also conducted a questionnaire among medical students. Although 90% of students had their own textbooks of internal medicine and almost half (42%) had textbooks on physical examination, none had their own textbook of geriatric medicine. The most frequent reason was ""hard to choose the best textbook"". The present study indicates that to develop education in geriatric medicine, it is important to make a recommendable text book for medical students, which is easily understood with high quality and originality."

However, with routine weekly treatment, it may take several weeks to achieve remission, and to date, the efficacy of a more frequent treatment schedule remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of intensive GMA treatment in patients with active UC.METHODS:This was an open-label, prospective, randomized multicenter study to compare an intensive, two GMA sessions per week, with the routine, one GMA session per week. A total of 163 patients with mild-to-moderately active UC were randomly assigned to routine weekly treatment or intensive treatment. The maximum number of sessions of GMA permitted was 10. However, when patients achieved remission, GMA was discontinued. Remission rate at the end of the study, time to remission, and adverse events were assessed in both groups.RESULTS:Of the 163 patients, 149 were available for efficacy analysis as per protocol, 76 were in weekly GMA, and 73 were in intensive GMA. At the end of the study period, clinical remission was achieved in 41 of 76 patients (54.0%) in weekly GMA and in 52 of 73 patients (71.2%) in intensive GMA (P=0.029). The mean time to remission was 28.1±16.9 days in the weekly GMA treatment group and 14.9±9.5 days in the intensive GMA group (P<0.0001). Intensive GMA was well tolerated without GMA-related serious adverse side effects.CONCLUSIONS:Intensive GMA in patients with active UC seems to be more efficacious than weekly treatment, and significantly reduced the patients' morbidity time without increasing the incidence of side effects.

There are substantial sex differences in all levels of alcohol involvement among U.S. adults. The goal of this study was to test whether the magnitude and sources of genetic and environmental influences on liability for alcohol abuse and dependence differ for men and women.


METHODS
Structured personal interviews were used to assess DSM-III-R- and DSM-IV-defined alcohol abuse and dependence among 5091 male and 4168 female twins (including 1546 identical, 1128 same-sex fraternal, and 1423 opposite-sex pairs) born in Virginia between 1934 and 1974. Twin correlations were analyzed using structural equation modeling.


RESULTS
The magnitude of twin-pair resemblance was similar across several definitions of alcoholism and was substantially higher among identical than fraternal pairs. The proportion of population variation in liability attributed to genetic factors was substantial among both women (55-66%) and men (51-56%), and we found little evidence of a role of environmental factors shared by family members. In all definitions studied, we could reject a model that the genetic sources of liability in the two sexes overlap completely.


CONCLUSION
In this first population-based study of alcoholism among male and female twins from the U.S., we found that genetic factors play a major role in the development of alcoholism in both sexes, that the magnitudes of genetic influence were equally high for men and women, and that the genetic sources of vulnerability are partially, but not completely, overlapping in men and women."

In this paper, we propose RoboPlanner, a framework to generate action plans in autonomous robots. In RoboPlanner, we model the knowledge of world models, robotic capabilities and task templates using knowledge property graphs and graph databases. Design time queries and robotic perception are used to enable intelligent action planning, that can adapt at runtime. We demonstrate these solutions on autonomous picker robots deployed in Industry 4.0 warehouses.

This study tested the stability of the AQ20 – a dichotomous-response measure of health status in asthma, using parameters estimated by a Rasch model. One hundred forty-four asthma patients completed the AQ20 on five occasions over 3 months. At visit 1, two items showed significant misfit and were deleted. At each visit, the overall mean item–person and item–trait interaction statistics from the remaining 18 items (AQ18) were very similar. The repeatability of the item calibrations was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.95), despite the patients’ health having changed (repeated-measures ANOVA: FEV1 and AQ18 score p<0.0001). Tests of differential item functioning (DIF) over time showed that one item increased in severity. This item refers to ability to garden, and changes in response patterns could be related to seasonal changes over the study period. We conclude that this study has highlighted the usefulness of multiple repeat assessments which allow items to be tested for DIF over time. This is important as inclusion of ‘time-dependent’ items in a questionnaire may reduce the reliability of the instrument.

To determine whether a multiple-dose series of an inactivated whole cell mycobacterial vaccine, Mycobacterium vaccae, can prevent HIV-associated tuberculosis.


DESIGN AND METHODS
The DarDar trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The study was carried in an outpatient facility in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts of at least 200 cells/microl and a Bacille Calmette-Guérin scar were chosen for the study. The intervention was carried out by random 1:1 assignment to five intradermal doses of M. vaccae or placebo. Tuberculin skin tests were performed, and patients with reactions of at least 5 mm were administered isoniazid for 6 months. The main outcome measures were disseminated (primary endpoint), definite, and probable tuberculosis (secondary endpoints).


RESULTS
Two thousand thirteen individuals were randomized (1006 to M. vaccae, 1007 to placebo) and followed every 3 months for a median of 3.3 years. The trial was terminated early because of slow accrual of cases of disseminated tuberculosis and significant protection against definite tuberculosis. Hazard ratios were disseminated tuberculosis 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.21-1.34; seven cases in M. vaccae, 13 cases in placebo; log-rank P = 0.16), definite tuberculosis 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.39-0.96; 33 cases in M. vaccae, 52 cases in placebo; P = 0.03), and probable tuberculosis 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.76-1.80; 48 cases in M. vaccae, 40 cases in placebo; P = 0.46). Immunization was well tolerated, with no adverse effect on CD4 cell count or HIV viral load, and no increase in the rate of serious adverse events.


CONCLUSION
Administration of a multiple-dose series of M. vaccae to HIV-infected adults with childhood Bacille Calmette-Guérin immunization is safe and is associated with significant protection against definite tuberculosis. These results provide evidence that immunization with a whole cell mycobacterial vaccine is a viable strategy for the prevention of HIV-associated tuberculosis."

For example, people readily care about acts of terrorism and humanitarian crises because they appeal to our compassion for human suffering. These struggles also command attention where social interactions have the power to produce or intensify the emotional responses of those who participate in them. From passionate protests to poignant speeches, Andrew A. G. Ross analyzes high-emotion events with an eye to how they shape public perception and finds that there is no single answer. The politically powerful play to the public's emotions to advance their political aims, and such appeals to emotion often serve to sustain existing values and institutions. But the affective dimension can also produce profound change, particularly when a struggle in the present can be shown to line up with emotionally resonant events from the past. Extending his findings to well-studied conflicts, including the ""war on terror"" and the violence in Rwanda and the Balkans, Ross identifies important sites of emotional impact missed by earlier research focused on identities and institutional interests."

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with fecal dysbiosis. Fecal microbial transplant (FMT) is a potential therapeutic option for individuals with CD based on the hypothesis that changing the fecal dysbiosis could promote less intestinal inflammation.


METHODS
Nine patients, aged 12 to 19 years, with mild-to-moderate symptoms defined by Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI of 10-29) were enrolled into a prospective open-label study of FMT in CD (FDA IND 14942). Patients received FMT by nasogastric tube with follow-up evaluations at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. PCDAI, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin were evaluated at each study visit.


RESULTS
All reported adverse events were graded as mild except for 1 individual who reported moderate abdominal pain after FMT. All adverse events were self-limiting. Metagenomic evaluation of stool microbiome indicated evidence of FMT engraftment in 7 of 9 patients. The mean PCDAI score improved with patients having a baseline of 19.7 ± 7.2, with improvement at 2 weeks to 6.4 ± 6.6 and at 6 weeks to 8.6 ± 4.9. Based on PCDAI, 7 of 9 patients were in remission at 2 weeks and 5 of 9 patients who did not receive additional medical therapy were in remission at 6 and 12 weeks. No or modest improvement was seen in patients who did not engraft or whose microbiome was most similar to their donor.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to demonstrate that FMT for CD may be a possible therapeutic option for CD. Further prospective studies are required to fully assess the safety and efficacy of the FMT in patients with CD."

After resection surgery for Crohn's disease, recurrence of endoscopic lesions at the site of the anastomosis or in the neoterminal ileum is graded according to the Rutgeerts score (RS). The goal of this study was to test the interobserver variability for RS.


METHODS
Thirteen trained endoscopists evaluated the RS on 39 videotapes of patients who had undergone resection for Crohn's disease with an ileocolonic anastomosis 6 months earlier. Videotapes were randomly assigned to endoscopists through a balanced incomplete block design. Each videotape was scored independently by four endoscopists, and each endoscopist evaluated 12 videotapes, making a total of 156 videotape assessments. Reproducibility levels of the RS were assessed through unweighted kappa estimates among multiple raters. The proportion of inappropriate therapeutic initiation was estimated by randomly selecting one endoscopist for each videorecording, assuming that the majority of endoscopists correctly classified endoscopic recurrence.


RESULTS
The kappa estimates were 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.52) for the RS on a 5-grade scale, 0.47 (0.28-0.66) for RS < i2 vs. ≥ i2, and 0.64 (0.42-0.85) for RS ≤ i2 vs. > i2. The percentages of inappropriate therapeutic initiation were 12.8% (3.8-21.9) when initiation was triggered by a RS ≥ i2 and 8.3% (1.1-15.6) when initiation was triggered by a RS > i2 (p = 0.41).


CONCLUSION
The reproducibility of the RS was moderate, especially when differentiating 10% of patients."

We pooled data from both arms of a phase III trial in which patients with locally advanced (T3/4) rectal cancer were randomized to preoperative RCT alone or combined with pelvic radio-frequency hyperthermia. After surgery, R0-resected patients were scheduled to adjuvant chemotherapy with four monthly courses of 50 mg folinic acid (FA) and gradually escalated 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 350–500 mg/m2, days 1–5). Reasons preventing initiation of chemotherapy and treatment-related toxicities were evaluated. Patients’ characteristics and survival parameters were compared between the treated and untreated patient groups. Out of 93 patients, 73 (79%) started adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas 19 (21%) did not, mostly due to perioperative complications and refusal. Chemotherapy-related toxicities were mild to moderate in most cases, but—together with protracted postoperative complications—prevented the intended dose escalation of 5-FU in 71% of patients. Distant-failure-free (p=0.03) and overall survival (p=0.03) were improved in the chemotherapy group, although there was a negative selection of patients with unfavourable characteristics into the untreated patient group. Adjuvant chemotherapy using FA and 5-FU can be safely applied to the majority of patients with rectal cancer pretreated by RCT and surgery. Survival data are not suitable to allow far-reaching conclusions, but are in line with suggestions of a favourable effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients.

Eplerenone is a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; however, little is known about its effects on insulin action. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of eplerenone on insulin action in hypertensive adults, using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp. A randomised, controlled, double-blind, crossover design was employed. After a 6-week washout period, hypertensive, non-diabetic patients were treated with either eplerenone 25 mg twice daily or doxazosin 2 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. After each treatment period, insulin action was assessed by a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, with isotope dilution methodology. After washout, treatment groups were crossed over. Fifteen patients completed the study. There were no differences in fasting glucose, or fasting insulin between treatment with eplerenone or doxazosin. The measure of overall insulin sensitivity, exogenous glucose infusion rates during the last 30 min of the clamp, was similar with both treatments; 23.4 (3.9) μmol kg−1 min−1 after eplerenone and 23.3 (3.6) μmol kg−1 min−1 after doxazosin (P=0.83). Isotopically determined fasting endogenous glucose production rates were similar after both treatments (eplerenone 9.4 (0.6) μmol kg−1 min−1 vs doxazosin 10.6 (0.7) μmol kg−1 min−1). There was a trend for lower endogenous glucose production rates during hyperinsulinaemia following eplerenone compared with doxazosin (2.0 (0.8) μmol kg−1 min−1 vs 4.1 (0.9) μmol kg−1 min−1). There was no difference in insulin stimulated peripheral glucose utilisation rates after treatment with eplerenone or doxazosin (25.4 (3.6) μmol kg−1 min−1 vs 27.0 (3.9) μmol kg−1 min−1). This study gives reassuring evidence of the neutral effect of eplerenone on insulin action in hypertensive, non-diabetic patients.

Flight simulators have been used to train pilots to experience and recognize spatial disorientation, a condition in which pilots incorrectly perceive the position, location, and movement of their aircrafts. However, during or after simulator training, simulator sickness (SS) may develop. Spatial disorientation and SS share common symptoms and signs and may involve a similar mechanism of dys-synchronization of neural inputs from the vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive systems. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a maneuver used for pain control, was found to influence autonomic cardiovascular responses and enhance visuospatial abilities, postural control, and cognitive function. The purpose of present study was to investigate the protective effects of TENS on SS.


METHODS
Fifteen healthy young men (age: 28.6 ± 0.9 years, height: 172.5 ± 1.4 cm, body weight: 69.3 ± 1.3 kg, body mass index: 23.4 ± 1.8 kg/m2) participated in this within-subject crossover study. SS was induced by a flight simulator. TENS treatment involved 30 minutes simultaneous electrical stimulation of the posterior neck and the right Zusanli acupoint. Each subject completed 4 sessions (control, SS, TENS, and TENS + SS) in a randomized order. Outcome indicators included SS symptom severity and cognitive function, evaluated with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and d2 test of attention, respectively. Sleepiness was rated using the Visual Analogue Scales for Sleepiness Symptoms (VAS-SS). Autonomic and stress responses were evaluated by heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary stress biomarkers (salivary alpha-amylase activity and salivary cortisol concentration).


RESULTS
Simulator exposure increased SS symptoms (SSQ and VAS-SS scores) and decreased the task response speed and concentration. The heart rate, salivary stress biomarker levels, and the sympathetic parameter of HRV increased with simulator exposure, but parasympathetic parameters decreased (p < 0.05). After TENS treatment, SS symptom severity significantly decreased and the subjects were more able to concentrate and made fewer cognitive test errors (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Sympathetic activity increased and parasympathetic activity decreased after simulator exposure. TENS was effective in reducing SS symptoms and alleviating cognitive impairment.

People with dementia develop problems in coping with activities of daily living, including orientation and way-finding tasks. People with moderate to severe dementia are withdrawn and sensitive, which can make caring for and working with them challenging, especially for caregivers. Our work focusses on people with moderate to severe dementia and nursing homes. Building upon previous work in supporting way-finding for people with dementia, we propose an integrated platform to support caregivers and other stakeholders in localizing people and monitoring their whereabouts. Real-time monitoring, a history of location data and heat maps help caregivers to quickly locate people, identify critical situations and learn about preferred locations of residents. Doctors, technology and architectural designers receive valuable data on movement patterns that support diagnosis and intervention planning.

The prominent melting point depression of nanoparticles has been the subject of a considerable amount of research. For their promising applications in electronics, tin-based nano-alloys such as near-eutectic Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) alloys have been synthesized via various techniques. However, due to issues such as particle aggregation and oxidation or introduced impurities, the application of these nano-size particles has been confined or aborted. For instance, thermal investigations by DTA/DSC in a large number of studies revealed exothermic peaks in the range of 240-500 °C, i.e. above the melting point of SAC nanoparticles, with different and quite controversial explanations for this unclear phenomenon. This represents a considerable drawback for the application of nanoparticles. Correspondingly, in the current study, the thermal stability of SAC nanoparticles has been investigated via electron microscopy, XRD, FTIR, and DSC/TG analysis. It was found that the nanoparticles consist mainly of a metallic β-Sn core and an amorphous tin hydroxide shell structure. The SnO crystalline phase formation from this amorphous shell has been associated with the exothermic peaks on the first heating cycle of the nanoparticles, followed by a disproportionation reaction into metallic Sn and SnO₂.The results also revealed that the surfactant and reducing agent cannot only affect the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles, they might also alter the ratio between the amorphous shell and the crystalline core in the structure of particles.

The vascular endothelium controls vasomotor tone and microvascular flow and regulates trafficking of nutrients and biologically active molecules. When endothelial activation is excessive, compromised microcirculation and subsequent cellular hypoxia contribute to the risk of organ failure. We hypothesized that strict blood glucose control with insulin during critical illness protects the endothelium, mediating prevention of organ failure and death. In this preplanned subanalysis of a large, randomized controlled study, intensive insulin therapy lowered circulating levels of ICAM-1 and tended to reduce E-selectin levels in patients with prolonged critical illness, which reflects reduced endothelial activation. This effect was not brought about by altered levels of endothelial stimuli, such as cytokines or VEGF, or by upregulation of eNOS. In contrast, prevention of hyperglycemia by intensive insulin therapy suppressed iNOS gene expression in postmortem liver and skeletal muscle, possibly in part via reduced NF-kappaB activation, and lowered the elevated circulating NO levels in both survivors and nonsurvivors. These effects on the endothelium statistically explained a significant part of the improved patient outcome with intensive insulin therapy. In conclusion, maintaining normoglycemia with intensive insulin therapy during critical illness protects the endothelium, likely in part via inhibition of excessive iNOS-induced NO release, and thereby contributes to prevention of organ failure and death.

The biomimetic catalysis in the presence of H2O2 was tested in the dark and in daylight, and changes in reaction products were revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In all conditions, iron-porphyrin was effective in promoting complete disappearance of 2,4-DCP, although catalyst activity was enhanced in daylight (with a maximum turnover number of 85.13). Further evidence of the occurred covalent coupling between 2,4-DCP and humic molecules was revealed by diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (DOSY-NMR) spectroscopy that showed a reduced diffusivity of 2,4-DCP after the catalytic reaction. These findings indicate that iron-porphyrin is an efficient catalyst for the covalent binding of polyhalogenated phenols to humic molecules, thereby suggesting that the copolymerization reactions may become a useful technology to remediate soils and waters contaminated by halogenated phenols and their analogues.

Here, we introduce a new paradigm in MRI termed vessel architectural imaging (VAI) that exploits an overlooked temporal shift in the magnetic resonance signal, forming the basis for vessel caliber estimation, and show how this phenomenon can reveal new information on vessel type and function not assessed by any other noninvasive imaging technique. We also show how this biomarker can provide new biological insights into the treatment of patients with cancer. As an example, we demonstrate using VAI that anti-angiogenic therapy can improve microcirculation and oxygen saturation and reduce vessel calibers in patients with recurrent glioblastomas and, more crucially, that patients with these responses have prolonged survival. Thus, VAI has the potential to identify patients who would benefit from therapies.

The aim of this EP Wire was to assess the management, indications, and techniques for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device replacement in Europe. A total of 24 centres in 14 European countries completed the questionnaire. All centres were members of the European Heart Rhythm Association Electrophysiology Research Network. Replacement procedures were performed by electrophysiologists in 52% of the centres, by cardiologists in 33%, and both in the remaining centres. In the majority of centres, the procedures were performed during a short hospitalization (<2 days; 61.2%), or on an outpatient basis (28%). The overwhelming majority of centres reported that they replaced ICDs at the end of battery life. Only in a small subset (<10%) of patients with ICD for primary prevention and without ventricular tachycardia (VT) since implantation, ICD was not replaced. In inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes, 80% of the centres always replaced the ICD at the end of battery life. After VT ablation, only few centres (9%) explanted or downgraded the device that was previously implanted for secondary prevention, but only in those patients without new VT episodes. Patient's life expectancy <1 year was the most commonly reported reason (61%) to downgrade from a CRT-D to a CRT-P device. While warfarin therapy was continued in 47% of the centres, non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants were discontinued without bridging 24 h prior to replacement procedures in 60%. Finally, in 65% of the centres, VT induction and shock testing during ICD and CRT-D replacement were performed only in the case of leads with a warning or with borderline measurements. This survey provides a snapshot of the perioperative management, indications, and techniques of ICD and CRT device replacement in Europe. It demonstrates some variations between participating centres, probably related to local policies and to the heterogeneity of the ICD population.

Reports vary considerably concerning characteristics of patients who will respond to mobilizing exercises or manipulation. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to identify characteristics of patients with a changeable lumbar condition, i.e. presenting with centralization or peripheralization, that were likely to benefit the most from either the McKenzie method or spinal manipulation.


METHODS
350 patients with chronic low back pain were randomized to either the McKenzie method or manipulation. The possible effect modifiers were age, severity of leg pain, pain-distribution, nerve root involvement, duration of symptoms, and centralization of symptoms. The primary outcome was the number of patients reporting success at two months follow-up. The values of the dichotomized predictors were tested according to the prespecified analysis plan.


RESULTS
No predictors were found to produce a statistically significant interaction effect. The McKenzie method was superior to manipulation across all subgroups, thus the probability of success was consistently in favor of this treatment independent of predictor observed. When the two strongest predictors, nerve root involvement and peripheralization, were combined, the chance of success was relative risk 10.5 (95% CI 0.71-155.43) for the McKenzie method and 1.23 (95% CI 1.03-1.46) for manipulation (P = 0.11 for interaction effect).


CONCLUSIONS
We did not find any baseline variables which were statistically significant effect modifiers in predicting different response to either McKenzie treatment or spinal manipulation when compared to each other. However, we did identify nerve root involvement and peripheralization to produce differences in response to McKenzie treatment compared to manipulation that appear to be clinically important. These findings need testing in larger studies.

The Cooperative Study Group conducted a controlled study on MQ-F-OK therapy and the combination of mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin, including the intra-arterial administration of mitomycin C and doxorubicin (FAM therapy), against advanced liver cancer. Forty patients with advanced primary or secondary liver cancer were enrolled in this study and randomized into the MQ-F-OK group and the FAM group. Seventeen of the 21 cases in the MQ-F-OK group and 16 of the 19 cases in the FAM group were eligible for response evaluation in accordance with the criteria of the Japan Society for Cancer Therapy. There was no significant difference in the patient characteristics between the two groups. Three cases in the MQ-F-OK group and two in the FAM group showed partial response. There was, however, no significant difference in the response rates and the prolongation of life between the two groups. As for the side-effects, only anemia was observed more frequently in the FAM group than in the MQ-F-OK group. In conclusion, we could not preferentially recommend either MQ-F-OK therapy or FAM therapy for advanced liver cancer. The performance status of the patient was one of the most important factors in the treatment of advanced liver cancer because patients with poor performance status showed poorer results.

With the development of cartographical skills and the recognition of cartography in our area in the 16th century and especially from the 17th century on, Slovene territory was depicted equally on maps of the times through the efforts of Slovene and foreign individuals. At first, maps of individual Slovene regions dominated, but from the middle of the 19th century there are more frequent depictions of the entire Slovene territory. Cartographical work thus also became a means of expressing national demands and hopes.	['105051330']	[]	[]	2007

Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is a challenging problem. One treatment advocated to treat FBSS is epidural lysis of adhesions (LOA). The results of studies examining LOA for FBSS have been mixed, but are limited because no study has ever sought to identify factors associated with outcomes.


METHODS
We performed this multicenter, retrospective study in 115 patients who underwent LOA for FBSS (n = 104) or spinal stenosis (n = 11) between 2004 and 2007. Twenty-seven demographic, clinical, and procedural variables were extracted from medical records and correlated with the outcome, defined as ≥50% pain relief lasting ≥1 month. Univariable analysis was performed, followed by multivariable logistic regression.


RESULTS
Overall, 48.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.3%-58.1%) of patients experienced a positive outcome. In univariable analysis, those who had a positive outcome were older (mean age 64.1 years; 95% CI, 59.7-68.6 vs 57.2; 95% CI, 53.0-61.4 years; P = 0.02), while higher baseline numerical rating scale pain scores were associated with a negative outcome (mean 6.7 years; 95% CI, 6.0-7.3 vs 7.5; 95% CI, 6.9-8.0; P = 0.07). Use of hyaluronidase did not correlate with outcomes in univariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% CI, 0.6-2.5; P = 0.65). In multivariable analysis, age ≥81 years (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.4-53.7), baseline numerical rating scale score ≤9 (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.4-16.3, P = 0.02), and patients on or seeking disability or worker's compensation (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.1-19.5, P = 0.04) were significantly more likely to experience a positive outcome.


CONCLUSIONS
Considering our modest success rate, selecting patients for epidural LOA based on demographic and clinical factors may help better select treatment candidates. Procedural factors such as the use of hyaluronidase that increase risks and costs did not improve outcomes, so further research is needed before these become standard practice."

This provides the long-term patient/graft survival and outcome of BK viremia and BK virus allograft nephropathy (BKVAN) in renal transplant recipients in the setting of intensive monitoring and preemptive of reduction of immunosuppression. Quantitative BKV DNA PCR and urinary cytology surveillance were performed regularly after transplantation in 229 kidney recipients. Patients with BK viremia and BKVAN were treated with 30-50% reduction in doses of tacrolimus and/or mycophenolate mofetil and were monitored for BKV every 3-6 months. All the patients were followed for 5 years. Overall 5-year patient and graft survival were 95.6% and 92.1%, respectively, and independent of presence of decoy cells, BK viruria, viremia, or BKVAN. After reduction of immunosuppression, BK viremia (n = 38) resolved in 100% of patients, without increased acute rejection. Recurrent BK viremia was not observed in viremic patients without BKVAN (n = 30). All BKVAN patients (n = 7, 3.1%) cleared viremia with a mean time of 5.9 months (range 1-15 months) and manifested no decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate from 1 month to 5 years after transplantation. Viral monitoring and preemptive reduction of immunosuppression resulted in the successful resolution of BK viremia and BKVAN with excellent graft survival and renal function at 5 years.

Moxonidine is an I1-imidazoline receptor agonist that reduces blood pressure in hypertensives. Experimental data suggest that moxonidine inhibits central sympathetic activity. However, whether such a mechanism is involved in vivo in humans is still unclear. We investigated the effects of 0.4 mg moxonidine orally on muscle sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate in an open study in 8 healthy volunteers. Furthermore, we studied the effects of 0.4 mg moxonidine on muscle sympathetic nerve activity, heart rate, blood pressure, 24-hour blood pressure profile, and hormone plasma levels in 25 untreated hypertensives in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Moxonidine decreased muscle sympathetic nerve activity in both healthy volunteers (P<0.05 versus baseline) and hypertensives (P<0.02 versus placebo). Plasma norepinephrine also decreased (P<0. 01), whereas plasma epinephrine and renin levels did not change (P=NS). Furthermore, moxonidine decreased systolic (P<0.0001) and diastolic (P<0.001) blood pressure. Heart rate decreased after moxonidine in healthy subjects (P<0.05); in hypertensives, heart rate decreased during the night hours (P<0.05) but not during daytime (P=NS). Plasma levels of LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol were not influenced by the drug (P=NS). Moxonidine decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure by inhibiting central nervous sympathetic activity. This makes this new drug suitable for the treatment of human hypertension and possibly for other cardiovascular diseases with increased sympathetic nerve activity, ie, ischemic heart disease and heart failure.

Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has represented a significant treatment advancement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the new scenario of targeted agents, there is an increasing interest in identifying patients who gain the maximum benefit from FCR. In this observational multicenter retrospective analysis of 404 CLL patients receiving frontline FCR, the combination of three biomarkers that are widely tested before treatment (IGHV mutation status, 11q deletion and 17p deletion; available in 80% of the study cohort) allowed to identify a very low-risk category of patients carrying mutated IGHV genes but neither 11q or 17p deletion that accounted for 28% of all cases. The majority of very low-risk patients (71%) remained free of progression after treatment and their hazard of relapse decreased after 4 years from FCR. The life expectancy of very low-risk patients (91% at 5 years) was superimposable to that observed in the matched normal general population, indicating that neither the disease nor complications of its treatment affected survival in this favorable CLL group. These findings need a prospective validation and may be helpful for the design of clinical trials aimed at comparing FCR to new targeted treatments of CLL, and, possibly, for optimized disease management.

The Exercise and Nutrition Routine Improving Cancer Health (ENRICH) study is investigating a novel lifestyle intervention aimed at improving the health behaviors of adult cancer survivors and their carers. The main purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of lifestyle education and skill development delivered via group-based sessions on the physical activity and dietary behaviors of participants. This article describes the intervention development, study design, and participant recruitment.


METHODS/DESIGN
ENRICH is a randomized controlled trial, conducted in Australia, with two arms: an intervention group participating in six, two-hour face-to-face sessions held over eight weeks, and a wait-list control group. Intervention sessions are co-facilitated by an exercise physiologist and dietician. Content includes healthy eating education, and a home-based walking (utilizing a pedometer) and resistance training program (utilizing elastic tubing resistance devices). The program was developed with reference to social cognitive theory and chronic disease self-management models. The study population consists of cancer survivors (post active-treatment) and their carers recruited through community-based advertising and referral from health professionals. The primary outcome is seven-days of sealed pedometry. Secondary outcomes include: self-reported physical activity levels, dietary intake, sedentary behavior, waist circumference, body mass index, quality of life, and perceived social support. The outcomes will be measured at baseline (one week prior to attending the program), eight-weeks (at completion of intervention sessions), and 20-weeks. The intervention group will also be invited to complete 12-month follow-up data collection. Process evaluation data will be obtained from participants by questionnaire and attendance records.


DISCUSSION
No trials are yet available that have evaluated the efficacy of group-based lifestyle education and skill development amongst mixed groups of cancer survivors and their carers. The results will have implications for the planning and provision of health and support services during the cancer survivorship phase.

To compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril on intima-media thickness (IMT) in elderly, previously untreated hypertensive individuals.


DESIGN
A double-blind randomized parallel-group trial (the ELVERA trial).


PATIENTS
The study population comprised 166 newly diagnosed hypertensive individuals (aged 60-75 years) with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 115 mmHg or systolic blood pressure between 160 and 220 mmHg, or both.


INTERVENTION
Patients were allocated randomly to groups to receive amlodipine 5-10 mg or lisinopril 10-20 mg for 2 years.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Before and after 1 and 2 years of treatment, IMT was measured in three carotid and two femoral arterial sites by B-mode ultrasound. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline of the combined mean maximum far wall IMT of carotid and femoral arteries, evaluated by repeated measurement analysis of the treatment effect in an intention-to-treat analysis.


RESULTS
After 2 years of treatment, amlodipine decreased IMT by 0.089 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.144 to 0.037]. Lisinopril decreased IMT by 0.065 mm (95% CI 0.124 to 0.010). No differences between the two drugs were found (P = 0.18). Both treatment regimens achieved the greatest reduction of IMT after 1 year, with a slight increase after the second year, whereas the reduction in blood pressure was maintained. Comparing the carotid and femoral arteries, a significant treatment difference in the change from baseline in favour of amlodipine was observed in the IMT of the elastic common carotid artery (P < 0.05). The effects of the two drugs on the muscular common femoral artery were not different.


CONCLUSION
In a long-term study, amlodipine and lisinopril reduce IMT to a similar extent in newly diagnosed elderly hypertensive patients. It is suggested that the two drugs have different effects on arteries that are not prone to atherosclerosis."	['11160902', '39076536', '2136591', '13078576', '5113273', '2773250']	[]	[]	2004

They give an actualist interpretation of quantifiers that leads to very general completeness results: for any propositional modal logic S there is a quantificational proof system QS that is complete for validity in models whose algebra of admissible propositions validates S. In this paper, we construct ultraproducts of admissible models and use them to derive compactness theorems that combine with completeness to yield strong completeness: any QS-consistent set of formulas is satisfiable in a model whose admissible propositions validate S. The Barcan Formula is analysed separately and shown to axiomatise certain logics that are strongly complete over admissible models in which the quantifiers are given their standard Kripkean interpretation.

There is a rich history of medicine in Persia. Experiences and knowledge of medicine in this area continued and connected to a new era named Islamic golden age (9th–twelfth century AD). Great Persian physicians such as Raban Tabari , Rhazes, Haly Abbas, Akhawayani Bokhari, Avicenna, and jurjani all grew up, studied and worked in this period. Akhawayani Bokhari (Abubakr Rabi ibn Ahmad alAkhawayni al-Bokhara,?-died 983 AD), most likely worked and lived all his life in Bukhara, a city currently at the Republic of Uzbekistan. Bukhara was prospered during the Samanid dynasty (875–999 AD). Samanids established an autonomic state in north east of Persia and revived the Persian literature and traditions that had lost its official status after the Arab conquest in seventh century. During the Samanid rulers Persian language and culture revived and started to be used in art and sciences with increasing nationalistic vigor. Akhawayni was the student of one of the razes follower. He collected his medical experiences in a compendium named; Hidayat al-Mutaallemin fi al-Tibb (Learner’s Guide to Medicine). In this book he has referenced to his predecessors, Galen, Hippocrates, Rhazes, Yahya ibn Sarabyun, Dioscurides, Archigenes and Aristoteles, (1–3) Hidayat al-Mutaallemin fi al-Tibb is the oldest treatise on medicine written in Persian . Hidayat Al-Mutallimin fi al-Tibb consists of 185 chapters (Baabe). Five chapters are completely devoted to psychiatry, including’s; Ba ab mania (chapter on Mania),baabe Malikholia( chapter on Melancholia), baabe Kaboos (chapter incubus), Baabe Raja(chapter on pseudocyesis), Baabe Ghotrab(chapter on Hebpherenia/schizophrenia),baabe Honag-Al –Rahem ( conversion disorder ), there are also many psychiatric notes distributed in another parts of the text (4). As he quotes in his book, he had great success in the treatment of psychiatric and melancholic patient, and for this reason he was named pezeshk divanegan ( physician for the insane ). The oldest preserved script of this book (1058 AD) is the manuscript of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, The second, and third scripts are copies of the Fatih Library of Istanbul and the Iranian National Library of Malek in Tehran in succeeding (5, 8). Jalal Matini, a contemporary Persian scholar, compared the tree manuscripts and published a literary edition in 1965 (4). The following passages are extracted from this edition. Each passage is followed by simple explanation.

Hovever, recent investigations by the DOD's Naval Research Advisory Cormnittee (hRK) and the General Accountiung Office (GAO) have clearly deliniated serious problems of fleet readiness due to inadequate attention given to human factors in the ship design process. As a result there has been a noted increase in HFE participation in the design of neii ships such as the LHD, LSD-41, AOE-6 and AE-36. In addition, organization changes with NAVSEA, and the issuance of a new NAVN4T Instruction mandating HFE participation in the ship design process, provides even further opportmity for HFE to make meaningful contributions to the ships of the future. Based on the HFE participation in the above programs it is now evident that these contributions can be made without disrupting design nr construction schedules, adding significant costs, or negatively impacting the design and construction process.

Using a file of 8400 analyses of rocks of varying ages and geographic distribution it has been found that a simple ternary plot of MgO FeO(total) Al 2 O 3 may be used to distinguish five tectonic environments: ocean ridge and floor, ocean island, continental, orogenic, and spreading center island. Subalkaline “basaltic-andesites” (51–56% SiO 2 calculated anhydrous) are used in this study. Alkaline rocks do not generally show the simple patterns of tholeiitic or subalkaline rocks. The ocean island suite is bimodal with one mode tholeiitic and the other alkaline. A bimodal age/chemistry relationship in the continental suite is tentatively related to different conditions during and after active breaking up of continents (rifting and drifting stages). Most of the Archean rocks in our file generally do not fall in the orogenic field. It is unlikely that modern island arc models can be generally applied to Archean greenstone belts. Locally, however, there may be Archean rocks analogous in some respect to modern calc-alkali rocks.	['13952035', '144296924', '104886204']	[]	[]	1977

The study of markets and market prices has been a central feature of economic inquiry since the 18th Century. There have always been lingering questions on the meaning of market prices. Most moderneconomists argue that there are no normative implications to price analysis. The disclaimers of some economists about normative judgments ring hollow in the light of their vigorous advocacy of free market solutions to economic and other problems. Either free market solutions are superior alternatives or they are not; one cannot have a value free analysis and an ideological advocacy at the same time. The philosopher, Robert Nozick, in Anarchy, State, and Utopia, clearly finds meaning in the market place. His entitlement theory is predicated upon free exchange of goods and productive services. The normative use of free markets in general and of Robert Nozick's formulation in particular, it is contended, are inconsistent, illogical, and unscientific.	['98420321']	[]	[]	1979

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) consider the related symptoms disruptive to their quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the control of symptomatic paroxysmal AF (PAF) on QoL.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Patients with symptomatic PAF were treated for 48 weeks with open-label flecainide acetate controlled release (Flec CR). Quality of life was assessed by SF-36 and Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale scores at baseline, Week 12 (W12), W24, and W48. Of the 229 treated patients, 217 were analysed for QoL (123 with controlled and 94 with uncontrolled symptomatic PAF at inclusion). The controlled group had a similar or better QoL (SF-36) at baseline compared with a reference population (significantly better for: physical functioning, bodily pain, and physical component). The uncontrolled group had an inferior QoL (significantly worse for: role physical, general health, vitality, role emotional, social functioning, mental health, and mental component). When treated with Flec CR, the controlled group baseline QoL scores were maintained and the uncontrolled group scores were improved to a level comparable to the controlled group scores. Safety findings reflect the known clinical safety profile of flecainide acetate.


CONCLUSION
In this study, patients with uncontrolled symptomatic PAF at baseline had an inferior QoL to those with controlled symptomatic PAF. Following treatment with controlled-release flecainide acetate, their QoL improved to a level comparable to controlled patients."

His account is interesting and rich. I find many of the basic ideas in his theory to be on the right track. However, I think that there are still non-trivial problems related to it. The theory seems too narrow on two counts. First, Searle’s theory is too narrow in that it leaves out a central class of social institutions. This is the class consisting of social institutions relying on expectation-based social norms or, as I have called them, “proper social norms” (cf. Tuomela, 1995, Chapter 1). Second, Searle’s emphasis on deontic status and status functions seems to be too demanding in general. While it works well for some cases (e.g. money), it does not apply to all those institutional cases where a new “conceptual and social status” in a sense to be explicated is involved, nor does it apply to institutional cases which only involve norm-governed social practices.

5α-Reductase (5αR) types 1 and 2 catalyze the A-ring reduction of steroids, including androgens and glucocorticoids. 5α-R inhibitors lower dihydrotestosterone in benign prostatic hyperplasia; finasteride inhibits 5αR2, and dutasteride inhibits both 5αR2 and 5αR1. In rodents, loss of 5αR1 promotes fatty liver.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to test the hypothesis that inhibition of 5αR1 causes metabolic dysfunction in humans.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
This double-blind randomized controlled parallel group study at a clinical research facility included 46 men (20-85 years) studied before and after intervention.


INTERVENTION
Oral dutasteride (0.5 mg daily; n = 16), finasteride (5 mg daily; n = 16), or control (tamsulosin; 0.4 mg daily; n = 14) was administered for 3 months.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Glucose disposal was measured during a stepwise hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Data are mean (SEM).


RESULTS
Dutasteride and finasteride had similar effects on steroid profiles, with reduced urinary androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites and reduced circulating DHT but no change in plasma or salivary cortisol. Dutasteride, but not finasteride, reduced stimulation of glucose disposal by high-dose insulin (dutasteride by -5.7 [3.2] μmol/kg fat-free mass/min, versus finasteride +7.2 [3.0], and tamsulosin +7.0 [2.0]). Dutasteride also reduced suppression of nonesterified fatty acids by insulin and increased body fat (by 1.6% [0.6%]). Glucose production and glycerol turnover were unchanged. Consistent with metabolic effects of dutasteride being mediated in peripheral tissues, mRNA for 5αR1 but not 5αR2 was detected in human adipose tissue.


CONCLUSION

Patients/methods: Eligible patients were those with histologically confirmed urothelial cancer who had progressed or relapsed after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The PIN regimen consisted of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on day 1; ifosfamide 4.5 g/m2 divided over days 1, 2, and 3; and nedaplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 1; PIN was given every 28 days. Results: Among the 32 patients enrolled in the study (median age, 66 years), complete and partial responses were obtained in 5 patients and 19 patients, respectively, with an overall response rate of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59–91%). The median time to progression was 8 months (range, 0–50+ months) and the median survival was 22 months (range, 4–52+ months). The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 53.7 and 42.9%, respectively. All patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was seen in 8 patients; Grade 3 or 4 anemia was seen in 6 patients; Grade 3 neuropathy was observed in 1 patient, for whom the PIN therapy was discontinued. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: The PIN combination was highly active and tolerable in previously treated patients with urothelial cancer as a second-line treatment.

Agitated behaviors are one of the most frequent reasons that patients with dementia are placed in long-term care settings. This study aims to validate the ability of a custom Body Sensor Network (BSN) to capture the presence of agitation against currently accepted subjective measures, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Aggressive Behavior Scale (ABS) and to discriminate between agitation and cognitive decline.


METHODS
Six patients identified as being at high risk for agitated behaviors were enrolled in this study. The devices were applied at three sites for three hours while behaviors were annotated simultaneously and subsequently repeated twice for each enrolled subject.


RESULTS
We found that the BSN was a valid measure of agitation based on construct validity testing and secondary validation using non-parametric ANOVAs.


DISCUSSION
The BSN shows promise from these pilot results. Further testing with a larger sample is needed to replicate these results."

Few published data are available on whether the normalization of height in these children during growth hormone (GH) treatment is accompanied by proportional growth of the other parts of the body. In this study, body proportions before and during GH therapy were assessed in children with severe growth retardation due to CRF. Various body segments, such as sitting height, arm span, tibia, hand and foot length, biacromial and biiliacal diameter were measured in 15 children participating in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial and in 22 children participating in a double-blind dose-response trial. Twelve children continued GH therapy after having participated in one of the two former trials and received GH therapy for 4 years. All results were adjusted for age and sex, and expressed as SD scores using reference values for healthy Dutch children. To assess body proportions, the various body segments were related to height and expressed as shape values (SV). At baseline all body segments SD scores were significantly lower than zero, indicating that the stunted growth of children with CRF included all body segments. Since height was not significantly more or less affected than the other body segments, all children had normal SV, indicating normal body proportions. The placebo-controlled study showed a significant increase of the SD scores of height and several body segments during 6 months of GH [28 IU/m2 per week (or 1.3 mg/m2 per day)] versus placebo. The dose-response study demonstrated that height SDS as well as all other body segments SD scores increased significantly during 2 years of GH therapy with 28 IU/m2 per week, compared with treatment with 14 IU/m2 per week. Also during 4 years of GH therapy with 28 IU/m2 per week, body segment SD scores increased to the same extent as height SDS, showing that GH did not significantly change SV i.e., body proportions. Both before and during GH therapy, children on dialysis had normal body proportions, comparable with children on conservative renal treatment. In conclusion, children with severe growth retardation due to CRF maintain normal body proportions in spite of their chronic disease. GH therapy with 28 IU/m2 per week induces and maintains catch-up growth of height and all body segments without signs of disproportionate growth. Thus GH therapy does not negatively influence body proportions in children with severe growth retardation secondary to CRF.

More specifically, it is an attempt to trace the sources of one of the most important ideas in Charles Darwin's epoch-making biological synthesis of the midcentury-his idea of a struggle for existence. The choice of century, of science, and of concept is not gratuitous, for the biological sciences in mid-nineteenth-century England were in a pre-specialized, proto-professional state,1 a state peculiarly receptive to influences from without the more narrowly defined discipline of biology. The concept of a struggle for existence appears to have emerged from a complex matrix of economic, political, religious, and scientific traditions and thus affords an especially rich example for the study of extrascientific influences. Perhaps in another century, with a different science, and some other concept, external factors could be seen to play only a peripheral role, and a more or less strictly ""internalist"" approach would be considered a quite sufficient analytic methodology. Yet such an approach does not seem sufficient for the Darwin case study under question, as I hope to demonstrate in the course of this essay."	['87837342']	[]	[]	1972

Compression ultrasonography performed serially over a 7-day period is recommended for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in symptomatic pregnant women, but whether this approach is safe is unknown. We evaluated the safety of withholding anticoagulation from pregnant women with suspected deep vein thrombosis following negative serial compression ultrasonography and iliac vein imaging.


METHODS
Consecutive pregnant women who presented with suspected deep vein thrombosis underwent compression ultrasonography and Doppler imaging of the iliac vein of the symptomatic leg(s). Women whose initial test results were negative underwent serial testing on 2 occasions over the next 7 days. Women not diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis were followed for a minimum of 3 months for the development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.


RESULTS
In total, 221 pregnant women presented with suspected deep vein thrombosis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 16 (7.2%) women by initial compression ultrasonography and Doppler studies; none were identified as having deep vein thrombosis on serial testing. One patient with normal serial testing had a pulmonary embolism diagnosed 7 weeks later. The overall prevalence of deep vein thrombosis was 7.7% (17/221); of these, 65% (11/17) of cases were isolated to the iliofemoral veins and 12% (2/17) were isolated iliac deep vein thromboses. The incidence of venous thromboembolism during follow-up was 0.49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09%-2.71%). The sensitivity of serial compression ultrasonography with Doppler imaging was 94.1% (95% CI 69.2%-99.7%), the negative predictive value was 99.5% (95% CI 96.9%-100%), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.068 (95% CI 0.01-0.39).


INTERPRETATION
Serial compression ultrasonography with Doppler imaging of the iliac vein performed over a 7-day period excludes deep-vein thrombosis in symptomatic pregnant women."

Tucson, The University of Arizona Press, 2013. xv, 241 pp. $50.00 US (cloth). Maya Stanfield-Mazzi examines how ""a new religion was forged through images in the early modem Andes"" (p. 1). The author divides her book into two parts. Part I focusses on three-dimensional statues in churches, which helped Andeans envision the Christian divine, and Part II on two-dimensional paintings, mostly in private homes for personal devotion. Stanfield-Mazzi uses simple yet elegant prose in the book's seven chapters, introduction, and epilogue. Analyses of fifty black and white illustrations and nine coloured plates add to the attractiveness of this well-conceived work. Ample information on pre-Hispanic religious beliefs and customs allows the reader to understand the incorporation, acceptance, and modification of Christian symbols, representations, and doctrine. The author contends that if ""indigenous Andeans were still discouraged from acceding to the priesthood [in the late seventeenth-century], as artists they were able to participate in the visualization of Christianity"" (p. 146). The author weaves political, religious, and cultural history into the Andean religious fabric and presents fair and balanced depictions of priests who protected their flock and those who exploited them. Missionaries adopted several strategies to inculcate Catholicism. The language barrier hindered the teaching of complex religious principles and no official translation of the catechism appeared in Quechua or Aymara until 1582-83. Political struggles between Dominicans and diocesan priests and between Dominicans and Franciscans further complicated evangelization efforts, though nearly all parties agreed on the importance of destroying pre-Hispanic religious objects, ""tricks of the devil"" (p. 10). Missionaries knew that active visualization of the new faith was crucial to its success and they adopted several strategies ""to inspire devotion to God"" (p. 12). Successful efforts to instruct neophytes began around 1550 when large bultos from Spain arrived in Andean cities to populate new Christian churches with ""naturalistic, polychrome images of Christian deities"" (p. 59). Visual representations of Catholicism by the hands of Andean artists sparked the creation of a new and independent artistic tradition. Pre-Hispanic Andean traditions contributed to the ultimate preeminence of Mary and Christ in artwork and daily devotion. God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the saints received much less attention by Andean faithful and artists. Christ Crucified, prominently displayed in Cusco's Cathedral, became known as Lord of the Earthquakes after being credited with stopping the tremors on the heels of the devastating earthquake of 1650. A Virgin of the Rosary and a Virgin of the Purification became foci of devotion in Pomata and Copacabana. The Virgin's statue in Pomata was imported from Spain. The Virgin Mary in Copacabana was created by the famed Andean artist Francisco Tito Yupanqui. Both statues were accredited with performing miracles. While Amerindian artists clearly influenced this new artistic tradition, it was not because Spaniards had respect for Amerindians. …"	['12556333']	[]	[]	2015

Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is a postulated etiologic factor for multiple sclerosis, but the higher frequency with longer disease duration and progressive disability suggests that chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is secondary to chronic disease. We evaluated the presence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency in pediatric-onset MS.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-six pediatric patients with MS (18 years of age or younger), 26 age-matched healthy controls, and 13 young adults with pediatric-onset MS underwent sonography of the internal jugular, vertebral, and deep cerebral veins. Five venous hemodynamic criteria were assessed, with 2 criteria required for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. MR imaging studies, performed in the pediatric patients with MS and healthy control groups, included intracranial 2D time-of-flight MR venography and velocity-sensitive phase-contrast sequences. Contrast-enhanced brain MR images were obtained in pediatric patients with MS to further evaluate venous patency. We used paired t tests, Wilcoxon matched pairs, McNemar tests, and exact conditional logistic regression to estimate the association of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency with MS.


RESULTS
Fifty participants (73.5%) had normal ultrasound findings, 15 (23.1%) met 1 venous hemodynamic criterion, and 2 pediatric patients with MS and 1 young adult with pediatric-onset MS met chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency was not associated with MS (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 0.19-infinity). Demographic and disease characteristics did not differ between the patients with MS meeting chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria (n = 3) and those who did not (n = 36; all, P > .05). The mean (SD) MR imaging measures of intracerebral flow did not differ between the 2 pediatric patients with MS meeting chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria (0.85 ± 0.11) and healthy controls (0.87 ± 0.16, P = .50); no child demonstrated venous obstruction.


CONCLUSIONS
Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is rarely observed in children or young adults with pediatric-onset MS. Venous anatomy and flow rates indicate that venous outflow is intact in pediatric patients with MS. Our findings argue against chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency as a component of MS etiology."

Heavy metal derivatives of the galactose binding protein of Salmonella typhimurium were obtained by the treatment of crystals with carbon disulfide under anaerobic conditions, followed by exposure to mercury-containing reagents. Carbon disulfide reacts with protein amino groups to give a metastable dithiocarbamate, which is susceptible to covalent derivatization by mercurials. The number of amino groups which react for any particular crystalline protein will depend on the pH, the composition of the crystal mother liquor, and the steric accessibility limitations imposed by crystal packing. Direct reaction with protein crystals, rather than solution derivatization followed by purification and subsequent crystallization, is used to promote isomorphism of the derivative crystal with the native and to limit the number of available sites. For the S. typhimurium galactose binding protein, carbon disulfide treatment, followed by reaction with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, resulted in binding at two sites at pH 8.0. Similar treatment with dimercury acetate gave one binding site for the dimercurial at the same pH. Both derivatives were isomorphous with the native crystal to a resolution of at least 3.5 A. These heavy atom derivatives have been used to produce an interpretable electron density map of the protein at 3-A resolution.	['5754293', '2656017']	[]	[]	1983

To report a multicenter experience treating anal canal cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
From October 2000 to June 2006, 53 patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT for anal squamous cell carcinoma at three tertiary-care academic medical centers. Sixty-two percent were T1-2, and 67% were N0; eight patients were HIV positive. Forty-eight patients received fluorouracil (FU)/mitomycin, one received FU/cisplatin, and four received FU alone. All patients underwent computed tomography-based treatment planning with pelvic regions and inguinal nodes receiving a median of 45 Gy. Primary sites and involved nodes were boosted to a median dose of 51.5 Gy. All acute toxicity was scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. All late toxicity was scored using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria.


RESULTS
Median follow-up was 14.5 months (range, 5.2 to 102.8 months). Acute grade 3+ toxicity included 15.1% GI and 37.7% dermatologic toxicity; all acute grade 4 toxicities were hematologic; and acute grade 4 leukopenia and neutropenia occurred in 30.2% and 34.0% of patients, respectively. Treatment breaks occurred in 41.5% of patients, lasting a median of 4 days. Forty-nine patients (92.5%) had a complete response, one patient had a partial response, and three had stable disease. All HIV-positive patients achieved a complete response. Eighteen-month colostomy-free survival, overall survival, freedom from local failure, and freedom from distant failure were 83.7%, 93.4%, 83.9%, and 92.9%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Preliminary outcomes suggest that concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT for anal canal cancers is effective and tolerated favorably compared with historical standards."	['2508807', '6578088', '8357313', '1723785', '5173656', '2204384', '3479683', '2131856', '5555408', '3574528']	[]	[]	2007

Triphasic contrast-enhanced CT images (16-MDCT, 1.25-mm collimation, 5-mm thickness, 6.1-s acquisition time for each phase) were obtained with 2 mL/kg injection of 300 mgI/mL iodine contrast material in 116 patients. Patients were prospectively randomized into two groups: one receiving contrast medium for 25-s injection duration and the other for 35-s injection duration. In both groups, triphasic scans were initiated 5, 15, and 40s after the completion of contrast injection for the first, second and third phases, respectively. CT values (HU) in the abdominal aorta, liver, spleen, pancreas, splenic and superior mesenteric arteries, and veins (splenic, superior mesenteric, portal, and hepatic) were measured. Quantitative and qualitative analysis for the degree of contrast enhancement between the two groups in various organs was compared at each scan phase.


RESULTS
The aortic and arterial enhancements in the first-phase scan were higher for the 25-s group than those of the 35-s group (P<.001). Hepatic enhancement was higher for the 35-s group in the first (P<.001) and second (P<.01) phases, but no difference in the third-phase. No difference was found between the groups for the pancreatic enhancement at any phases. Qualitative results were in good agreement with quantitative results.


CONCLUSION
Contrast administration with shorter injection duration increased peak aortic and arterial enhancement and contributed to improvement in the quality of CT angiograms, but for the solid abdominal organs 35-s protocol is recommended."

Causative factors of uremia-associated atherosclerosis are complex. However, it is likely that atherogenic lipoproteins accumulated in plasma are involved. Remnant lipoproteins are atherogenic and are frequently observed in uremic plasma. LDL from uremic patients has been shown to be susceptible to in vitro peroxidation, suggesting that oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) could be excessively generated in those patients. No effective treatments to prevent accumulation of both atherogenic lipoproteins in dialysis patients have been published. Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) may change synthesis and/or catabolism of remnant lipoproteins and increase stability of LDL to peroxidation by altering the fatty acid composition of lipoproteins. A prospective comparative study was conducted to assess the efficacy of EPA on metabolism of remnant lipoproteins and ox-LDL in dialysis patients using two new methods: an immunoaffinity gel separation for quantifying plasma remnant lipoproteins and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring plasma ox-LDL levels, a marker for in vivo LDL peroxidation. Twenty-two hemodialysis and 16 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients with relatively high plasma levels of remnant lipoproteins and ox-LDL were randomized to either EPA or placebo. Highly purified EPA, in an ethyl-ester form (ethyl all-cis-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentanoate) with a purity greater than 91%, was administered at a dose of 1800 mg daily. Overall, 3 mo of treatment with EPA significantly reduced the levels of both remnant lipoproteins (52% reduction) and ox-LDL (38% reduction). Additionally, gel filtration chromatography of lipoproteins showed that EPA treatment concomitantly normalized other potential abnormalities in lipoproteins. Treatment compliance was good and no critical adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, EPA administration proved to be effective and safe treatment to decrease plasma remnant lipoproteins and prevent in vivo peroxidation of LDL in dialysis patients.

This paper systematically analyses REE and 16 trace elements such as U, Th, Sr, Ba, Co, Ni, Cr, V, Cu, Pb, Zn, Sc, Au, As in sedimentary rocks and the agustite on the standard stratified section of the Cambrian-Ordovician Boundary in Dayangcha, Huniiang, Jilin Province. Based on this, the authors investigate the REE distribution pattern and the law of the contents and compositions of trace elements changing, providing the geochemical evidence for building stratified sections of the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary and discussing sedimentary environments.

The effects of effortful attention on ERPs to loud noises and the effects of stimulus intrusiveness on effortfully elicited ERPs were studied. First, ERPs to task relevant and irrelevant startling noises were compared. Second, ERPs to startling noises and moderate tones were compared when both were targets. The effects of age (young vs. elderly controls) and effects of dementing disease (AD subjects vs. elderly controls) were also assessed. Effortful attention augmented noise-elicited P300 amplitude in elderly subjects, but not in young. Intrusiveness augmented task-relevant P300 amplitude in young subjects, but not in elderly. Neither variable affected P300 amplitude in AD subjects. Thus, effects of age and disease depended on how P300 was elicited: when effortfully elicited, P300 amplitude was affected by disease but not age; when automatically elicited, P300 amplitude was affected by age but not disease. N1 effects differed from P300 effects.

Recently, reconstructions with double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (DLSG) grafts have become common. The prevailing opinion is that ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon graft produces a more stable knee with more anterior knee pain than DLSG grafts, while the functional results and knee scores are similar. The present study evaluates BPTB grafts fixed with metallic interference screws and DLSG grafts fixed with Bone Mulch Screw on the femur and WasherLoc fixation on the tibia. All else being the same, there is no difference in the outcome between the two grafts and fixation methods. This is a prospective randomized multicenter study. A total of 115 patients with isolated ACL ruptures were randomized to either reconstruction with BPTB grafts fixed with metal interference screws (58 patients) or DLSG grafts (57 patients) fixed with Bone Mulch Screws and WasherLoc Screws. Follow-up was at one and two years; the latter by an independent observer. At two years, one ACL revision had been performed in each group. Eight patients in the DLSG group and one in the BPTB group underwent meniscus surgery in the follow-up period (P = 0.014). Mean Lysholm score at the two year follow-up was 91 (SD ± 10.3) in the DLSG group and also 91 (SD ± 10.2) in the BPTB group. Mean KT-1000 at two years was 1.5 mm in the BPTB group and 1.8 mm in the DLSG group (n.s.). At two years, four patients in the BPTB group and three in the DLSG group had a Lachman test grade 2 or 3 (n.s.). More patients in the BPTB group had pain at the lower pole of the patella (P = 0.04). Peak flexion torque and total flexion work were lower in the DLSG group at one year (P = 0.003 and P = 0.000) and total flexion work also at two years (P = 0.05). BPTB ACL reconstruction fixed with interference screws and DLSG fixed with Bone Mulch Screws on the femur and WasherLoc Screws on the tibia produce satisfactory and nearly identical outcomes. Among our patients in the DLSG group, flexion strength was lower, and more patients underwent meniscus surgery in the follow-up period. The BPTB group has more anterior knee pain.

Vulnerability of these structures is due to various reasons such as designing without considering seismic regulations, problems of regulations (design goals), implementation problems, changing of the building occupancy class, increasing the weight of building stories, adding new stories to the building and changing in architecture of building without considering structural system. So the main objective of this research is to examine the features of building configuration and their effects as for the damages to buildings in past earthquakes. For this purpose, initially four occurred earthquakes in Iran are selected as case study. Then three types of buildings (steel structure, concrete structure and masonry buildings) are analyzed with details. Results showed that the most of damages are occurred in the old steel structures and masonry buildings which their ages are more than 25 years. The study showed that most of the buildings in the study area are steel structure and masonry buildings while concrete structures are infrequent which most of them had no or slight damages. Therefore, the importance and need to enhance the performance of available buildings against earthquake forces by rehabilitating methods would be more important than before. Also results indicated that the decisions related to architectural plan which have significant effect on seismic performance of buildings, can be divided into three categories: configuration of building, restrictive formal architectural plan and dangerous structural components, as these categories are not obstacle of each other, it is possible that each category has an influential effect on others. So organizing the design decisions in this way is very important so as to manage their effects and interdependencies.

Consumption of fish or fish oils rich in the n-3 long chain PUFA EPA and DHA may improve multiple risk factors for CVD. The objective of this study was to determine whether regular consumption of foods enriched with n-3 long-chain PUFA can improve n-3 long-chain PUFA status (erythrocytes) and cardiovascular health. Overweight volunteers with high levels of triacylglycerols (TG; >1.6 mmol/l) were enrolled in a 6-month dietary intervention trial conducted in Adelaide (n 47) and Perth (n 39), and randomised to consume control foods or n-3-enriched foods to achieve an EPA + DHA intake of 1 g/d. Test foods were substituted for equivalent foods in their regular diet. Erythrocyte fatty acids, plasma TG and other CVD risk factors were monitored at 0, 3 and 6 months. There were no significant differences between groups for blood pressure, arterial compliance, glucose, insulin, lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP) or urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 (TXB2) over 6 months, even though regular consumption of n-3-enriched foods increased EPA + DHA intake from 0.2 to 1.0 g/d. However, the n-3 long-chain PUFA content of erythrocytes increased by 35 and 53 % at 3 and 6 months, respectively, in subjects consuming the n-3-enriched foods. These increases were positively associated with measures of arterial compliance and negatively associated with serum CRP and urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion. Sustainable increases in dietary intakes and erythrocyte levels of n-3 long-chain PUFA can be achieved through regular consumption of suitably enriched processed foods. Such increases may be associated with reduced CV risk.

Early predictors to identify patients at a high risk for not succeeding the initiated treatment would be very useful. Discontinuation of the initiated treatment was used as criterion for effectiveness and patients' drug attitude was shown to be predictive for non-adherence or discontinuation of long-term treatment in schizophrenia. Accordingly, the predictive validity of the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) for effectiveness should be evaluated. Based on a sub-sample of patients from the EUFEST study for whom DAI assessments were available significant predictors for effectiveness as measured by discontinuation of initiated treatment were identified based on a logistic and a Cox-regression analysis. A Receiver-Operating Characteristic- (ROC-) analysis was conducted for the DAI, prognostic / diagnostic parameters (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated and a cut-off value suggested. In a sample of 228 first-episode patients, the DAI score was the most powerful predictor for effectiveness (p<0.001) besides two other significant predictors (PANSS-positive score and sexual side effects). The ROC-analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.64 (p<0.001). The suggested cut-off point of about 20 yielded a sensitivity of 70-75% and a specificity of 40-45%. Study results indicate that the Drug Attitude Inventory, filled in by patients early in treatment seems to be a valid predictor for effectiveness as measured by discontinuation of the initiated treatment. DAI scores could also serve as an (differential) indicator for the need of enhanced treatment monitoring. These findings have to be validated in other (first-episode) samples.
